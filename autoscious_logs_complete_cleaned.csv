Abstract
The optimization of antibodies is a desirable goal towards the development of better therapeutic strategies. The antibody
11K2 was previously developed as a therapeutic tool for inflammatory diseases, and displays very high affinity (4.6 pM) forits antigen the chemokine MCP-1 (monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1). We have employed a virtual library of mutations
of 11K2 to identify antibody variants of potentially higher affinity, and to establish benchmarks in the engineering of a
mature therapeutic antibody. The most promising candidates identified in the virtual screening were examined by surfaceplasmon resonance to validate the computational predictions, and to characterize their binding affinity and key
thermodynamic properties in detail. Only mutations in the light-chain of the antibody are effective at enhancing its affinity
for the antigen in vitro , suggesting that the interaction surface of the heavy-chain (dominated by the hot-spot residue
Phe101) is not amenable to optimization. The single-mutation with the highest affinity is L-N31R (4.6-fold higher affinitythan wild-type antibody). Importantly, all the single-mutations showing increase affinity incorporate a charged residue (Arg,
Asp, or Glu). The characterization of the relevant thermodynamic parameters clarifies the energetic mechanism. Essentially,
the formation of new electrostatic interactions early in the binding reaction coordinate (transition state or earlier) benefitsthe durability of the antibody-antigen complex. The combination of in silico calculations and thermodynamic analysis is an
effective strategy to improve the affinity of a matured therapeutic antibody.

Introduction
The exquisite specificity and high affinity of antibodies are
increasingly exploited for therapeutic and biotechnological pur-poses, such as in cancer immunotherapy, in diagnosis, and inmolecular bio-sensors [1–3]. Biobetter, defined as the biomedicinesuccessfully developed through functional and/or physicochemicalimprovement of a natural molecule, provides a promising strategyfor the next generation of therapeutics [4]. However, theoptimization of the physicochemical properties of an antibodywithout perturbing the affinity and specificity for the cognatemolecule is a challenging endeavor. Progress in this field isaccelerating, and successful examples of improved antibodies usingbiobetter strategies have been reported, such as higher affinity forthe cognate, increased stability in solution, enhanced pharmaco-kinetics, diminished immunogenicity, or conjugation to drug
delivery systems [5–9]. Nevertheless, to advance further thedeployment of biobetter strategies in the design and preparation of
improved therapeutics it is necessary to strengthen our under-
standing of the physicochemical properties of engineered antibod-
ies [10].
The interaction surface of antibody-antigen complexes involves
a large number of residues and water molecules establishing
multiple non-covalent interactions that are difficult to quantify at
the molecular and atomic levels. Although the evaluation of
protein-protein binding energy remains a challenging task,
progress in computing performance and force-field parametriza-
tion are rapidly advancing our predictive capabilities [11,12].
Thus structure-based computational techniques are increasingly
employed in the design of biotherapeutic antibodies [13].
Herein, we report the improvement of the binding affinity of the
mature antibody 11K2 for its target antigen MCP-1 (monocyte
chemotactic protein-1), an important therapeutic target in
inflammatory diseases such as arteriosclerosis [14], allergy [15],
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87099and rheumatoid arthritis [16]. The design of an optimized version
of the antibody 11K2 with enhanced binding capabilities mayimprove its therapeutic value in the treatment of inflammatorydiseases. Although the binding affinity of 11K2 for its antigen isvery high (4.6 pM) [17], the analysis of the crystal structure of theantibody-antigen complex (PDB entry code 2BDN) suggests how
to further increase the affinity by optimizing the complementary
determining region (CDR) of the variable domain of the lightchain (V
L) (Figure 1) [18]. Indeed, the interaction surface between
the CDR of the V Lof 11K2 and the antigen is 257 A ˚2, a value
significantly smaller than that of the CDR of the variable domainof the heavy chain (V
H) (511 A ˚2) [19]. Moreover, the evaluation of
the thermodynamic properties of the engineered antibodies is adesirable goal towards increasing our predictive capabilities infuture optimization strategies.
In this report we have calculated the binding energy between
MCP-1 and a virtual library of systematic mutations at each of the62 residues of the CDR of the antibody 11K2 by computationalmethods. The in silico calculations suggest that single-mutations
carrying charged residues at specific locations favor the bindingenergy with the antigen. The affinity of the most promisingcandidates was determined experimentally by the technique ofsurface plasmon resonance (SPR), which identified several muteins
with enhanced affinity for the antigen. The thermodynamic
analysis reveals the fundamental mechanism explaining thesuperior binding capabilities of the optimized antibody. Our studyhighlights the benefits of combining in silico and in vitro
methodologies for a more effective molecular design by biobetterstrategies.
Materials and Methods
Comprehensive mutagenesis in silico
Each of the 62 residues belonging to the CDR of 11K2 (as
defined by Kabat [20] and Chothia [21]) were subjected tosystematic mutagenesis in silico with each of the other 19 natural
amino acids (62 619 = 1,178 mutations). The initial coordinates
of 11K2 in complex with MCP-1 were retrieved from the PDB(entry code 2BDN). For each mutation in the antibody, 100randomized models were generated using the default parametersof the program MODELLER of the Discovery Studio Suite(Accerlys, San Diego, CA) [22]. Each model of the mutatedantibody-antigen complex was optimized by a combination ofsimulated annealing followed by molecular mechanics minimiza-tion until the mean square gradient decreased below 0.01 kcalmol
21A˚22. The interaction energy between antigen and antibody
in each of the 117,800 models was calculated using the defaultvalues in the module Einteract of the package software MOE(Chemical Computing Group, Canada) using the AMBER99 forcefield after hydrogen atoms were explicitly added and minimized.We used the default dielectric constant (80.0), mimicking thebehavior of water. Structural models of muteins lacking non-covalent interactions with the antigen were not considered forfurther analysis. For each mutation tested, the electrostatic andvan der Waals interaction energies were summed up and appliedas a surrogate to evaluate the affinity of the mutant for the antigen,as described previously [23]. As a reference we built 1,000 modelstructures of native antibody by optimizing the x-ray structureusing the program MODELLER as explained above. Mutationsdisplaying histograms with more favorable energy of interactionthan that of wild type protein were selected for in vitro
examination (H-L27R, H-L27K, H-N28D, H-N28Q, H-D31E,L-Y30K, L-N31R, L-N31K, L-S53D, L-S53E, L-T56D, L-T56E)(see a representative example in Figure S1).Expression and purification of MCP-1
The DNA encoding MCP-1 was synthesized by GeneArt
(Regensbyrg, Germany) and sequence-optimized for expression inEscherichia coli (Table S1). The MCP-1 gene was expressed in a
vector pET26b (Novagen) displaying a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminus. The DNA sequence was confirmed by the dideoxychain-termination method.
E. coli strain Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen) transformed with
the expression vector of MCP-1 were grown at 28 uCi n26YT
broth. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mMisopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside when the optical density at
600 nm reached a value of 0.6. Cells were allowed to grow for anadditional 16 h at 28 uC. The cells were harvested by centrifuga-
tion at 8,000 6gfor 8 min and the pellet thus obtained was
resuspended in 40 ml of a solution containing 0.5 M NaCl and
50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 (buffer A). Cells were subsequentlylysed by the sonication method with an ultrasonic cell-disruptorinstrument (Tommy) for 15 min (Output 7, Duty 50). A compactpellet containing the soluble intracellular components wasobtained by centrifugation at 40,000 6gfor 30 min. The soluble
fraction was collected and applied onto a Ni-NTA column(Novagen) equilibrated with buffer A. Protein was eluted withstepwise increase of imidazole (10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, and300 mM) in buffer A. The fractions containing MCP-1 werepooled, and subjected to size exclusion chromatography using aHiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75-pg column (GE Healthcare) equili-brated with 50 mM Tris, NaCl 500 mM, EDTA 1 mM at pH 7.4.
Expression and purification of 11K2 scFv
The DNA encoding the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of
11K2 was chemically synthesized by GeneArt and sequence-optimized for expression in E. coli (Table S1). The 11K2 scFv
construct was expressed in vector pUTE [24] displaying a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminus. The DNA sequence was confirmedby the dideoxy chain-termination method.
Cells of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) were transformed
with the expression vector of 11K2 scFv and grown at 28 uCi nL B
broth. Protein expression, cell harvesting, and cell lysis wereperformed as described above for MCP-1. A compact pelletcontaining the insoluble intracellular components was obtained bycentrifugation at 7,500 6gfor 30 min. SDS-PAGE analysis and
western blotting were conducted using the insoluble fraction(Figure S2). The soluble fraction was discarded. The insolublefraction was then solubilized with 6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.5 MNaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl overnight at 4 uC. After solubilization,
11K2 scFv was purified in a Ni-NTA column (Novagen) asdescribed above for MCP-1, except that the equilibration andelution buffers were supplemented with 6 M guanidine-HCl(denaturing conditions).
The purified antibody was refolded by the stepwise dialysis
method [25]. Briefly, 11K2 scFv was diluted to 7.5
mM with 6 M
Guanidine-HCl in 0.2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0), followed by stepwise dialysis to remove the denaturant.In order to increase the refolding efficiency, 0.2 M L-Arg-HCl wasadded to the dialysis solution to minimize protein aggregationwhen the concentration of guanidine-HCl decreased to 1–0.5 M.The refolded antibody was further purified on a HiLoad 26/60Superdex 75-pg column equilibrated with a solution containing0.2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). Thesame protocol was employed for the purification of the antibodymuteins.Optimization of a Therapeutic Antibody
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87099Binding Assays by SPR
The interaction between MCP-1 and wild-type 11K2 scFv (or
muteins) was analyzed by SPR in a Biacore T200 instrument (GEHealthcare). Research grade CM5 Biacore sensor chip (GEHealthcare) was activated by a short treatment with N-hydro-xysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimidehydrochloride, followed by immobilization of the antigen MCP-1
at a surface density of ,220 RU. The activated groups on the
surface of the sensor were subsequently blocked by injecting 100
ml
of a solution containing 1 M ethanolamine. The kinetic data of thebinding of 11K2 scFv to the antigen were obtained by injectingincreasing concentration of antibody into the sensor chip at a flowrate of 30
ml/min. The measurements were carried out in PBS
containing 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20. Contact time and dissociation
time were 5 min and 20 min, respectively. Data analysis was
performed with the BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare).Association ( k
on) and dissociation ( koff) rate constants werecalculated by a global fitting analysis assuming a Langmuir
binding model and a stoichiometry of (1:1). The dissociation
constant ( KD) was determined from the ratio of the rate constants
[26]:
KD~koff=kon
Calculation of thermodynamic parameters
Changes in enthalpy ( DHu) and entropy ( DSu) were calculated
from the slope and intercept, respectively, of the temperature
dependence of the dissociation constant using the van’t Hoff
approximation [27]:
lnKD~DH0=RTzDS0=R
where Ris the gas constant and Tis the absolute temperature.
The activation energy parameters were obtained from the
temperature dependence of the association rate constant following
the Eyring approximation:
ln (kon=T)~{ (DH{=RT )z(DS{=R)zln (kB=h)
where konis the association rate constant, DH{is the activation
enthalpy, Ris the gas constant, Tis the absolute temperature, DS{
is the activation entropy, kBis the Boltzmann’s constant, and his
the Plank’s constant.
Results
Computational Selection of Favorable Mutations
To improve the high-affinity of antibody 11K2 for its antigen
MCP-1 we selected potentially favorable mutations from a virtual
screening ( in silico ) consisting of 1,178 single mutations (19
mutations for each of the 62 residues composing the CDR loops).

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87099The force field AMBER99 as implemented in the software MOE
was used to perform 100 energy minimizations of each mutation(total was 117,800 minimizations), and the corresponding values ofenergy were subsequently plotted as histograms (Figure S1). Theoverall shape of the histogram and the median were used toestimate the relative efficacy of each mutation with respect to wild-type antibody. The relative energies of two representative sets ofvirtual mutations are shown in Figure 2. The residues examined inthe example are L-Asp31 and L-Ser53, which are located in thefirst and second CDR of the V
Lchain, respectively. In a large
number of virtual mutations, the change of energy is compara-tively small (less than 63 kcal mol
21). The greatest differences are
observed in virtual muteins displaying charged residues (Arg, Lys,Glu or Asp). In some cases, the substitution by a charged residueincreases the attractive energy, whereas in other cases the value ofenergy becomes clearly unfavorable. For example, the calculatedenergy of mutein L-N31R is clearly more advantageous forbinding the antigen than that of wild-type antibody ( DE
L2N31R=215.4 kcal mol21), whereas the relative change of energy in
mutein L-S53R is clearly destabilizing ( DEL2S53R= 8.9 kcal
mol21). Mutations displaying very favorable changes of energy in
Figure 2 were selected for experimental validation by thetechnique of SPR (muteins L-D31R, L-D31K, L-S53D, and L-S53E). The following muteins were also selected from the wholevirtual screening and examined by SPR: H-L27R, H-L27K, H-N28D, H-N28Q, H-D31E, L-Y30K, L-T56D, L-T56E. We notethat 11 muteins from a total of 12 selected mutations involvedcharged residues (92%).
Evaluation of the affinity by SPR
The kinetic rate constants of the binding of wild-type scFv 11K2
(and single-muteins) to immobilized antigen MCP-1 were exam-ined by SPR (Figure 3, Table 1). The injection of the antibody to asurface decorated with antigen produces an increase of the SPRsignal that is correlated with the association constant rate ( k
on)
(Figure 3A). The dissociation rate constant ( koff) is determined
from the signal decay after depleting the solutions from antibody.The values of k
onandkoffdetermined at 25 uC were 14 6104M21
s21and 1.061024s21, respectively, corresponding to a dissoci-
ation constant ( KD) of 0.8 nM. The small values of koffindicate
slow dissociation rates 2a clear evidence of tight binding of the
antibody to the antigen.
The values of kon,koff, and KDwere also determined for each
mutein (Figure 4, Table 1). Significant differences emerge from thecomparison of their binding affinities. Whereas a majority ofmutations of the CDR of the V
Lchain give rise to a robust
increase of affinity with respect to the parent antibody (70% ofmutations), all mutations belonging to the V
Hchain destabilize the
antibody-antigen complex. Overall, the mutation with the mostfavorable effect for the affinity is L-N31R. This mutein binds 4.7-fold stronger to the antigen than the wild-type antibody (Figure3B;k
on=1 36104M21s21;koff= 0.2261024s21;KD= 0.17
nM). Every mutein exhibiting higher affinity for the antigen thanthat determined for wild-type antibody also displays slower k
off
values. In contrast, the destabilizing mutations, without exception,
accelerate the dissociation of the antibody from the antigen. Thusthe simple examination of k
offpredicts the outcome of the
mutation in this particular antibody-antigen system.
Because the mutein L-N31R (displaying the most favorable
effect on affinity) incorporates the positively charged residue Arg

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87099we next examined the effect of the ionic strength in three different
solutions containing 137, 300 and 500 mM NaCl (Figure 5). Nomajor differences are observed in the kinetic rate constants ( k
onor
koff) or the affinity constant ( KD) of wild-type antibody. Similarly,
the kinetic parameters do not change dramatically in mutein L-
N31R, although we note that the values of kondecrease slowly but
progressively from a value of 17 6104M21s21in 137 mM NaCl,
to a value of 13 6104M21s21in 500 mM NaCl (25% decrease).
Similarly, the affinity also decreases by approximately 25% asmanifested by an increase of K
Dfrom a value of 0.36 nM to a
value of 0.47 nM. The data indicate a modest role of electrostatic
interactions, but only during the association ( kon) phase.
Thermodynamic characterization
Thermodynamic parameters for the wild-type antibody and for
the optimized muteins were obtained from the temperaturedependence of the dissociation constant, as described previously(Figure 6, Table 2) [28,29]._ENREF_28 The van’t Hoff enthalpy(DH
u) and the entropy ( 2TDSu, calculated at 25 uC) corresponding
to the binding of scFv 11K2 to MCP-1 displayed negative values
(DHuWT =27.3 kcal mol21,2TDSuWT =25.0 kcal mol21)
indicating favorable contributions from both energetic terms to thefree energy of binding ( DGuWT=212.3 kcal mol21). Important-
ly, the contribution of the enthalpic term increased substantially in
the muteins. For example, the value of DHuof L-N31R is 3.5-fold
more favorable to binding than that of wild-type antibody ( DHuL-
N31R =225.6 kcal mol21,DDHuL-N31R =218.3 kcal mol21).
The change of binding enthalpy of L-N31R is largely (but notcompletely) compensated by unfavorable changes of entropy(2TDS
uL-N31R = 12.3 kcal mol21,2TDDSuL-N31R = 17.3 kcal
mol21,T=2 5 uC) resulting in a small advantageous change of
free energy with respect to the wild-type antibody ( DGuL-N31R =
213.3 kcal mol21,DDGuL-N31R =21.0 kcal mol21). Similarly,
the other muteins exhibit favorable changes of enthalpy notcompletely compensated by the entropy term. The thermody-namic analysis clearly demonstrates the favorable contribution ofthe enthalpy to the improved affinity, suggesting that themutations generate additional non-covalent interactions betweenthe antigen and antibody in agreement with the in silico
calculations performed above.
Energetic analysis of the transition state
The activation energy of each antibody-antigen complex was
determined from the temperature dependence of kon(Table 3,
Figure 5. Effect of the ionic strength. (A) Association rate constant ( kon), (B) dissociation rate constant ( koff), and ( C) dissociation constant ( KD).
The kinetic parameters of the binding of wild-type 11K2 (or mutein L-N31R) to the antigen MCP-1 were determined in running buffer containing
three different concentrations of NaCl (137, 300, or 500 mM) at 25 uC.

defined by the unfavorable interactions in the transition state ( DH{

or remodeling of protein-protein interactions during the ratedetermining step ( DG
{
WT,assoc = 10.6 kcal mol21
,DH{
WT, assoc =
11.4 kcal mol21,2TDS{
WT,assoc =20.8 kcal mol21). The
relative activation free energy of the muteins does not changesignificantly with respect to the wild-type antibody(20.5,DDG
{
MUT,assoc ,0.3). In contrast, the change of enthalpy
of the muteins is more advantageous (less unfavorable) than that ofwild-type antibody ( 26.9,DDH
{
MUT, assoc,210.7 kcal mol21),
suggesting the formation of additional non-covalent interactionsbetween the optimized antibody and the antigen during thetransition state (Figure 7A). The values of change of enthalpy inthe transition state are correlated with the values of change ofenthalpy in equilibrium (Figure 7A). The negative values ofenthalpy at equilibrium ( DDH
uMUT) and at the transition state
(DDH{
MUT, assoc) demonstrate that the charged residues introduced
in the optimized antibody improve the enthalpic contribution tobinding. These observations suggest that the charged residuesestablish electrostatic interactions with the antigen, as depicted in amodel of the antibody antigen complex (Figure 7B). The novelinteractions are formed early in the complexation reaction, sincethey play an important role early in the energetic profile of thetransition state. In the transition state, these non-covalentinteractions are perfectly counterbalanced by unfavorable changesof entropy, reflecting the loss of configurational energy at the rate-
limiting step incurred by the approaching proteins ( 2TDDS
{
MU-
T,assoc = 7.1,10.7 kcal mol21, calculated at 25 uC) (Figure S4).
Although the free energy barrier that the muteins overcome in thetransition state is nearly identical within experimental error to thatdetermined for wild-type antibody ( DDG
{,0), their energetic
pathway towards the antibody-antigen complex in equilibrium
differs from each other.
Discussion
The affinity of the therapeutic antibody 11K2 for its antigen,
the inflammatory cytokine MCP-1, was enhanced up to ,5 fold
by employing structure-based computational design. Engineeredversions of the antibody were first designed in silico and
subsequently verified by in vitro techniques using a recombinant
scFv construct. The detailed thermodynamic characterizationrevealed the physicochemical principles involved and the operat-ing mechanism.
The selection of suitable candidates of potentially higher affinity
among a library of 1,178 virtual mutations was carried out bycomputational energy minimizations, and the most promisingcandidates (12 single-mutations) examined experimentally by SPR.Five candidates were mutated at the V
Hchain, whereas seven
candidates were mutated at the V Lchain. In five cases the affinity
of the optimized antibody increased with respect to the wild-typeantibody (42% of muteins tested) 2a high success rate.

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87099Importantly, only mutations made in the V Lchain led to higher
affinity (five favorable muteins from a total of seven muteinsexamined, i.e. 71% success rate). Such domain bias contrasts withother computationally-based optimizations, in which favorablemuteins are evenly distributed among V
Hand V Lchains (reviewed
in Kuroda et al, 2012) [13]. The deleterious effect of mutations at
VHfor the binding of antigen reflects the excellent optimization of
this region in the wild type antibody, both in terms of interactionsurface (511 A ˚
2for V H; but only 257 A ˚2for V L) and the presence
of a hot-spot residue (Figure 4) [18,30]. In other words, anymodification of the V
Hchain by site-directed mutagenesis disturbs
the carefully orchestrated interaction surface with the antigen andconsequently reduces the binding affinity.
The single-mutations selected from the virtual screening
incorporate, in 92% of the cases, a charged residue. Thisobservation emphasizes the importance of the electrostatic forcesin the computational optimization. In two previous studies theoptimized antibodies incorporated multiple mutations in theirprimary sequences [31,32]. For example, the improvement of thebinding affinity of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (10-fold) required a triple mutation [31], whereas the optimization of
the antibody Y0101 for the antigen VEGF (9-fold) is achieved byincorporating a total of six mutations [32]. Similarly, otherexamples of antibody engineering not employing electrostaticoptimization also required multiple mutations as described in twoseparate studies (between three and fourteen mutations) [33,34].In contrast, our best design achieves a considerable increase ofaffinity for a matured antibody (5-fold) but requiring only a single-mutation, an approach less likely to alter the three-dimensionalstructure of the antibody. We have not examined two or moresimultaneous mutations of 11K2, an approach that could yield anoptimized antibody displaying even higher affinity than that of thesingle-muteins generated herein.
The enhanced affinity of the optimized 11K2 antibodies is
correlated with slower dissociation rate constants ( k
off) rather than
faster association rate constants ( kon). On the contrary, the
destabilizing mutations accelerate the dissociation step, indicatingthatk
offis a valid parameter to predict the effect of the mutation
on the affinity of this particular antibody-antigen complex. Aprevious report suggested that the dissociation step is a first orderTable 3. Activation energy of association of scFv 11K2 to MCP-1.

Figure 7. Analysis of the binding enthalpy. (A) Favorable changes of binding enthalpy with respect to wild-type antibody at the transition state
(empty bar, DDH`) and at equilibrium (filled bar, DDHu). (B) Suggested model of the new interactions formed at the antibody/antigen contact surface
upon mutation. Residues depicted in yellow and dark green correspond to 11K2 and MCP-1, respectively. The conformation of the side-chain of the
mutated residues was modeled from the Dunbrak library of rotamers [44] as implemented in the program Chimera [45] (the most probably rotamer
was always selected, except in L-Arg31, where the second most probable rotamer was chosen). Because Lys35 of MCP-1 is not interacting with aneighboring residue in the crystal structure, the conformation of this residue was also modeled as above. The dotted lines and distances representputative interactions between the mutated residues and the antigen.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087099.g007Optimization of a Therapeutic Antibody
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87099reaction whose rate is dictated by the strength of short range
interactions between the proteins (van der Waals forces, hydrogenbond, hydrophobic effect, and salt bridges) [35]. Our resultsconvincingly demonstrate that introducing a charged residue in11K2 increase the affinity for the antigen and slows down k
off.
The examination of the thermodynamic parameters (Table 2)
indicates that the optimization of the affinity of the antibody-antigen complex is the result of beneficial contributions ofenthalpic nature originating in the transition state ( DDH
{,0). It
is important to understand the underlying mechanism in terms ofthe reaction coordinate diagram or ‘‘interaction pathway’’ (Figure8) [36–39]. First, antigen and antibody collide with each otherforming the so-called encounter complex ( msec scale) leading to a
weakly interacting complex in which the hydration of the proteinsurface is not altered significantly (not shown) [36,40]._EN-REF_35 The encounter complex progress towards the transitionstate, although with low efficiency [41]. In the transition state, theantigen-antibody partners lose their hydration layers at theinteraction surfaces, and a reconfiguration of intra- and inter-molecular forces takes place. Our results indicate that thebeneficial effect of the mutations to the enthalpy in the transitionstate ( DDH
{,0) is also preserved in the equilibrium complex
(DDHu,0). In other words, the electrostatic interactions generated
in the optimized muteins are actively contributing to binding earlyin the reaction coordinate, perhaps as early as in the encountercomplex, which is a state particularly sensitive to long-rangecoulombic forces [36]. The new and favorable non-covalentinteractions of the optimized muteins are not entirely translatedinto higher affinity of a similar energetic magnitude, since theentropy/enthalpy compensation effect reduces the influence of theenthalpy advantage in the free energy [42,43]. Our data indicatesthat ultimately the enthalpy advantage prevails over the entropicdisadvantage in the final antigen-antibody complex albeit with low
efficiency since only 5% of the favorable enthalpy is converted in
useful free energy (Figure S4).In summary, we illustrate the benefits of using computational
methods to design an optimized antibody with higher binding
affinity for its cognate antigen. In particular, the incorporation of
charged residues improve the affinity by a combination of
favorable enthalpic contributions early in the transition state (or
even earlier in the encounter complex), and slower dissociation
rates ( k
off). We hope our study will encourage further investiga-
tions into the fundamental physicochemical basis of protein-
protein interactions.

Abstract
Effective anti-tumor immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of T cells directed 
at cancer neoantigens1, which are T cell epitopes with tumor-specific expression arising from non-
silent somatic mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not expressed in normal 
tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as 
optimal targets for an anti-tumor immune response2, their systematic discovery and evaluation 
only became feasible with the recent availability of massively-parallel sequencing for detection of 
all coding mutations within tumors, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those 
mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous HLA molecules. We hypothesized that 
vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T cell populations 
and induce a broader repertoire of new T cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-
tumoral balance in favor of enhanced tumor control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety 
and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumor neoantigens. 
Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%), 
respectively, of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients. These T cells discriminated 
mutated from wildtype antigens, and in some cases, directly recognized autologous tumor. Of 6 
vaccinated patients, 4 had no recurrence at 25 months post-vaccination, while 2 with progressive 
disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 therapy and experienced complete tumor 
regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells. These data provide a 
strong rationale for further development of this approach, alone and in combination with 
checkpoint therapies.

To generate a vaccine that targets personal neoantigens, we conducted whole-exome 
sequencing of matched tumor and normal cell DNA from individual patients, identified 
somatic mutations, orthogonally validated and assessed the expression of mutated alleles by 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the tumor, predicted which mutated peptides were likely to 
bind autologous HLA-A or HLA-B proteins of the patient, and synthesized clinical-grade 
long peptides3 targeting up to 20 neoantigens per patient, admixed with the TLR3 agonist Ott et al. Page 2

vaccine in a phase I study in patients with previously untreated high-risk melanoma (stage 
IIIB/C and IVM1a/b) following surgical resection with curative intent (Extended Data 
Tables 1, Supplementary Information 4a).
Of the 10 patients enrolled, 8 demonstrated the high mutation rate expected for melanoma, 
carried expected melanoma-associated mutations (i.e. in BRAF , NRAS  and others) and 
predominantly C →T transitions (consistent with UV exposure), and expressed multiple 
melanoma markers (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). For these 8 patients, 13–20 immunizing long 
peptides (IMP) per patient (with lengths of 15–30 amino acids) were synthesized and 
grouped into 4 separate immunizing pools (Supplementary Information 5). Six patients 
initiated vaccination (median time of 18 weeks from surgery to vaccine administration) and 
each completed the full series of 5 priming and 2 booster vaccinations. Treatment-related 
adverse events consisted of mild flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions, rash and fatigue 
(Supplementary Information 4b).
At a median follow-up of 25 months (range 20–32), 4 of 6 patients, who entered the study 
with stage IIIB/C disease, remain without disease recurrence. Two patients entered with 
previously untreated stage IVM1b disease (lung metastases); both had disease progression 
evident on restaging scans obtained after the last vaccination. Subsequently, both patients 
underwent treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab and both achieved 
complete radiographic responses (CR) after 4 doses (CR rate of pembrolizumab as first-line 
treatment for metastatic melanoma previously reported as 6.1%5), which are ongoing (Fig. 
1b, Extended Data Fig. 1d).
Overlapping 15–16mer assay peptides (‘ASP’) spanning the entirety of each IMP and 9–
10mer peptides corresponding to each predicted class I epitope (‘EPT’) were prepared and 
pooled to match the corresponding IMP pool (Fig. 2a). When measured by ex vivo  IFN-γ 
ELISPOT, we observed reactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to a 
median of 3 of 4 pools of overlapping ASP (p < 0.005), suggesting the generation of potent 
responses against multiple predicted epitopes (Fig. 2b). Ex vivo  responses to these peptide 
pools were undetectable before vaccination but were already evident at the time of earliest 
sampling, and were sustained over time. By intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), the 
majority of ex vivo  IFN-γ-positive PBMC responses against peptide pools were generated 
by CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 2a). While neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cell 
responses were not observed by IFN- γ ELISPOT nor ICS directly ex vivo , 8 of 17 (47%) 
pools of EPT across the 6 patients (at least one EPT pool/patient) stimulated detectable IFN-
γ secretion after a single round of in vitro  expansion (‘pre-stimulation’) with the peptides 
(Fig. 2d; Extended Data Fig. 3a–b). Responses against these EPT pools were absent in pre-
stimulated samples collected prior to vaccination, indicating the generation of new 
circulating CD8+ T cell responses following vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 3b). For all 
patients, >30% of neoantigen-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were polyfunctional as 
evidenced by secretion of 2–3 inflammatory cytokines (IFN- γ, TNF-α, IL-2) (Extended 
Data Fig. 2b–d, 3c–d).Ott et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptTo identify which predicted epitopes within the peptide pools stimulated the T cell 
responses, we deconvoluted all pools by either ex vivo  or pre-stimulation ELISPOT assays 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a–b, 5). Of 173 9–10mer EPT tested, derived from 91 IMP, CD8+ T 
cells were reactive against EPT from 15 (16%) immunizing peptides (2–4 immunogenic 
peptides per patient) (Extended Data Fig. 5; Supplementary Information 5). For CD4+ T cell 
responses, we tested 297 ASP across 6 patients, corresponding to 97 IMP, and detected 
responses against ASP from 19 IMP ex vivo , and an additional 39 IMP after one round of 
pre-stimulation, for a total of 58 (60%) IMP (Extended Data Fig. 5; Supplementary 
Information 6).
Thirty-four T cell lines with reactivity against each of the ex vivo  CD4+-defined and pre-
stimulated CD8+ targets were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity by incubation with 
CD4+/CD8+-depleted PBMC loaded exogenously with mutated or, for single amino acid 
changes, wildtype peptides over a range of concentrations. In 24 (86%) of 28 T cell lines 
with reactivity against a mutated peptide, we confirmed preferential reactivity of the mutated 
compared to the corresponding wildtype peptide (Fig. 3a; Extended Data Fig. 4c). For 
several predicted epitopes, reactive T cell populations were observed at peptide 
concentrations as low as ~10 pM (e.g. CD4+ T cell response against mutated RUSC2 
[Patient 1]; CD8+ T cell response against mutated COL22A1  [Patient 5]), potentially 
enabling recognition of tumor cells presenting few peptide:MHC complexes6. These data 
demonstrate the high level of specificity for neoantigens over corresponding wildtype 
antigens. Of the 6 T cell lines directed against epitopes predicted to arise from novel open 
reading frames (neoORFs), several were found highly avid for these epitopes (e.g. CD4+ T 
cell responses against the CASP5  neoORF [Patient 1]). Neoantigen-reactive CD4+ 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a) and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3b) were not detected in samples prior to 
vaccination, even after one round of pre-stimulation. Notably, 10% of IMP elicited both 
CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses.
We used multiple approaches to confirm that the detected T cell responses were directed 
against endogenously processed and presented neoantigens. First, we observed recognition 
by neoantigen-reactive CD4+ (14 of 19 [73%]) and CD8+ (15 of 15 [100%]) T cell lines of 
autologous antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing tandem minigenes encoding a series 
of 25-mer peptides (and hence requiring processing for presentation; Methods ) spanning the 
predicted mutated sites, but not of APCs expressing minigenes encoding corresponding 
wildtype peptides (Fig. 3c; Extended Data Fig. 6b). Two of 15 CD8+ T cell lines with clear 
differential reactivity to mutated vs wildtype peptide-encoding minigenes were unable to 
discriminate between cells loaded with mutated versus wildtype peptides (Fig. 3a; to VPS16 
[Patient 3] and FAM200A  [Patient 5]), suggesting that endogenous processing, but not 
exogenous loading, differs for the mutated and cognate wildtype peptides. For the CD8+ T 
cell lines, all mutated minigene responses were uniformly blocked by an anti-HLA class I 
blocking antibody (Extended Data Fig. 6b). For the CD4+ T cell lines, 10 of 19 (52%) were 
blocked by an anti-HLA-DR blocking antibody; the remainder are presumably restricted by 
other class II alleles. We observed evidence of cytolytic capacity of these T cell lines since 
elevated CD107 αβ expression was detected following exposure to APCs presenting the 
mutated minigenes for both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c).Ott et al. Page 4
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 January 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptNeoantigen-specific T cells were also tested for reactivity against autologous melanoma cell 
lines. Flow cytometric analysis of the tumor lines demonstrated variable levels of HLA class 
I and II expression (Extended Data Fig. 7a). None of the neoantigen-specific T cells 
recognized cultured tumor cell lines from Patients 1, 3, 4, and 5. For Patients 2 and 6, we 
detected recognition of autologous tumor by multiple neoantigen-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells (Fig. 3d–e). Additionally, CD4+ T cells from Patient 5 were reactive against autologous 
dendritic cells exposed to irradiated autologous melanoma cells, demonstrating that tumor-
expressed melanoma neoepitopes can be naturally presented by patient APCs (Fig. 3f). Of 
note, immunohistochemical evaluation of HLA class I and II expression of the originally 
surgically resected metastatic tumors, available for 5 of 6 patients, demonstrated detectable 
class I expression in 4 of 5 tumors (Patients 2, 4, 5, 6) (Extended Data Fig. 7b–c), and hence, 
these tumors have the potential to be recognized by neoantigen-specific T cells in vivo .
To analyze the frequency and phenotype of vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells, we generated 
HLA class II tetramers that detect neoantigen-reactive CD4+ cells. The tetramers detected T 
cells against RUSC2  (Patient 1) and ARHGAP29  (Patient 4) directly ex vivo  at week 16, 
representing ~0.03–0.06% of all circulating CD4+ cells, with persistence of ARHGAP29 -
reactive cells at week 24 (Fig. 4a–b, Extended Data Fig. 8c–d, Extended Data Table 2). To 
characterize the functional state of these cells, we sorted CD4+ T cells prior to vaccination 
and tetramer-positive CD4+ T cells after vaccination in both patients, and compared their 
gene expression profiles using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Clustering of T 
cells showed robust separation of pre- and post-vaccination cells (Fig. 4b; Extended Data 
Fig. 8d), with hundreds of genes changing their expression after vaccination. These major 
shifts in gene expression reflect a transition from naïve to effector and memory functions, 
including silencing of genes that promote naïve T cell homeostatic survival (e.g., IL7R 
[Patient 4]) and fate (e.g., FOXP1 [Patient 1]), and upregulation of genes involved in Th1 
fate (e.g., TBX21/T-bet [Patient 4]) and energy metabolism that is critical for cell 
proliferation and growth (e.g., glucose and glutamine transporters and MTOR in Patient 4) 
(Supplementary Information 7). While SATB1, a recently described epigenetic repressor of 
PD-17, was downregulated in both patients, PD-1 itself was only upregulated in Patient 4, 
suggesting additional mechanisms regulating PD-1.
For Patients 2 and 6, who both achieved a CR after treatment with pembrolizumab, we tested 
samples collected after 9–12 months of pembrolizumab treatment for reactivity against ASP 
and EPT by IFN- γ ELISPOT. Indeed, CD4+ T cell responses against 25 of 49 ASP (with 4 
novel responses) and CD8+ T cell responses against 2 of 18 EPT for Patient 2 were detected 
(Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 8a). Similarly, for Patient 6, CD4+ T cell responses were 
detected against 15 of 61 ASP (with 2 novel responses) and CD8+ T cell responses against 4 
of 32 EPT (with 2 novel responses). Thus, we observe persistence of the vaccine-induced 
neoantigen responses over time and broadening of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T 
cells following checkpoint blockade therapy.
Our study provides proof-of-principle that a personal vaccine can be produced and 
administered to a patient to generate highly specific immune responses against that 
individual’s tumor. Given the importance of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in mediating 
tumor cell killing,8,9 the vaccine, by utilizing long peptides, was designed to activate both Ott et al. Page 5
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 January 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscripttypes of T cells. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against a substantial proportion of 
IMP were detected (summarized in Extended Data Fig. 8b). Notably, 20% of IMP induced 
ex vivo  CD4+ T cell responses, comparable to the magnitude of responses seen for viral E6 
and E7 long peptide therapeutic vaccines in patients with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia3. 
Importantly, the proportion of tumor neoantigens inducing a T cell response following 
vaccination was substantially higher compared to the rates (~1% ex vivo  for CD8+ or CD4+ 
T cells) observed in patients who responded clinically to non-antigen-directed 
immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade or TIL therapy10–13. Thus, in agreement with 
a reported study showing responses to a DC-based neoantigen vaccine14, our results 
demonstrate that a personal neoantigen vaccine broadens the repertoire of neoantigen-
specific T cells substantially beyond what is induced by existing immunotherapeutics.
Despite the selection of neoantigens based on predicted presentation by HLA class I, the 
proportion of neoantigens stimulating class II responses was higher than for class I 
responses (~60% vs. 20%). Nevertheless, this outcome is consistent with recent reports in 
cancer mouse models demonstrating predominantly CD4+ responses upon vaccination with 
neoepitopes predicted by class I binding algorithms15,16. A combination of structural 
(precise N- and C-termini for class I epitopes vs promiscuous binding properties of peptides 
to MHC class II proteins17–19), cellular (scarcity of MHC class I cross-presenting CLEC9A+ 
dendritic cells cells20), and other factors likely explain the predominance of CD4+ T cell 
responses. Recent studies have highlighted a role for neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cell 
responses in direct tumor clearance8,9,15. Hence, in addition to the licensing of dendritic 
cells and the activation and maintenance of a tumor-directed CD8+ T cell response21, CD4+ 
T cells can exert direct anti-tumor effects independent of CD8+ T cells21–23.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that a personal neoantigen vaccine is safe, feasible and 
capable of eliciting strong T cell responses in a clinical setting unconfounded by prior or 
intercurrent therapy. The use of a personal neoantigen vaccine is anticipated to help 
overcome two major barriers to effective cancer therapy: tumor heterogeneity and selective 
targeting of tumor relative to healthy tissues. Based on the observed induction of de novo  T 
cell clones that detect multiple individual-specific neoantigens and recognize endogenously 
processed antigens and autologous tumors cells, our vaccine is likely to target a diversity of 
malignant clones per patient, thus addressing tumor heterogeneity as well as minimizing the 
chance of tumor escape by loss of antigen. Future neoantigen vaccine trials will take 
advantage of improved methods for predicting antigen presentation to increase the fraction 
of neoantigens inducing tumor-reactive T cells24 and will test for synergy with checkpoint 
blockade and other immunotherapeutics.
Methods
Study design
Patients with high-risk melanoma were provided informed consent and enrolled between 
April 2014 and October 2015 to a single center, phase I clinical trial approved by the Dana-
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) (NCT01970358). This 
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Key eligibility criteria 
were clinically or radiographically evident, pathologically confirmed stage IIIB/C and Ott et al. Page 6
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 January 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIVM1a/b melanoma deemed amenable to complete surgical resection and an ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1. Other requirements included absolute lymphocyte count of ≥ 
800/mcL, absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 1,500/mcL, hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL, platelet count ≥ 
100,000/mcL, aminotransferases ≤ 2×upper limit of the normal range, total serum bilirubin ≤ 
1×upper limit of the normal range and serum creatinine ≤ 1.5×upper limit of the normal 
range. Patients with uveal or mucosal melanoma, prior immune modulating or other cancer 
directed therapies (except for IFN- α given as systemic adjuvant therapy for a prior 
melanoma or melanoma recurrence), active autoimmune disease or an immunosuppressive 
condition were excluded.
The primary endpoints of the study were safety and feasibility; secondary endpoints were 
induction of tumor- and neoantigen-specific cellular immune responses and the number of 
patients alive at 2 years after melanoma resection. A personalized neoantigen-targeting 
vaccine consisting of long peptides combined into 4 distinct immunizing peptide pools with 
0.3mg of each peptide admixed with 0.5mg poly-ICLC per pool in a volume of 1ml was 
generated as described below, and was administered subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, 15, 
and 22 (priming phase) and weeks 12 and 20 (booster phase). Each of the 4 neoantigen 
vaccine pools per patient was assigned to one of four “non-rotating” extremities (or the left 
or right midriff as an alternate anatomical location) for each injection.
Clinical assessments
The safety of study treatment was assessed based on the occurrence of adverse events, which 
were categorized and graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). During the treatment phase, safety 
assessments were performed on the day of vaccination and one week after each vaccination. 
During the follow up phase, safety assessments were conducted every 3 months. 
Surveillance scans (computer tomography or combined position emission tomography/
computer tomography) were performed every 6 months; standard RECIST 1.1 criteria were 
used for assessment of disease recurrence.
Patient samples
Heparinized blood and serum samples were obtained from study subjects on IRB-approved 
protocols at the DFCI. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated 
by Ficoll/Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation (GE healthcare) and cryopreserved with 
10% dimethylsulfoxide in FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells and serum from patients were stored 
in vapor-phase liquid nitrogen until the time of analysis. HLA class I and class II molecular 
typings were determined by PCR-rSSO (reverse sequence specific oligonucleotide probe), 
with ambiguities resolved by PCR-SSP (sequence specific primer) techniques (One Lambda 
Inc.).
Patient tumor samples were obtained immediately following surgery. A portion of the 
sample was removed for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE). The remainder of 
the tissue was carefully minced manually, suspended in a solution of collagenase D 
(200unit/mL) and DNAse I (20unit/ml) (Roche Life Sciences), transferred to a sealable 
plastic bag and incubated with regular agitation in a Seward Stomacher Lab Blender for 30 – Ott et al. Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript60min. After digestion, any remaining clumps were removed and the single cell suspension 
was recovered, washed and immediately frozen in aliquots and stored in vapor-phase liquid 
nitrogen. For Patients 1, 2, 3 5, 7, 9, and 10, the frozen tumor cell suspensions were used for 
whole-exome (WES) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). For Patients 4, 6, 8 and 10 WES and 
RNA-Seq were performed on scrolls from the FFPE tissue (Supplementary Information 
1a,b).
Generation of personal neoantigen vaccines
Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES)— CLIA-certified WES was conducted by the 
Clinical Research Sequencing Platform, Broad Institute; CLIA #:22D2055652. Library 
construction from surgical melanoma specimens and matched germline DNA of all 10 
patients was performed as previously described25. Genomic DNA was sheared, end repaired, 
ligated with barcoded Illumina sequencing adapters, amplified, and size selected. For 
Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9, whole exome capture was performed using the Agilent 
SureSelect Human All Exon 44Mb v2.0 bait set (Agilent Technologies)26. For Patients 5, 6, 
8, and 10, WES was performed using the Illumina Nextera Rapid Capture Exome v1.2 bait 
set. The Illumina exome specifically targets approximately 37.7Mb of mainly exonic regions 
made up of all targets from the Agilent exome design (Agilent SureSelect All Exon V2), all 
coding regions of Gencode V11 genes, and all coding regions of RefSeq gene and 
KnownGene tracks from the UCSC genome browser ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ). Resulting 
libraries were then qPCR quantified, pooled, and sequenced with 76 base paired-end reads 
using HiSeq 2000 or 2500 sequencers (Illumina). Pooled libraries were normalized to 2nM 
and denatured using 0.2 N NaOH prior to sequencing. Data were analyzed using the Broad 
Picard Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing, duplicate marking, and data aggregation.
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)— For RNA sequencing library construction, RNA was 
extracted from frozen cell suspensions (Patients 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, and 10) or FFPE samples 
(Patients 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10) using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit or Qiagen FFPE RNeasy kit, 
respectively. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA 
Library Prep Kit (for cell suspensions) or Illumina’s TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit 
(for FFPE samples). Total RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT™ RiboGreen® RNA 
Assay Kit and normalized to 5ng/µl. For Patients 1, 2, 3, 7 and 9, each sample was 
transferred into library preparation which was an automated variant of the Illumina 
TruSeq™ Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit. This method preserves strand 
orientation of the RNA transcript. It uses oligo dT beads to select mRNA from the total RNA 
sample. It is followed by heat fragmentation and cDNA synthesis from the RNA template. 
The resultant 500bp cDNA then goes through library preparation (end repair, base ‘A’ 
addition, adapter ligation, and enrichment) using Broad designed indexed adapters 
substituted in for multiplexing. For Patient 4, the mRNA enrichment step was omitted prior 
to library preparation. The resulting libraries were quantified with qPCR using the KAPA 
Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Sequencing Platforms and then pooled equimolarly. 
For Illumina Sequencing, pooled libraries were normalized to 2nM and denatured using 0.1 
N NaOH prior to sequencing. Flowcell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed 
according to the manufacturer’s protocols using either the HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq 2500. Each Ott et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptrun was a 101bp paired-end with an eight-base index barcode read. Data was analyzed using 
the Broad Picard Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation.
For Patients 5, 6, 8 and 10, a RNA transcriptome capture method was used. Using Illumina’s 
TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep kit, a stranded cDNA library was prepared from isolated 
RNA which was then hybridized to a set of DNA oligonucleotide probes to enrich the library 
for mRNA transcript fragments. The transcriptome capture targets 21,415 genes, 
representing 98.3% of the RefSeq exome (and is the same bait set as the Rapid Capture 
Exome). Flowcell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed according to the 
manufacturer’s protocols using either the HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq 2500. Each run is a 76bp 
paired-end with an eight-base index barcode read. Data was analyzed using the Broad Picard 
Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation.
DNA quality control— Standard Broad Institute protocols as previously described27,28 
were used for DNA quality control. The identities of all tumor and normal DNA samples 
were confirmed by mass spectrometric fingerprint genotyping of 95 common SNPs by 
Fluidigm Genotyping (Fluidigm). Sample contamination from foreign DNA was assessed 
using ContEst29.
Somatic mutation calling— Analyses of whole-exome sequencing data of tumor and 
matched PBMCs (as source of normal germline DNA) from the patients were used to 
identify the specific coding-sequence mutations, including single-, di- or tri-nucleotide 
variants leading to single amino acid missense mutations and small insertions/deletions. 
Output from Illumina software was processed by the “Picard” data processing pipeline to 
yield BAM files containing aligned reads (bwa version 0.5.9, to the NCBI Human Reference 
Genome Build hg19) with well-calibrated quality scores27,30. Somatic alterations were 
identified using a set of tools within the “Firehose” pipeline ( www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/
cga). Somatic single nucleotide variations (sSNVs) were detected using MuTect (Firehose 
version v13112); somatic small insertions and deletions were detected using Indelocator27 
and Strelka31. All indels were manually reviewed in integrated genome viewer (IGV)32. All 
somatic mutations, insertions and deletions were annotated using Oncotator33. The 
ABSOLUTE algorithm (v1.1) was used to calculate the purity and ploidy of the samples. 
RNA-Seq data was processed using the PRADA software34. Comparisons of gene 
expression were conducted against data from GTEx (Analysis V6, dbGaP Accession 
phs000424.v6.p1, doi: 10.1038/ng.2653) and TCGA ([Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data 
Analysis Center (2016): Firehose stddata__2016_01_28 run. Broad Institute of MIT and 
Harvard. doi:10.7908/C11G0KM9]).
Identification of target epitopes for peptide design— NetMHCpan v2.4 was used to 
identify mutation-containing epitopes that are predicted to bind to the individual patients’ 
MHC class I molecules19,35,36. Thirty peptides of 15–30 amino acids length (“long 
peptides”) from up to 30 independent mutations were selected and prioritized for peptide 
preparation. Epitopes were chosen for inclusion based on a pre-defined set of criteria in the 
following rank order:
1. NeoORFs which included predicted binding epitopesOtt et al. Page 9
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 January 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2. High predicted affinity (< 150 nM) sSNVs due to anchor residue changes
3. High affinity (<150 nM) sSNVs due to mutations in positions other than anchor 
residues
4. NeoORFs with no predicted binding epitopes
5. Lower affinity (<150 – 500 nM) versions of (2) and (3)
Mutations in oncogenes were given highest priority within each ranked group; otherwise 
epitopes were ranked by predicted mutated peptide affinity. Only sSNVs that demonstrated 
expression of the mutated allele were used. Additionally, a variety of possible biochemical 
properties (hydrophobicity, presence of multiple cysteines) which may have affected the 
synthesizability or solubility of the long peptide were considered.
Synthesis of long peptides, pooling and final vaccine preparation— GMP 
peptides were synthesized and purified (CS Bio) using standard solid-phase synthetic 
peptide chemistry and Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-
HPLC). Up to twenty peptides were formulated in an aqueous solution containing ≤4% 
DMSO in isotonic dextrose and mixed into up to 4 pools (3–5 peptides per pool, with a final 
dose of 0.3mg of each peptide per vaccine). On the day of vaccine administration, each 
peptide pool was admixed with 0.5mg poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®; Oncovir Inc.) by syringe-to-
syringe transfer at the DFCI Clinical Pharmacy.
Melanoma cell line generation
Fresh tumor cell suspensions or thawed cryopreserved cells were washed and cultured in 
tissue culture plates containing OptiMEM GlutaMax media (Gibco,Thermofisher) 
supplemented with fetal bovine serum (5%), sodium pyruvate (1mM), penicillin and 
streptomycin (100units/ml), gentamycin (50µg/ml), insulin (5µg/ml) and epidermal growth 
factor (5ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Cell cultures were dissociated and passaged using versene 
(Gibco,Thermofisher). The expanding cell lines were tested mycoplasma free and verified as 
melanoma through immunohistochemical stains using antibodies against the melanoma 
markers HMB45, MITF, MART-1, Melan-A, and S100 that were performed in the Dana-
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Specialized Histopathology Core Laboratory.
Immunohistochemical evaluation of primary melanoma cells
Dual immunohistochemical staining of the antigen presentation components: HLA class I 
(Abcam, EMR8-5, 1:6000) and HLA class II (Dako, CR3/43 M0775, 1:750) with the 
melanoma marker SOX10 (EP 268, Cell Marque, 1:1500) was performed using an 
automated staining system (Bond III, Leica Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's 
protocol, as previously described37. Semi-quantitative scoring was performed for the 
intensity of positive staining of melanoma cell membranes for the marker of interest (0, 
negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) and for the percentage of positive staining 
malignant cells (0–100%). A cumulative “H score” was obtained by multiplying intensity 
score (0–3) by the percentage of malignant cells with positive staining (0%–100%; with any 
intensity of positive staining). Stained slides were first reviewed and scored independently Ott et al. Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptby two individuals and subsequently reviewed together with a final, consensus score 
tabulated as previously described37.
Generation and detection of patient neoantigen-specific T cells
PBMCs were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with L-glutamine, nonessential 
amino acids, HEPES, β-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 
and 10% AB-positive heat-inactivated human serum (Gemini Bioproduct). For in vitro 
expansion (‘pre-stimulation’) of antigen-specific T cells, PBMCs were stimulated in 24-well 
cell culture plates at 5×106 cells per well with individual (2µg/ml) or pooled peptides (each 
at 2µg/ml) in the presence of IL-7 (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems). On day 3, low-dose IL-2 
(20U/ml; Amgen) was added. Half-medium change and supplementation of cytokines were 
performed every 3 days, as described previously38. After 10–21 days, T cell (referred to as 
‘T cell lines’) specificity was tested against peptide, minigenes or autologous tumor by 
interferon (IFN)- γ ELISPOT or CD107 αβ degranulation assay in RPMI-1640 medium 
supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS (complete RPMI). For 
deconvolution of CD8+ T cell responses, CD8+ T cells were enriched with CD8+ T cell 
Isolation Kit beads (Miltenyi Biotec) prior to plating for ELISPOT.
Antigen formats for immune monitoring
Assay (ASP) and predicted class I epitope peptides (EPT) were synthesized and lyophilized 
(from either JPT Peptide Technologies; or RS Synthesis) (>80% purity). ASP were 15–16 aa 
and overlapped by at least 11 aa, covering the IMP sequence. EPT were 9–10 aa. Peptides 
for generation of class II tetramers were synthesized to >90% purity (21st Century 
Biochemicals). Minigenes were constructed39 such that: (i) for non-synonymous mutations, 
they encoded the mutated amino acid and surrounding upstream and downstream native 
amino acids for a total length of ~25 amino acids; (ii) for frame-shift mutations, they 
encoded the entire corresponding immunizing peptide. Multiple minigenes (3–7 per 
plasmid) for a given patient were arranged in tandem without additional linker sequences 
and synthesized as a gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies). Each tandem minigene 
construct was inserted into a pcDNA3.1 vector using available EcoRI and BamHI cut sites. 
RNA was generated by in vitro  transcription (IVT) of the tandem minigene plasmids using 
the mMESSAGE mMACHINE Ultra Kit (Thermo Fisher). 20µg of the IVT RNA was 
introduced into autologous positively-selected CD19+ B cells (CD19 Microbeads, Miltenyi 
Biotec) by nucleofection using V-buffer and the X-001 program (Amaxa Cell Line 
Nucleofector Kit V , Lonza). The B cells were used within 24h of transfection. Transfection 
efficiency was typically 70–85%, based on 24h GFP expression following nucleofection 
with control IVT RNA generated using a pcDNA3.1-GFP plasmid. Tandem constructs 
containing the wildtype versions of the minigenes with non-synonymous mutations were 
also similarly designed.
In some experiments, antigen-specific T cells were tested against autologous melanoma 
cells. In other experiments, autologous irradiated melanoma cells were co-cultured with 
autologous dendritic cells (DC). Immunomagnetically isolated CD14+ cells (Human CD14 
MicroBeads; Miltenyi Biotec) were cultured in complete RPMI containing 120ng/ml GM-
CSF and 70ng/ml IL-4 at 3×106 cells/well in 6 well plate. Media was exchanged on days 3 Ott et al. Page 11

with 150Gy and cultured in serum-free RPMI overnight. DCs were cultured with/without 
melanoma cells in complete RPMI (0.25×106 DC and 0.25×106 melanoma) in a 48-well 
plate for 5h at 37°C, followed by addition of 30µg/ml poly-inosinic-poly-cytidylic acid 
(Sigma-Aldrich) to induce DC maturation. After overnight culture, DCs were harvested and 
used as antigen-presenting cells on ELISPOT assays.
IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay
IFN-γ ELISPOT assays were performed using 96-well MultiScreen Filter Plates (Millipore), 
coated with 2µg/ml anti-human IFN- γ mAb overnight (1-D1K, Mabtech). Plates were 
washed with PBS and blocked with complete RPMI before use. For pre-stimulated T cells, 
5×103 T cells and 1×104 CD8+ T cells for detection of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, 
respectively, were co-cultured with 1×104 autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-depleted 
PBMC, 8×104 B cells, 1×104 autologous tumor, or 5×103 autologous DCs, unless otherwise 
stated (Figure 3e: 2×104 CD8+ T cells plated; Figure 4c: 1×104 T cells plated). APCs were 
pulsed with peptides (2–10µg/ml) or peptides were directly added to the ELISPOT wells 
with APCs and incubated with T cells overnight in complete RPMI at 37°C. For ex vivo 
ELISPOT, 2×105 PBMC were plated with 2µg/ml peptide and incubated overnight. Plates 
were rinsed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and then 1µg/ml anti-human IFN- γ mAb 
(7-B6-1-Biotin, Mabtech) was added, followed by Streptavidin-ALP (Mabtech). After 
rinsing, SIGMA FAST 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/Nitro blue tetrazolium 
(Sigma-Aldrich) was used to develop the immunospots, and spots were imaged and 
enumerated (Cellular Technology Ltd). For some experiments, APCs were cultured on the 
ELISPOT plate with HLA blocking antibodies (10µg/ml; pan anti-DR [clone: L243] or anti-
HLA I [clone: W6/32]) for 1–2h in advance of the addition of peptides and T cells to the 
wells. Ex vivo  responses were scored positive if >55 spot forming cells (SFC) were detected 
and were at least 1.5 standard deviations (SD) over the DMSO control (> 3SD over 
background for Patients 5 and 6). For Figure 2b, for each patient, the numbers of SFC were 
regressed on assay, time, and the interaction of assay and time using repeated measures 
models with an unstructured covariance. P-values (t-test) for the comparisons of each pool 
against the mock were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to maintain an 
overall alpha of 0.05 at each time within patient.
Intracellular cytokine staining and CD107 αβ degranulation assay
For ex vivo  intracellular cytokine detection, PBMCs were stimulated with 5µg/ml peptide or 
50ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1µg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in complete RPMI 
with 10µg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C overnight. For detection of cytokines 
from pre-stimulated CD8+ T cells, 2×106 T cells were re-stimulated with 1×106 T cell-
depleted PBMCs pulsed with 5µg/ml peptide in complete RPMI with 10µg/ml brefeldin A at 
37°C for overnight. Subsequently, cells were stained with antibodies against surface markers 
for 20min at 4°C, followed by fixation with 1% formaldehyde at 4°C for 20min, and then 
stained with antibodies against cytokines in 0.5% saponin solution at 4°C for 1h to 
overnight. Anti-CD4 antibody (conjugated with PerCP-Cy5.5, clone OKT-4, eBioscience),

minigene-expressing B cells with Alexa Fluor647-conjugated CD107 α (H4A3) and 
CD107β (H4B4) antibodies (BD Biosciences) in complete RPMI for 6h at 37°C. Cells were

30min at room temperature, followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde. Flow cytometry 
analysis was performed on a BD FACSCanto II HTS instrument.
Generation of HLA-DR tetramers loaded with defined neoantigen peptides
DR1/CLIP or and DR4/CLIP complexes were expressed in stably transfected CHO cells as 
previously described40. The DR α and β chain extracellular domains carried Jun and Fos 
dimerization domains; a C-terminal BirA site was attached to the DR α chain to enable site-
specific biotinylation. The peptide binding site was occupied by a CLIP peptide that was 
linked through a thrombin-cleavable linker to the N-terminus of the mature DR β chain. DR/
CLIP complexes were purified from CHO cell supernatants by affinity chromatography 
using mAb L243 (American Type Culture Collection). Purified DR molecules were 
biotinylated with a 1:20 molar ratio of BirA:DR as described40. Prior to peptide loading, DR 
complexes were treated with thrombin for 2h to release the CLIP peptide. Peptide-exchange 
reactions were carried out with a 15-fold molar excess of dansyl-labeled peptides (21st 
Century Biochemicals) in a buffer containing 50mM sodium citrate, 1% octylglucoside, 
100mM NaCl, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail overnight at 30 °C. DR/peptide complexes 
were separated from unbound peptide using a Superose 12 HPLC gel filtration column 
(Amersham). DR molecules loaded with defined neoantigen peptides were then isolated 
using an anti-dansyl affinity column. Complexes were eluted from the column using 50mM 
CAPS, pH 11.5 and neutralized with 1M phosphate, pH 6.0. Biotinylated DR/peptide 
monomers were buffer exchanged with PBS, concentrated to >1mg/mL, and frozen in 
aliquots at −80°C. Fluorophore-labeled streptavidin (either PE or APC) was added to 
biotinylated DR/peptide monomers at a 1:4 molar ratio in four separate additions over 40min 
at room temperature.
Tetramer labeling of CD4+ T cells
Patient PBMCs that were CD4-enriched using CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) 
were stained with both APC- and PE-labeled tetramers at 20µg/mL in RPMI containing 10% 
FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2mM glutamine and 50U/mL Pen/Strep for 1h at room temperature. 
DR/CLIP tetramers were used as negative controls. The cell density during staining was 10–
20×106 cells/mL. Unbound tetramer was removed using two washes with flow staining 
buffer (PBS +2%FBS). Cells were then stained with Live/Dead Aqua (Invitrogen) for 15min 
at room temperature, following by staining with anti-CD4 (Alexa Fluor700, OKT4, 
Biolegend), anti-CD3 (BV421, UCHT1, Biolegend), and anti-CD14/CD19 (BV510) for 
20min at 4°C. Cells were washed once with PBS and analyzed on a BD Aria cell sorter.
Single cell trancriptome data generation and analysis
Single cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells prior to vaccination and of class II tetramer-
positive CD4+ T cells post-vaccination were generated using the CEL-Seq2 protocol with 
the following modifications: single cells were sorted into 0.6µL of 1% NP-40 buffer in a Ott et al. Page 13

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript384-well plate, into which 0.6µL of barcoded reverse transcriptase reaction (RT) primers and 
a mixture of dNTPs were added. The plate was incubated at 65°C for 5min, and then moved 
immediately to ice. Reverse transcription, the 2nd strand synthesis reaction and the in vitro 
transcription reaction were carried out as previously described41. Amplified RNA (aRNA) 
was fragmented at 80°C for 3min and cleaned up with RNAClean XP beads. aRNA was 
converted to cDNA using random priming, and then Illumina adaptor sequences were added 
by PCR. Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Hiseq 2500 in High Output Run 
Mode. Raw universal molecular identifier (UMI) data was first filtered to remove all UMIs 
that had less than 10 corresponding reads. All cells that had at least 200 genes with non-zero 
UMI counts and < 25% of UMIs originating from mitochondrial genes were retained for 
downstream analysis. All genes that were not detected in at least 3 cells were excluded. 
Linear (principal components) and non-linear (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding 
or t-SNE) dimensionality reduction was performed with the Seurat package42. The SCDE 
package43 was used to identify differentially expressed gene.

Assisted Design of Antibody and Protein Therapeutics (ADAPT) is an affinity maturation platform 
interleaving predictions and testing that was previously validated on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). This study expands the applicability of ADAPT to single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), a promising class 
of recombinant antibody-based biologics. As a test case, we used the camelid sdAb A26.8, a V
HH 
that binds Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) relatively weakly but displays a reasonable level of TcdA 
neutralization. ADAPT-guided A26.8 affinity maturation resulted in an improvement of one order of 
magnitude by point mutations only, reaching an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 2 nM, with 
the best binding mutants having similar or improved stabilities relative to the parent sdAb. This affinity 
improvement generated a 6-fold enhancement of efficacy at the cellular level; the A26.8 double-mutant 
T56R,T103R neutralizes TcdA cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 12 nM. The designed mutants with increased 
affinities are predicted to establish novel electrostatic interactions with the antigen. Almost full 
additivity of mutation effects is observed, except for positively charged residues introduced at adjacent 
positions. Furthermore, analysis of false-positive predictions points to general directions for improving 
the ADAPT platform. ADAPT guided the efficacy enhancement of an anti-toxin sdAb, an alternative 
therapeutic modality for C. difficile.
Biotherapeutics including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody fragments have become a significant segment  
of industrial and academic research due to their proven efficacy, safety, and manufacturability profiles1–3. Following initial  
discovery via animal immunization, display-based selection, recombinant library screening, or rational engineering,  
these molecules typically require subsequent multifaceted optimizations4. Structure-based computational approaches  
can be useful for all major aspects of this optimization phase5. Indeed, computational tools have been employed to 
help improve the binding affinity and specificity6–9, immunogenicity10,11, and developability12–14 profiles of several 
biologics. Despite some obvious successes, computational methods still face tremendous challenges in predicting 
these complex phenomena, and the accurate scoring of binding affinity remains a difficult problem15–19.
Owing to the importance of affinity maturation to biologics optimization, we have recently devised ADAPT 
(Assisted Design of Antibody and Protein Therapeutics), a platform that interleaves structure-based com-putational predictions with experimental testing in order to optimize the binding affinity of a biologic for its target
20. The strengths of the ADAPT-based affinity maturation rest on: (i) improved consensus-based affinity 
scoring21, and (ii) identifying and eliminating false-positive predictions by experimental testing of top-scored 
mutants. Importantly, the ADAPT affinity maturation platform is designed to preserve the folding stability of

SCieNTifiC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:2260  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20599-4the parent biologic molecule. A current requirement for ADAPT is the availability of 3-D structural data for 
the protein-protein interface subjected to affinity optimization. Until now, ADAPT affinity maturation has led to 30–100-fold improvements for the binding affinities of several Fab fragments of mAbs that originally bound their antigens with 50 nM–50 pM affinities
20. However, ADAPT has not been previously utilized for affinity mat-
uration of single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), which are typically characterized by a smaller paratope due to a reduced complementarity-determining region (CDR) relative to conventional mAbs
22,23. On one hand, smaller 
antibody-antigen interfaces could lead to weaker binding affinities for sdAbs relative to mAbs, highlighting a need for sdAb affinity maturation (although sdAbs with picomolar antigen-binding affinities have been reported). On the other hand, it is unclear whether the relatively small sdAb paratope can still afford sufficient improvements in binding affinities via the ADAPT platform.
In this study, we examined the applicability of the ADAPT platform to sdAb affinity maturation while con-
tinuing our efforts towards improved therapies for Clostridium difficile  infections (CDI). Treatment of CDI with 
antibiotics can result in recurrent forms of this highly common and costly hospital-acquired disease
24–26. With 
the emergence of antibiotic-resistant and hypervirulent C. difficile strains, CDI-associated health-care costs and morbidity rates have prompted alternative treatment modalities including vaccines, fecal transplantation, probi-otics and antibody-based immunotherapy
27. With regard to antibody-based immunotherapy, a number of mAbs 
targeting and neutralizing C. difficile virulence-factor toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB) have been discovered, with the anti-TcdB mAb bezlotoxumab recently passing a Phase III clinical trial and obtaining FDA-approval
28,29. 
SdAbs are also attractive immunotherapeutics, as they present several advantages over mAbs, primarily in terms of ability to access cryptic and concave epitopes, increased stabilities, high modularity and smaller size, thus potentially leading to excellent efficacy, pharmacokinetics and developability profiles
22,23,27,30–34.
The epitopes of several camelid sdAbs against TcdA and TcdB have been recently delineated by X-ray crystal-
lography35. One of the most interesting of these anti-toxin sdAbs is the A26.8 VHH, shown to recognize a unique 
epitope on the extreme C-terminus of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of TcdA. Although A26.8 binds to TcdA with a weaker affinity than A20.1 (another V
HH that binds TcdA at multiple epitopes non-overlapping 
with that of A26.8), A26.8 is a more potent neutralizer of TcdA than A20.136. These properties led to the selection 
of A26.8 as our candidate for ADAPT optimization with the goals of improving its TcdA binding affinity and enhancing its toxin neutralization capacity.
Methods
In silico affinity maturation. The atomic coordinates of the A26.8 VHH bound to the C-terminal portion of 
TcdA were taken from the structure of the A26.8H6-TcdA-A2 complex crystallized at pH 6.5 (PDB ID: 4NC0)35, 
and were used as a starting point for virtual affinity maturation (see also associated protein sequences and residue numbering in Supplementary Fig. S1). Two versions of the complex were prepared, differing by exclusion (prepa-ration 1) or inclusion (preparation 2) of the C-terminal G262 of TcdA and N-terminal Q1 of the V
HH, which are 
not visible in the crystal structure but may affect the calculated interactions in the complex. All TcdA amino-acid residues preceding A123, which are distant from the V
HH, and the His-tag residue H125 at the C-terminus of the 
VHH, were deleted from the crystal structure. Hydrogen atoms were added to the resulting complex and adjusted 
for maximizing H-bonding interactions. Structural refinement of the complex was then carried out by ener -
gy-minimization using the AMBER force-field37,38, with a distance-dependent dielectric and an infinite distance 
cutoff for non-bonded interactions. Non-hydrogen atoms were restrained at their crystallographic positions with harmonic force constants of 40 and 10 kcal/(mol.A
2) for the backbone and side-chain atoms, respectively.
The ADAPT platform was then used for affinity maturation20. In the first round of affinity optimization, 
single-point scanning mutagenesis simulations were carried out at several positions within the CDRs of VHH 
A26.8. We used three protocols, SIE-SCWRL39–41, FoldX42,43, and Rosetta44,45, for building the structures and 
evaluating the energies of single-point mutations to 17 other possible natural amino acids (Cys and Pro were excluded) at these positions of the parental sequence. A consensus approach over specific versions of these three protocols was applied for building and scoring the V
HH mutants. Scoring of binding affinity was mainly based 
on the average Z-score and also on the average rank score over the scores calculated with the three component energy functions, SIE
40,41, FoldX-FOLDEF42, and Rosetta-Interface44. Further technical and implementation 
details of this consensus approach and its component methods can be found in Sulea et al .21. Prior to binding 
affinity predictions, the FoldX-FOLDEF energy function42 was used to estimate the effect of substitutions on the 
internal stability of the VHH structure. Thus, mutations predicted to be destabilizing by introducing folding free 
energy changes larger than 2.71 kcal/mol (i.e., 100-fold increase of unfolding equilibrium constant) relative to 
the parental molecule were discarded from further evaluation. In the second round of optimization, double- and triple-point V
HH mutants were generated from combinations of the lead single-point mutations selected after 
experimental validation, and scored using the same computational protocol as for the single-point mutants.
Protein expression and purification.  The DNA sequences of A26.8 VHH mutants were synthesized 
commercially by Thermo-Fisher/GENEART (Regensburg, Germany), subcloned into the pSJF2H expression vector
46, with C-terminal Myc/His6 tags, and were subsequently expressed in E. coli. Briefly, 50 ng of plasmid 
DNA was added to 5 µL of Mix and Go TG1 E. coli competent cells (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions before plating onto 2 × YT/ampicillin agar plates and incubation overnight at 
32 °C. For expression, 5 mL 2 × YT cultures containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 1% (w/v) glucose were inoculated 
with single plasmid-bearing E. coli colonies and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. The next 
day, 1 mL of overnight culture was inoculated into 250 mL 2 × YT/ampicillin, 0.1% (w/v) glucose, in 500 mL 
baffled Ultra Yield flasks (Thomson Instruments Inc., Oceanside, CA) with air top seals and grown until an OD
600 ~ 0.5–0.8. Cultures were then induced with 200  mM IPTG and grown overnight at 37  °C with shaking at 
220 rpm. Periplasmic-targeted VHHs were extracted by osmotic shock and supernatants filtered through 0.22 µM www.nature.com/scientificreports/3

raphy (IMAC) using Ni SepharoseTM excel affinity resin (GE Healthcare, Mississauga, ON, Canada) in binding 
buffer containing PBS pH 7.4, 400 mM NaCl, and eluted in buffer containing PBS pH 7.4, 400 mM NaCl, 250 mM 
imidazole.
Binding affinity measurements.  Before surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding experiments, 
IMAC-purified VHHs were subjected to de-salting and further purification by size-exclusion chromatography 
(SEC). Approximately 500 µg of each VHH was injected over a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL SEC column (GE 
Healthcare) in Biacore running buffer HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% 
(v/v) P20; GE Healthcare) under the control of an ÄKTA FPLC at 0.8 mL/min. Monomeric VHH fractions were 
collected and analyzed for binding to TcdA using a Biacore 3000 SPR instrument (GE Healthcare). Approximately 
4,500 resonance units (RUs) of TcdA (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using the conditions previously described
36. HBS-EP running buffer was used for all 
binding studies and regeneration of TcdA surfaces. Next, various dilution ranges of VHHs (as low as 10–0.5 nM to 
as high as 5 µM–50 nM) were injected over immobilized TcdA at a flow rate of 40 µL/min with 120 s contact time 
and 600 s dissociation time. Reference-subtracted sensorgrams were analyzed with BIAevaluation software (GE 
Healthcare) and fit to a 1:1 binding model. In cases where rapid kon and koff rate constants were observed, equilib-
rium dissociation constants (KDs) were determined by steady-state analysis. All mutant A26.8 VHHs were run in 
duplicates and the parent A26.8 VHH in quintuplicate. The discrepancies in the kon, koff and KD values reported for 
wild-type A26.8 VHH in this study vs. our previous study36 (kon = 1.8 ×  106 vs. 1.4 × 106 M−1 s−1, koff = 3.4 ×  10−2 
vs. 1.6 × 10−2 s−1 and KD = 19 vs. 12 nM) are due to the modification to protocols and reagents used in this work.
Thermal stability measurements. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used to determine the 
melting temperatures (Tm) of the parental and mutant A26.8 variants. DSF was carried out in a Rotor-Gene 6000 
real-time PCR instrument (Corbett Life Science, Mortlake, NSW , Australia). Samples were diluted in HyClone ™ 
Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS; GE Healthcare) at a final concentration, after mixing, of 0.33 mg/
mL. A total volume of 30 μL in 0.2 mL thin wall PCR tubes (Axygen, Oneonta, NY) was used. SYPRO ® Orange 
(Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) was diluted 1,000-fold from the 5,000x concentrated stock to the working dye solution in D-PBS and 15 μL were added to 15 μL of sample just prior to the experiment. Thermal 
denaturation was carried out by increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 94 °C at a rate of 0.06 °C/s. Fluorescence 
intensity, with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 610 nm, was collected at 1 °C intervals and analyzed with the 
Rotor Gene 6000 series software v1.7 (Corbett Life Science). The T
m values were determined from the peak of the 
first derivative transformation of the raw data. Each sample was measured in quadruplicate.
Toxin A inhibition assays. Vero cells (CCL-81; ATCC, Manassas, V A) were maintained in complete media 
(MEM + antibiotic/antimycotic +  10% FBS) in T-75 flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For TcdA inhibition assays, sterile 
96-well tissue culture plates (Thermo-Fisher, Ottawa, ON, Canada) were seeded with ~2 × 104 cells/well in a total 
volume of 200  µL of complete media. Plates were incubated for 24  h at 37  °C, 5% CO2. Media was then carefully 
removed from each well and replaced with 200 µL of fresh media, 20 µL of antibody (serially diluted in sterile PBS, 
giving final in-well concentrations ranging from 1 µM to 1.95 nM) and 10 µL of TcdA (List Biological Laboratories; 
final in-well concentration of 10 ng/mL corresponding to 32.5 pM) for all wells. This concentration of TcdA was 
10-fold lower than that used on in our earlier work36 and reflects the differences in TcdA potency among suppliers 
and the increased sensitivity of Vero cells to TcdA relative to human fibroblast cells (data not shown). Control wells received 20 µL of PBS instead of antibody, or 10 µL of PBS instead of TcdA. Plates were then incubated at 
37 °C and 5% CO
2 for 72 h. Next, the media was removed and replaced with 100 µL of pre-warmed MEM con-
taining 10% WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (Roche, Laval, QC, Canada). Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% 
CO2 for 1 h before reading the absorbance at 450 nm using a MultiskanTM FC photometer (Thermo-Fisher). Data 
were analyzed for % inhibition of TcdA (relative to untreated control wells) and graphed using GraphPad Prism software. The reported values are mean TcdA inhibition derived from four independent assays.
Results
First ADAPT cycle–single-point mutants. In the first round of ADAPT, 427 single-point mutations to all 
natural amino acids except Cys and Pro were computationally evaluated in the CDRs of VHH A26.8. The scanned 
region covered 25 positions (S30-P33 from CDR1, V50-Y59 from CDR2, and S100-E110 from CDR3) that when substituted have the potential to alter the antigen-binding affinity. The proximity of the targeted residues to the TcdA fragment can be seen in Fig.  1a.
The selection of the most likely single-point mutants with improved antigen-binding affinities was primarily 
guided by the top 50 consensus Z-scores based on predictions from the three computational methods within ADAPT. These cover 13 positions and show only minor differences between the results obtained with the two structural preparations described in the Methods section (Table  1 versus Supplementary Table S1). Additional 
information was gleaned from the top 50 single-point mutations sorted by the average rank of the three compo-nent methods of ADAPT. Although these largely overlap with the mutations ranked by the consensus Z-score, there are several differences with the notable addition of 2 new positions (T58 and N109) (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Visual examination of the molecular interactions predicted with the three sampling protocols of ADAPT (SCWRL, Rosetta, FoldX) was used to detect sub-optimal complementarity at the antibody-interface (e.g., burial of polar groups in non-polar environments), steric overcrowding and distortions in covalent geom -
etry (e.g., deviations from planarity of aromatic rings). This qualitative process narrowed down the selection to a set of 22 single-point mutations at 11 positions for further evaluation. These point mutations can be classified in two groups according to their location relative to the antigen and the interaction type (Table  2). The “Contact” www.nature.com/scientificreports/4
SCieNTifiC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:2260  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20599-4set includes 15 substitutions at 6 positions contributing to the main contact surface interacting with the antigen, 
whereas the 7 mutations forming the “Peripheral” set substitute 5 positions located more at the periphery of the antibody-antigen interface (Fig.  1b). The mutation T103M was not listed in the top-50 mutations by either the 
consensus Z-score or average rank, but was selected based on a favorable FoldX binding affinity score and the prediction of good structural complementarity to the antigen surface.
These 22 single-point mutants were then produced and tested comparatively with the parental 26.8 V
HH. The 
KDs and kinetic constants (kon and koff) measured by SPR are listed in Table  3. Improvements in binding affinities 
relative to the parent A26.8 VHH are presented in Fig.  2. Almost half of the single-point mutants demonstrate 
improved binding affinities, with two mutants (T56R and T103R) showing about a 3-fold improvement, and another two (Q101K and T103K) over 2-fold. The location of these mutations relative to the antigen epitope is illustrated in Fig.  1c. Substitution of T103 with the hydrophobic residues Met and Trp led to smaller improve -
ments than with Arg and Lys. Similarly, a smaller improvement was obtained by substituting T56 with Ile rather 
than Arg. Mutations T58K and N109R, considered based on their average rank scores, only marginally improved 
antigen binding. The same marginal improvement was also observed for the T54R mutation; however, T54 sub-stitution with aromatic amino acids decreased affinity. Mutations that were predicted to improve antigen-binding affinity but had the opposite effect included mutations at positions D107 and E110 (up to 2.5-fold decrease in affinity), at S53 and R104 (about 10-fold decrease in affinity) and at Q106 (30–300-fold decrease in affinity).

SCieNTifiC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:2260  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20599-4In this first ADAPT round consisting of single-point mutants, there was no clear trend as to whether koff or 
kon was more affected by the mutations. For example, in the case of the best two single-point mutants, T103R 
seems to benefit from an improvement in koff whereas T56R from an improvement in kon (about 2.5-fold relative 
to the parent in each case). Importantly, most of the first-round single-mutants had thermal stabilities similar 
to the parental A26.8 VHH with a Tm of about 78 °C (Table  3). This was expected since the FoldX stability scores 
were used to filter out mutations predicted to be significantly destabilizing. Mutations Q101K, T103R and those at position 106 had a stabilizing effect relative to the wild-type (Supplementary Fig. S2). The most destabilizing effect was observed for the D107R mutant; however its T
m still remained above 70 °C.
Second ADAPT cycle–double and triple mutants.  The four lead single-point mutations from round 
1, possessing greater than 2-fold improvements in KDs, were carried forward to round 2 of affinity maturation. 
These include T56R in CDR2, and Q101K, T103R and T103K in CDR3. Combination of these mutations can lead to a total of 5 double mutants and 2 triple mutants. Because of the proximity of positions 101 and 103, that are both substituted with positively charged amino acids, we also included in this round the charge-neutral mutation T103M, which led to a slight affinity improvement in the first round, hence adding 2 double and 1 triple mutants to the second set. These 10 mutants considered in the second round were first verified computationally within ADAPT, mainly for potential changes in folding stability as a result of adjacent mutations. All mutants were predicted to have either improved or similar stabilities relative to the parental V
HH. Relative changes in binding 
affinity were also calculated with the ADAPT protocols, which generally predicted additive improvements rel-ative to the component single mutations. Exceptions included the non-additivity predicted for the double- and triple-mutants that had simultaneous introduction of two basic residues in CDR3 (Q101K and T103R/K); nev-ertheless these mutations were predicted to improve affinity relative to the parent molecule. In these cases, intro-
duction of Met at position 103 was predicted to restore some additivity and hence supported its consideration for 
the second round of optimization.
Determination of the melting temperatures for the 10 double and triple mutants indicates that 7 have 
increased stabilities, 2 have similar stabilities and one has a slightly decreased stability relative to parental A26.8 (Table  3, Supplementary Fig. S2). The increase in thermal stability can be associated with the presence of the 
Q101K mutation, consistent with the ~3 °C increase in T
m seen for this single-point mutant.
The antigen binding kinetic and affinity constant data determined by SPR measurements are presented in 
Table  3 and Fig.  2. All 10 multiple mutants show improved binding affinities relative to the parent A26.8 VHH anti -
body, and 8 of them also show affinity improvements relative to the best single-point mutant, T103R. However, it should be noted that the second cycle of ADAPT did not afford further improvements in the dissociation rate Residue R K Q N S T H W Y F M L I V A G E D

the two best single mutations, which occur in CDR2 and CDR3. The 8-fold affinity improvement comes from an 
over 4-fold increase in kon coupled with a small 1.8-fold decrease in koff, relative to the parent A26.8 VHH. The 
improvement in binding affinity does not come at the cost of stability. The best mutant tested (T56R, Q101K, T103R) is a triple mutant that incorporates the beneficial Q101K mutation into the best double mutant. This leads to an overall 10-fold improvement of K
D, with an ~7-fold effect attributed to the change in kon, as well as a 3.4  °C 
increase in Tm relative to the original VHH A26.8. Examples of SPR sensorgrams are shown in Fig.  3 for the best 
double and triple mutants comparatively to those of the component single mutants and the parent molecule, vis-ually illustrating changes in the kinetic behavior that are favorable to the mutants. Not only are the best multiple mutants composed of the best single mutants, but there is also a generally robust additivity of mutation effects on binding affinity throughout the entire data set (Supplementary Fig. S3).
In vitro toxin neutralization by lead variants.  The antigen-binding affinity improvements obtained at 
the end of the second cycle of ADAPT prompted us to test the best binders for TcdA neutralization at the cellular level. TcdA-induced Vero cell cytotoxicity data as a function of V
HH concentration are shown in Fig.  4. It is clear 
that the best affinity-matured variants (double mutant T56R, T103R and triple mutant T56R, Q101K, T103R) have an increased protective effect against C. difficile TcdA relative to the parent V
HH. In this assay, both mutants 
show about the same TcdA IC50 of ~12 nM versus ~70 nM for the parent A26.8 VHH, a 6-fold increase in neutrali-
zation potency. It is also interesting to note that the affinity-matured variants can reach maximal TcdA inhibition levels around 70% (at 60 nM V
HH), whereas the parent VHH can only reach ~60% and that at a much higher con-
centration (500  nM). As a negative control, we also tested one of the single-point mutants with reduced antigen VHH kon (106) (M−1 s−1)akoff (10−2) (s−1)aKD (nM)aTm (°C)b

demonstrate that ADAPT-guided optimization of the VHH paratope for improved antigen-binding affinity can 
translate into a marked enhancement of TcdA neutralization at the cellular level. These data also demonstrate the 
transferability of the ADAPT affinity maturation platform from mAbs/Fab fragments to sdAbs.
Discussion
With the refinement of binding affinity prediction algorithms and growth of structural data for protein-protein complexes, the rational structure-based approach is poised to become a tractable choice for affinity maturation of protein-protein interfaces. The field of affinity maturation has been traditionally dominated by established meth-ods like display-based selection and functional screening of large, random or site-directed libraries
47–49. Extensive 
use of these methods, particularly for affinity maturation of antibodies, indicates typical affinity improvements in the 10–1000-fold range. The limited number of applications of the structure-driven ADAPT platform to affin-ity maturation thus far showed a performance in the 10–100-fold range
20. ADAPT also provides a structural 
framework for rationalization of affinity improvements at the atomic level. Presently, the main limitation of the structure-driven approach rests with the need for detailed 3-D structural knowledge of the protein-protein inter -
face (preferably from a crystal structure). Improvements in protein-protein docking algorithms with optional utilization of epitope mapping constraints (e.g., from NMR experiments or mutagenesis data) give hope for elim-
inating this requirement in the future.
An important objective of this work was to explore the applicability of the ADAPT affinity maturation platform 
to sdAbs, ADAPT having been successfully applied to several mAb-antigen interfaces in earlier campaigns. Initial 
concerns were raised due to the smaller paratope of sdAbs relative to the two-chain variable domain binding site of conventional mAbs, which reduces the number of antigen contacts and limits the mutational space available for ADAPT-guided affinity maturation. The present ADAPT campaign began with an sdAb that had a relatively weak binding affinity to its antigen (K
D ≅ 20 nM). It is reasonable to expect that relatively weak antigen-binding 
affinities are not uncommon for sdAbs, in particular those isolated from synthetic/semi-synthetic and naïve sdAb libraries, although many picomolar sdAbs have been reported from immune libraries. Here, despite the reduced paratope area, ADAPT was able to guide sdAb affinity maturation to an improvement of about one order of magnitude. Thus, one finding of this study is that an sdAb paratope can afford binding affinity improvements by 
point substitutions only, i.e., no insertion/deletion required, by applying the ADAPT affinity maturation platform. 
Another finding is that this level of affinity improvement translated into significant activity enhancements at the cellular level. However, the reduced mutational space available within the CDRs of sdAbs and its impact on the extent of ADAPT affinity maturation cannot be underestimated. An illustration comes from the ADAPT affinity maturation of the engineered bH1 Fab that binds VEGF with relatively weak affinity (K
D ≅ 40 nM) similar to

SCieNTifiC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:2260  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20599-4that of the A26.8 VHH–TcdA complex20. In that system, ADAPT was able to reach over 100-fold improvement of 
binding affinity, which can at least in part be attributed to the increased mutational space available within the six 
Fab CDR loops relative to the three found in sdAbs.
One of the advantages of rational structure-guided affinity maturation is that it helps understand the struc-
tural basis for improvement of binding affinity. In Fig.  5a we display the atomic-level interactions predicted for 
triple mutant T56R,Q101K,T103R with the TcdA fragment. It can be seen that both of the main contributors to the affinity improvement, the arginines at positions 56 and 103, establish novel, relatively short-range electrostatic interactions with negatively charged groups of the antigen (D231, D244, and G262 C-terminus). The lysine at the more peripheral position 101 seems to act by neutralizing some of the negative charges on the sdAb itself (at E110 and D112 of CDR3) hence alleviating some of the long-range electrostatic repulsion to the antigen present in the parental molecule. The new intramolecular H-bond interactions introduced by Lys at position 101 (Fig.  5) are 
also likely responsible for the observed increase in stability upon the Q101K mutation (Table  3, Supplementary 
Fig. S2). The aliphatic portion of R103 may also benefit from novel short-range contacts with M229 of the antigen. As shown in the rotated view of Fig.  5b, the hydrophobic Met side chain at position 103 could still contact M229 
of the antigen, but lacks the potential of Arg or Lys for electrostatic interactions, thereby leading to a smaller improvement in binding affinity (Fig.  2, Table  3). Between the two positively charged side-chain substitutions 
at position 103, Arg is favored according to the SPR measurements, in agreement with structural predictions

SCieNTifiC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:2260  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20599-4showing that the shorter Lys side chain does not reach close enough to D231 of the antigen in order to establish 
an H-bonding interaction as in the case of R103 (Fig.  5b).
It is equally important to analyze the major false-positive predictions. They include all four hydrophobic sub-
stitutions at position Q106, as well as S53R and R104W (Fig. 2 , Table 3 ). Substitutions of Q106 with Trp, Phe, 
Tyr or Leu had the most detrimental effects on antigen binding affinity, yet their calculated consensus scores 
were reasonably high (Table  1, Supplementary Table S1) and were well-accommodated at the binding interface 
(Supplementary Fig. S4). A closer examination of the interactions established in the parent complex highlights 
the presence of water-mediated H-bond interactions between the side-chain amide moiety of Q106 and the main-chain NH group of L240 of the antigen (Supplementary Fig. S5). Explicit water-mediated interactions and the cost of displacing structured water molecules may not have been properly captured by the continuum treat -
ment applied here. This points to a possible direction towards improving the current computational protocol in ADAPT. R104W was predicted with a very favorable Z-score (Table  1, Supplementary Table S1), but was not pres -
ent in the top-50 by the average rank score (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Since this mutation was predicted as very favorable by the Rosetta method only, revisiting the ranking protocol relative to the Rosetta-Interface 
scoring function, in which the electrostatic component is significantly downscaled, may be further explored in 
the future. Qualitatively, the interactions established by W104 appear feasible, including an H-bond with the main chain carbonyl group of A237 of the antigen (Supplementary Fig. S4). The S53R mutation was predicted to be only marginally improving, based on R53 establishing H-bond interactions with E242 of the antigen differently than the parental S53 (Supplementary Fig. S4); the structural basis for its detrimental effect as measured by SPR remains elusive.
There is no requirement or guarantee for additivity of mutation effects on binding affinity; however, 
multiple-point mutants benefiting from additivity are those generally leading to the largest improvements in binding affinity. Mutation additivity of affinity improvements also serves to validate the single-mutation data and 
increases the confidence in the observed trends. In the present sdAb affinity maturation data set, the additivity 
regression slope and intercept are close to what was previously observed from the ADAPT affinity maturation of several mAbs
20. We observed that most of the additive mutations are not mutually influencing each other, which 
may have contributed to the maximal additivity obtained by combining these mutations. Mutually interacting mutations (often at adjacent 3-D positions) might reduce additivity, or even eliminate it totally to the point of decreased affinity relative to the parent, for example by steric collisions between the mutated side-chains. Within the present set of sdAb mutants, those incorporating simultaneous substitutions of the adjacent positions 101 and 
103 with positively charged amino acids benefit somewhat less from additivity (blue symbols in Supplementary 
Fig. S3) than the other multiple mutants. This partial loss of additivity was in fact expected as it was inferred at the earlier stage of computational prediction. In contrast to the strong additivity of affinity improvements, no addi-tive effects of k
off improvements were observed, and in fact the koff improvements obtained for the single mutants 
relative to the parent were small (less than 2-fold except for T103R). This led to binding affinity improvements for the multiple mutants that were largely dominated by k
on increases (Table  3). Since these mutants include substi-
tutions to charged residues, improving binding affinities via enhanced association rates is an expected behavior50. 
However, despite a relatively poor koff of the parental VHH and marginal koff improvements afforded by ADAPT,

SCieNTifiC  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:2260  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20599-4it is noteworthy that the obtained kon improvements were able to significantly enhance the inhibition potency at 
the cellular level.
The results reported here also have implications towards improved biotherapeutics against C. difficile infec-
tions. As noted earlier, sdAbs represent alternative therapeutic modalities to antibiotics that induce resistance, 
disease recurrence and incur high costs. They also have largely recognized advantages over mAbs in terms of size, 
epitope accessibility and stability. In this study, ADAPT-guided affinity maturation helped improve the potency 
of the A26.8 VHH for neutralization of C. difficile TcdA, a proven virulence factor of CDI. The observation that 
binding affinity correlated with neutralization potency lends further support to the notion that the unique A26.8 epitope located at the extreme C-terminus of TcdA-RBD is highly functional and perhaps implicated directly in toxin contacts with the host cell receptor. It should be noted that the lead A26.8 mutant was only capable of a maximum of 70% TcdA inhibition, and at an EC
50 concentration of 12  nM the VHH is present in ~400-fold molar 
excess of TcdA. Regardless, many other high-affinity sdAbs show no toxin inhibition, and other sdAbs display weaker inhibition potency despite having high valency and stronger binding affinity (e.g., the A20.1 V
HH)27,35,36. 
Because the A26.8 epitope on TcdA was shown to be non-overlapping with those of several other neutraliz-ing sdAbs, including A20.1, it is expected that combining the improved A26.8 variants reported here, e.g., the T56R,T103R double mutant, with those sdAbs will impart further increases in toxin neutralization potency, as previously shown for the parental A26.8 V
HH36.

Abstract
This investigation evaluated the utility of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model,
which incorporates model parameters representing key determinants of monoclonal antibody
(mAb) target-mediated disposition, to predict, a priori, mAb disposition in plasma and in tissues,
including tumors that express target antigens. Monte Carlo simulation techniques were employed
to predict the disposition of two mAbs, 8C2 (as a non-binding control mouse IgG1 mAb) and
T84.66 (a high-affinity murine IgG1 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen mAb), in mice bearing no
tumors, or bearing colorectal HT29 or LS174T xenografts. Model parameters were obtained or
derived from the literature. 125I-T84.66 and 125I-8C2 were administered to groups of SCID mice,
and plasma and tissue concentrations were determined via gamma counting. The PBPK model
well-predicted the experimental data. Comparisons of the population predicted versus observed
areas under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for T84.66 were 95.4 ± 67.8 versus
84.0 ± 3.0, 1,859 ± 682 versus 2,370 ± 154, and 5,930 ± 1,375 versus 5,960 ± 317 (nM × day) at
1, 10, and 25 mg/kg in LS174T xenograft-bearing SCID mice; and 215 ± 72 versus 233 ± 30,
3,070 ± 346 versus 3,120 ± 180, and 7,884 ± 714 versus 7,440 ± 626 in HT29 xenograft-bearing
mice. Model predicted versus observed 8C2 plasma AUCs were 312.4 ± 30 versus 182 ± 7.6 and
7,619 ± 738 versus 7,840 ± 24.3 (nM × day) at 1 and 25 mg/kg. High correlations were observed
between the predicted median plasma concentrations and observed median plasma concentrations
(r2 = 0.927, for all combinations of treatment, dose, and tumor model), highlighting the utility
ofthe PBPK model forthe a priori prediction of in vivo data.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptreached the market, including antibodies directed against soluble ligands associated with
tumor growth (e.g., bevacizumab), antibodies directed against cell-surface proteins
associated with hematological tumors (e.g., rituximab), and antibodies with affinity for cell
surface proteins associated with solid tumors (e.g., trastuzumab, cetuximab and
panitumumab) [1]. In addition to the mAbs that are in current clinical use, several anti-
cancer mAbs are in various stages of clinical testing [2].
Antibodies targeting solid tumors must overcome a range of well-known hurdles, including:
(a) heterogeneous vascularization and blood perfusion [3]; (b) inefficient lymphatic
drainage, which leads to elevated hydrostatic pressure in the tumor interstitium and, thus,
limits the rate of convective transport of antibodies into tumors[3, 4]; (c) the “binding site
barrier”, where high affinity antibody binding to tumor antigens concentrates antibody in
tumors to regions close to the site of antibody extravasation from tumor capillaries [5–8]; (d)
nonspecific binding to proteins within the tumor milieu [3, 9]; and (e) rapid target-mediated
mAb elimination within tumors, which acts as a sink that minimizes mAb concentrations in
tumor interstitial fluids [10, 11].
Target-mediated disposition (TMD) of antibody may lead to a particularly dramatic effect
on mAb concentrations within tumors. The influence of TMD on mAb disposition is a
function of dose, the antigen expression level, rates of antigen “shedding”, rates of antigen
internalization and turnover, rates of antibody extravasation and transport within tumors, and
rates of antibody-target association and dissociation [5, 6, 12–18]. Given the complex nature
of antibody disposition in tumors, prediction of antibody uptake and tumor distribution has
been an elusive goal.
Few mathematical models have been developed to characterize or predict the tumor
disposition kinetics of antibodies or antibody fragments [5, 13, 19]. However, there is
growing interest in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of mAb
disposition, and mechanistic PBPK models may be well-suited for incorporation of mAb-
and target-specific parameters to facilitate efforts to predict tumor distribution, including the
disposition of mAb exhibiting TMD [20–26]. For example, PBPK models of IgG organ and
tissue disposition [22] have been extended to characterize the influence of tumor-associated
target-mediated mAb elimination on the plasma, tissue, and tumor disposition of a
monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody, T84.66 [23]. However, the predictive
utility of this PBPK model, with modulation of known determinants of mAb disposition, has
not been thoroughly evaluated.
The main objectives of this study were: (i) to investigate the impact of target antigen
expression level and antibody specificity on the plasma, tissue and tumor disposition of
mAb in tumor-bearing SCID mice, (ii) to incorporate information from the literature
regarding antibody-target binding, target expression, and target-mediated antibody
catabolism, to predict the plasma, tissue, and tumor disposition of mAb, with or without
specific tumor binding, in tumor bearing-SCID mouse models, and (iii) to evaluate the
PBPK model predictions by comparison with the experimental data.
Materials and methods
Antibodies, cells and reagents
T84.66, a murine anti-carcinoembryonic antigen IgG1 mAb (anti-CEA) and 8C2, a murine
anti-topotecan IgG1 mAb, were used as model antibodies with high affinity (T84.66) or with
no specific affinity (8C2) for tumor antigens. T84.66 was produced from the culture of
hybridoma cells (HB-8747, ATCC, Manassas, VA), as described previously [23]. 8C2 was
produced and purified following established methods [27]. Two CEA-expressing humanAbuqayyas and Balthasar Page 2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptcolorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, LS174T (CL-188, ATCC) and HT29 (HB-8747,
ATCC), were employed for this work. LS174T human colon cancer cells were cultured in
Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10 % fetal
bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1 % penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen). HT29 human colon
cancer cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a modified medium (ATCC), supplemented with 10
% fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin–streptomycin. Sodium iodide (Na125I) was
obtained from Perkin Elmer Life & Analytical Sciences (Waltham, MA). Trichloroacetic
acid (TCA) was obtained from Sigma Life Science (St. Louis, MO), and Potassium iodide
(KI) was from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was
obtained from Invitrogen.
Animals
Male severe compromised immune-deficient (SCID) mice (C.B-17/IcrHsd-PrkdcSCID), 4–5
weeks of age, were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The mice were housed
individually in autoclaved filter-top cages under sterile conditions, and maintained on a 12-h
light/12-h dark cycle. Mice were fed autoclaved laboratory animal chow and water ad
libitum. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care
Committee of the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.
Development of xenograft models
Suspensions of LS174T cells (~2.0 × 106 cells/mouse) or HT29 cells (~5.0 × 106 cells/
mouse) in sterile PBS were injected subcutaneously into the left flank of SCID mice, and
tumor growth was monitored. LS174T cells have been shown to exhibit high expression of
CEA, whereas HT29 cells exhibit low-level expression of CEA. IgG was injected when
tumor size reached 200–300 mm3 as measured using a Vernier caliper. Starting 2 days prior
to injection of 125I-IgG, mice were kept on KI-autoclaved water (0.2 g/l) to block the
thyroidal uptake of free iodine.
Iodination of IgG
IgG was labeled with 125I using a modified chloramine-T method, as described previously
[22]. The purity of the iodinated IgG was assessed using thin layer chromatography (PE SiL-
G, Whatman Ltd., Kent, England). For all in vivo experiments, the purity of the iodinated
preparation was higher than 99 %.
Pharmacokinetic studies
Anti-CEA mAb (T84.66) pharmacokinetics— T84.66 pharmacokinetics were assessed
in: (i) LS174T xenograft-bearing SCID mice, (ii) in HT29-xenograft bearing SCID mice,
(iii) in non-tumor bearing (control) SCID mice. All groups of mice received T84.66 at dose
levels of 1, 10 and 25 mg/kg. Additionally, T84.66 pharmacokinetics in HT29 xenograft-
bearing mice were also investigated at 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg. In all studies, mAbs were
injected intravenously with a tracer dose (10 μCi/mouse) of 125I-labeled mAb (400 μCi/kg,
~0.03 Ci/mg specific activity of125I-T84.66 solution). The tracer comprised less than 1 % of
the total T84.66 injected dose at the 1, 10, and 25 mg/kg dose levels. For dosing of 0.025
and 0.1 mg/kg, the dosing solution was prepared with a specific activity of 0.0862 Ci/mg,
and 10 μCi of 125I-T84.66 corresponded to 28.5 or 5.98 % of the total injected dose.
8C2 pharmacokinetics— 8C2 pharmacokinetics were investigated in LS174T xenograft-
bearing SCID mice at 1 and 25 mg/kg. When tumor size reached 200–300 mm3, 8C2 was
injected intravenously in mice at the predetermined dose, with a tracer amount of 125I-8C2
(10 μCi/mouse). The amount of mAb in the tracer dose was less than ~1 % of the total
injected dose.Abuqayyas and Balthasar Page 3

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptAssessment of antibody concentration in plasma, tissue, and tumor samples
—Blood and other tissues were harvested from sub-groups of mice, at predetermined points,
up to 10 days after dosing. For T84.66 pharmacokinetic studies in HT-29 tumor bearing
mice, three mice were sacrificed at each time-point in the terminal portion of the time-course
(i.e., at 4, 7 and 10 days), while 1–3 mice were sacrificed at earlier time points (1 h–1 day).
For all other PK studies, three mice were sacrificed, from each treatment group, at each time
point. Plasma samples were separated and TCA-precipitated as described previously [28].
Radioactivity was counted using a gamma counter (LKB Wallac 1272, Wallac, Turku,
Finland). Radioactive counts from TCA-precipitated tissue and plasma samples were
corrected for background and decay, and the counts were then converted to concentration
(nM) based on the specific activity of the dosing solution. The densities of all tissues were
assumed to be 1 g/ml.
Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (NCA)— The mean areas under the
plasma or tissue concentration–time curves (AUC 0–10 days ), and the associated standard
deviations, were calculated for each mAb using the NCA for sparse samples module in
WinNonlin 6.1 (Phoenix, Pharsight Corporation, Palo Alto, CA). The sparse sampling
module calculates the standard deviation associated with AUC 0–10 days  using a modified
Bailer method [29, 30]. Plasma clearance ( CLp) and volume of distribution at steady-state
(Vss) were also determined using NCA.
Mathematical modeling
Model structure— A PBPK model evaluating the influence of the neonatal Fc receptor
(FcRn) on plasma and organ disposition of mAbs and the influence of CEA on the target-
mediated elimination of T84.66 was previously developed [23]. The intent of this work is to
evaluate the utility of the model in predicting mAb pharmacokinetics in plasma, tumors, and
in other tissues, using the published model structure, and incorporating literature-reported
values for physiological parameters that are known determinants of the TMD of antibodies.
These determinants include: antibody-target binding affinity, target expression levels, rates
of internalization of mAb-target complexes, plasma and lymphatic flow rates, and the tumor
vascular volume.
A schematic diagram of the PBPK model structure is shown in Fig. 1. The model structure
includes compartments to represent the lung, gastrointestinal tract (GI), spleen, liver, heart,
kidney, muscle, skin, lymph nodes, and tumor. Each organ was divided into vascular,
endothelial, and interstitial spaces (Fig. 1b). An additional cellular sub-compartment was
included in the tumor compartment, as described previously, to account for antibody
interaction with cellular antigens (Fig. 1c) [23]. In each tissue, the mAb enters the tissue
vascular space by plasma flow rate to that organ ( Q) and exits by a reduced flow ( Q–L)
based on the lymphatic flow associated that organ ( L). In the vascular space, the mAb is
sieved through vascular pores into the interstitial sub-compartment, via convection, as
dictated by lymph flow and the vascular reflection coefficient. Unbound mAb in the
interstitial space is sieved out of the organ by convection, based on lymphatic flow rate and
on the lymphatic reflection coefficient 
 . Unbound mAb in the interstitial space is
also allowed to enter the endosomal sub-compartment by a linear rate process (representing
fluid-phase endocytosis). Plasma flow rates into non-tumor tissues, organ volumes, organ
clearances, reflection coefficients, and FcRn-related transport parameters were obtained
from a previously published PBPK model [23]. Parameters that were used in the model are
defined in Tables 5, 6, 7 in Appendix 1, and the equations for the model are provided in
Appendix 2.Abuqayyas and Balthasar Page 4

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptTumor compartment parameters and assumptions— The published PBPK model
was shown to be most sensitive to tumor-related parameters [23], including the tumor
vasculature reflection coefficient 
 , tumor plasma flow rate ( Qtumor ), tumor lymph
flow rate ( Ltumor ), the fraction of accessible antigens ( FA), antigen concentration ([CEA]),
antibody-antigen equilibrium dissociation constant ( Kd), and the antibody-antigen
internalization rate constant ( kint). A literature survey was conducted to obtain in vitro or in
vivo estimates of these key parameters. Plasma flow rate was set based on an estimated
value in LS174T tumors using the 86Rb uptake method [20], with adjustment for the tumor
weights observed over the study period. Reported values for the tumor lymph flow rates
ranged from 0.07 to 10 % of blood flow to tumor [20, 31]. Given the high variability in
literature reported values of the tumor lymph flow rate, we fixed Ltumor  to 4 % of the tumor
plasma flow rate, as assumed previously [23]. The mean literature reported values, and the
associated standard deviations, for binding affinity, tumor antigen concentrations, and tumor
vasculature reflection coefficients are summarized in Table 1.
CEA concentrations in LS174T and HT29 tumors were based on measurements in excised
xenograft tumors or in cells grown in culture. The CEA concentration in different LS174T
or HT29 preparations varied substantially in reports from different groups, and this
variability may be related to heterogeneity in antigen expression and to assay variability [17,
21, 32–38]. The fraction of accessible antigens in xenograft tumors was fixed to 0.203 [23].
The mean CEA concentration in LS174T tumors was ~tenfold higher than the mean CEA
concentration in HT29 tumors (1,520 vs. 159 nM) (Table 1).
The rate of mAb-CEA internalization ( kint) was based on in vitro measurements of the
internalization of CEA or mAb-CEA complexes in CEA expressing cell lines. Endocytosis
half-life has been reported to be in the range of 10–16 h in LS174T spheroids [11], and 11–
17 h in other CEA expressing cell lines [11]. This internalization rate is consistent with
values reported for cell-surface CEA turnover (15 h) [11, 17].
Values for the equilibrium T84.66-CEA dissociation constant 
  were obtained via a
variety of binding analysis methods, such as surface plasmon resonance [39], and cell
binding assays with the use of radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled detection methods [40].
8C2, the anti-to-potecan mAb, was assumed to show no specific binding for CEA. LS174T
vascular volume was assumed to be 7 % of total tumor volume [20], and HT29 vascular
volume was set to 2 % of total tumor volume [41]. Tumor growth rates were determined
from the observed tumor growth, with characterization with a simple exponential growth
function.
For anti-VEGF-treated LS174T-tumors, the tumor vascular volume was reduced by 65 %
[42], and plasma and lymphatic flow rates were reduced by 50 % [43]. The tumor vascular
permeability coefficient was “normalized” to 0.95, the value used for non-tumor tissues in
the model. Anti-VEGF treatment was assumed to have no effect on CEA expression,
internalization, or on CEA-mAb binding.
PBPK model simulations
Simulations were conducted using ADAPT 5 Version 5.0.42 (University of Southern
California, BMSR, CA) to predict plasma, tumor, and tissue concentrations of mAb. The
mean parameter estimate and the variance (SD2) were used to simulate mAb concentrations,
assuming log-normal distributions for each parameter. Simulations predicted mAb
concentration versus time data for the following: (i) T84.66 administered to LS174T
xenograft-bearing SCID mice at 1, 10, and 25 mg/kg, (ii) T84.66 mAb administered to

PBPK model evaluation
The population median, 5th, and 95th percentiles of mAb concentrations in plasma, tumors,
and other tissues were calculated. The mean population AUC 0–10 days  (± SD) values for each
tissue were also predicted by the model. Observed in vivo data of antibody plasma and
tissue concentrations were compared to the prediction interval for each tissue. Additionally,
mean plasma clearance values, plasma AUCs, and tissue AUCs were calculated from
observed antibody concentration data and compared to model-predicted clearance and
AUCs. Correlation between model predicted and observed median plasma concentrations
was tested.
Results
T84.66 and 8C2 plasma pharmacokinetics
As summarized in Table 2 and depicted in Fig. 2, T84.66 exhibited rapid, nonlinear
elimination in mice with CEA-expressing tumors. For comparison of disposition across the
different groups of mice, pharmacokinetic parameters ( Vss, CL) were determined via non-
compartmental, moment analyses. It is important to note that the pharmacokinetics of
T84.66 are likely to be inconsistent with two important assumptions of moment analysis
(i.e., the assumptions of linear pharmacokinetics and the assumption that all T84.66
elimination occurs from sites that are in rapid equilibrium with plasma). Consequently,
estimated values for plasma clearance should be interpreted as concentration- and time-
averaged values, and estimates of Vss should be viewed with caution. T84.66 clearance, as
estimated by moment analyses, was fourfold to 12.7-fold higher in LS174T-bearing mice
compared to values observed for non-tumor bearing mice over the dose range of 1–25 mg/
kg. Elimination of T84.66 was 1.8–2.8-fold faster in HT29- tumor-bearing mice compared
to values in non-tumor bearing mice at 1–25 mg/kg. Evaluation of the dose normalized
profiles (Fig. 2) of T84.66 in control and HT29–SCID mice suggests linear disposition over
the 1–25 mg/kg dose range. However, nonlinear elimination was observed for T84.66 in
LS174T–SCID mice. To further evaluate T84.66 disposition in HT29 tumor-bearing mice,
additional investigations were conducted using doses of 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg. At these
doses, T84.66 was eliminated very rapidly, revealing a significant dose-dependency in
clearance (Fig. 2). The plasma pharmacokinetics of 8C2 were assessed in LS174T-bearing
SCID mice at 1 and 25 mg/kg. 8C2 exhibited bi-exponential disposition kinetics, with
slower elimination relative to T84.66 (Table 2). 8C2 disposition showed more rapid
clearance at 1 mg/kg (19.7 ml/day/kg) than at 25 mg/kg (10.6 ml/day/kg).
Tumor disposition
T84.66 and 8C2 uptake into tumors increased with increasing dose, with highest uptake
observed at 25 mg/kg. At each dose level, T84.66 tumor concentrations were higher in
LS174T versus HT29 tumors, consistent with the higher antigen expression on LS174T
cells. Following administration of mAb at 25 mg/kg, T84.66 AUC 0–10 days  was 3,610 ± 145
in LS174T and 1,765 ± 149 (nM × day) in HT29 tumors, while 8C2 AUC 0–10 days  was 2,565
± 122 (nM × day) in LS174T tumors. The ratios of tumor to plasma AUC 0–10 days , for all
groups, are summarized in Table 3.Abuqayyas and Balthasar Page 6

T84.66 pharmacokinetics in LS174T xenograft-bearing SCID mice— The PBPK
model was used to simulate plasma, tumor, and tissue concentrations of T84.66 and 8C2.
Comparison of model predictions and observed T84.66 concentrations in plasma and tissues
of LS174T-bearing mice are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. PBPK model-predicted AUCs at each
dose were comparable to observed AUCs in all tissues (Fig. 3), and Table 4 presents a
comparison of model-predicted and observed values of CL. The observed T84.66
concentration–time profiles and the model-predicted population median and associated 90 %
prediction intervals for LS174T- bearing mice are depicted in Fig. 4. As shown in the figure,
T84.66 concentrations in plasma and other tissues are in good agreement with model
predictions. At all investigated doses, the 90 % prediction intervals were relatively narrow at
early time points, and the windows widened with time after dosing, reflecting the influence
of variability in the primary determinants of mAb elimination. At higher dose levels (e.g., 25
mg/kg), where non-linear processes show a greater degree of saturation, the variability in the
predicted profiles was less profound.
T84.66 mAb PK in HT29 xenograft-bearing SCID mice— Model predictions of
T84.66 concentration–time profiles in HT29-bearing mice, at doses of 0.025–25 mg/kg, are
shown in Figs. 5 and 6. For doses of 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg, T84.66 exhibited a rapid decrease
in concentrations during the first several hours following mAb administration to HT29
xenograft-bearing mice, and this pharmacokinetic behavior was not well predicted by the
model (Figs. 5, 6a, b). Model-predicted mean clearance values of 65.1 and 55.6 ml/day/kg
under-predicted the observed clearance rates of 220 and 130 ml/day/kg at 0.025 and 0.1 mg/
kg (Table 4).
8C2 mAb PK in LS174T-bearing SCID mice— Unexpectedly, 8C2 demonstrated dose-
dependent pharmacokinetics in the LS174T tumor model, with more rapid elimination at 1
versus 25 mg/kg. The relatively rapid elimination of 8C2 at 1 mg/kg was not predicted by
the model (Figs. 7, 8). Interestingly, the observed clearance of 8C2, 19.7 ml/day/kg at 1 mg/
kg and 10.6 ml/day/kg at 25 mg/kg, exceeded the observed clearance of T84.66 in control
mice (6.2 and 6.6 ml/day/kg at 1 and 25 mg/kg) (Table 2). The observed rapid distribution of
8C2 in GI and heart, and the slower distribution in muscle and skin, were not well-predicted
by the model. Nonetheless, the model captured 8C2 uptake and elimination in tumors fairly
well, and observed tumor concentrations of 8C2 were within the 90 % confidence interval at
all investigated time points.
T84.66 PK in anti-VEGF treated LS174T xenograft-bearing SCID mice— In
general, model predictions were in very good agreement with observed data (Figs. 9, 10).
Reducing blood and lymphatic flow to the tumor, and reducing tumor vascular volume, led
to predictions for decreased tumor uptake of T84.66 in the tumor, and the model predicted
T84.66 plasma and tissues concentration versus time profiles quite well.
There was a high correlation between the predicted population median concentrations and
the observed median plasma concentration. The correlation coefficient ( r2) value of 0.927
indicates good agreement between model predicted values and observed data, at all-time
points, and for all simulation scenarios.
Discussion
This study evaluated the ability of a PBPK model to predict the plasma, tumor, and tissue
concentration versus time profiles for monoclonal antibodies, with or without specific tumor
binding, in mouse models. Experimental work was conducted with two different monoclonalAbuqayyas and Balthasar Page 7

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptantibodies (8C2 and T84.66), in two tumor models (LS174T and HT29) and in non-tumor
bearing control mice, with co-administration of bevacizumab (to modulate tumor
vascularization and blood flow), and at doses ranging from 0.025 to 25 mg/kg. Under these
conditions, time-averaged estimates for plasma clearance of the mAb ranged from 5.5 to 220
ml/day/kg and time-averaged tumor-to-plasma exposure ratios ranged from 0.18 to 1.33.
The simulation work employed a previously published PBPK model, which had been shown
to allow accurate characterization of the dose-dependent plasma pharmacokinetics of an
anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody, T84.66, in mice bearing LS174T xenografts [23].
For this study, literature reports were reviewed to obtain, or to allow derivation of, key
parameters associated with the TMD of mAb, including antigen density for two different
tumor models, antibody-antigen internalization rate constants, antibody-antigen affinity,
tumor vascular reflection coefficients, and tumor blood flow rates. In general, the model
provided very good, a priori predictions of mAb exposure in plasma, tumor, and in non-
tumor tissues. Discussed below are the main assumptions of the model and of the parameter
estimates, followed by discussion of the results and the implications of this work.
In several instances, the literature data used to estimate model parameters were associated
with substantial uncertainty, and some simplifying assumptions were made. For example,
reflection coefficients have not been directly measured for healthy tissues or for tumor
samples. Literature reports indicate that tumor vessels are leakier in comparison to other
organs, hence 
  is anticipated to be smaller than the reflection coefficient that has been
assumed for healthy organs (0.95). Reported values for the reflection coefficient in tumor
blood vessels have been based on model fittings or from investigations conducted in vitro
[23, 44]. Based on the reported values, which are viewed with relatively low confidence, a
mean value of 0.734 ± 0.189 (25 % variability) was used in this work. For animals treated
with bevacizumab, 
  was assumed to “normalize” to 0.95. This normalization is
consistent with the role played by VEGF in tumor vascular permeability [45], and with
reports that indicate that the tumor vasculature is less permeable following treatment with
anti-VEGF [46, 47]. Lymphatic capillaries, including tumor lymphatic capillaries, are
expected to be quite porous and, consequently, the reflection coefficient for lymph
capillaries was set at 0.2, as used in prior publications [22,23, 26]. As a result of the
structure of our model, which is consistent with the majority of models that describe
convective transport of macromolecules in tissues [20–26], mass transfer by convection is
relatively insensitive to changes in the lymphatic reflection coefficient (i.e., as mass transfer
is dependent on L × [1–σ] × C , and when σ is small, relatively large changes are required to
influence mass transfer rates). Due to expectations for low sensitivity to the lymphatic
reflection coefficient, and due to a lack of experimentally determined values, the lymphatic
reflection coefficient was assumed to be the same in tumors and in healthy tissues.
Vastly different values for the lymphatic flow rate in tumors have been reported, ranging
from 0.07 to 10.2 % of tumor plasma flow rate [20, 31]. Given the large variability in this
value, and to minimize the impact of uncertainty in lymph flow rates in the population
simulations, we assumed a median value of 4 % of plasma flow, as applied previously [23].
The poorly controlled growth of solid tumors is expected to lead to a decrease in tissue
compliance and, potentially, to a collapse of lymphatic vessels within tumors [48]. This then
leads to increased hydrostatic pressure in the tumor interstitial space, and to decreases in the
rate of fluid entry into the tumor interstitial space. Dramatic reduction in the rate of lymph
flow from tumors ( L) may occur, resulting in substantial decreases in the mass transfer of
macromolecules via convection ( L × [1–σ] × C) . The increased porosity of blood capillaries,
in combination with decreased rates of lymph flow, is thought to be responsible for the
“enhanced permeability and retention effect” for macromolecules within solid tumors [49].
The present PBPK model assumes that lymph flow is a fixed fraction of plasma flow,Abuqayyas and Balthasar Page 8
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 December 01.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptindependent of tumor size. This assumption may be valid for relatively small tumors, such
as those evaluated in this study. However, it is important to note that the simple structure of
our PBPK model may be inappropriate for predicting mAb distribution within large tumors,
where there is an increased likelihood for dramatic changes in tumor hydrostatic pressure
gradients and lymph flow.
Tumor growth rate was expressed as exponential function of time over the study period,
where the total tumor volume at any time point was defined as:
, for LS174T tumors, and
 for HT29 tumors. In these equations,
 and Vtumor (0) represent the total and initumor volumes. The LS174T growth rate in
the current investigation was similar to, but slightly faster than, the value reported
previously for LS174T tumors (8.08 × 10−5 vs. 6.35 × 10−5/min) [23].
Plasma flow rate to tumors was based on the reported value of 0.212 ml/min/g tumor for
LS174T tumors [20]. Initial efforts to model tumor blood flow as a function of tumor
volume led to convergence problems with the software. As such, tumor blood flow and
lymph flow rates were modeled as time-invariant constants. The plasma flow rate, 0.18 ml/
min, was based on a tumor size of 0.85 g, which is close to the average tumor volume
observed in this work. Of note, the largest tumor size observed in our in vivo studies was ~2
g for LS174T and ~1.3 g for HT29 tumors.
For anti-VEGF treated tumors, we assumed a 50 % reduction in plasma flow rate to tumor
(0.087 ml/min). This assumption was based on our previous observation of ~50 % reduction
in tumor permeability to Evans blue dye [28], and the observations of 50 % reduction in
blood flow by Pastuskovas and coworkers in anti-VEGF treated ovarian cancer xenografts
[43]. Anti-VEGF treated tumor growth rate was expressed as
The plasma flow rate to the lung was calculated as:
where Qi is plasma flow rate and Li is lymph flow rate to organ i. The lung flow rate was
reduced from 4.24 to 4.15 ml/min after reducing the plasma flow rate to anti-VEGF treated
tumors. The assumed minimal effect of bevacizumab on total plasma flow is consistent with
a prior report that demonstrated that anti-VEGF treatment does not lead to alterations in the
plasma flow rate to non-tumor tissues [50].
CEA plasma concentrations were not measured in this study. In prior work, CEA plasma
concentration in LS174T-bearing mice was found to be less than 0.01 nM [23], which is
100,000-fold lower than the reported mean antigen concentration for LS174T tumors.
Hence, the present model assumed that there is no significant shedding of antigen into
plasma.
The variability (%CV) associated with literature reported T84.66-CEA equilibrium
dissociation constants was 54.5 % (Table 1). The relatively high variability for this estimate
is likely related to the use of different methods for assessment of binding affinity (e.g.,
surface plasmon resonance technology, [39] or cell binding assays [40]). Given the knownAbuqayyas and Balthasar Page 9
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 December 01.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptimpact of Kd on the terminal elimination profile for drugs demonstrating TMD [51], it is
likely that uncertainty in Kd is a contributing factor to the simulated uncertainty in terminal
portions of the predicted concentration versus time profiles.
Another important determinant of mAb TMD is the expression level of the target antigen
(CEA). The tumor cell lines selected for this work, T84.66 and HT29, differ substantially in
CEA expression, and this is consistent with the observed pharmacokinetic data. Following
administration of doses of 1–25 mg/kg, T84.66 pharmacokinetics were highly dose-
dependent in animals bearing LS174T tumors (Fig. 2), which demonstrate high expression
of CEA. Interestingly, the disposition of T84.66 showed little dose-dependency over the
dose range of 1–25 mg/kg in HT-29 xenograft bearing mice, where plasma clearance was
16.1, 15.8 and 12 ml/day/kg, and dose-normalized AUC 0–10 days  values were 234 ± 20.9,
315 ± 18.1, and 286 ± 25 nM × day/mg at 1, 10, and 25 mg/kg. This apparent linear, dose-
independent pharmacokinetic behavior is consistent with saturation of TMD at much lower
doses in HT29 tumor-bearing mice relative to LS174T tumor-bearing mice. To further
investigate the possible non-linear pharmacokinetics of T84.66 in mice with HT29 tumors,
two additional dose-levels were investigated: 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg. Again, consistent with
TMD mediated by low level antigen expression, clearance was found to be substantially
increased (220 and 130 ml/day/kg).
The PBPK model well described the differences in the pharmacokinetics of T84.66 in the
two different tumors. However, the model under-predicted LS174T tumor concentrations at
late time-points. This under-prediction may be consistent with a time-dependency in T84.66
elimination from LS174T, perhaps indicating slow turnover of CEA following
internalization of T84.66-CEA complexes. This hypothesis will require evaluation in future
work.
Excellent agreement was observed between population-predicted median plasma
concentration–time profiles and observed T84.66 data for HT29 tumor-bearing mice, at 1,
10 and 25 mg/kg (Fig. 6c, d, e). T84.66 observed plasma concentrations at 0.025 and 0.1
mg/kg were below the median population prediction (Fig. 6a, b). Additionally, the
population prediction interval and the standard deviation associated with predicted mean
AUC values were very large at the 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg dose levels (Fig. 5). This
relationship between confidence windows and dose is expected, as the simulation assumes
that the primary factors impacting variability in mAb disposition are determinants of TMD.
At low doses, TMD pathways are not saturated, and small differences in TMD determinants
(e.g., CEA expression level, blood flow, lymph flow) lead to large effects on mAb
disposition. At high mAb doses, TMD pathways are more completely saturated, and this
minimizes the impact of variability in determinants of TMD. The over-prediction of T84.66
concentrations in plasma, tumor, and other tissues at low doses in HT29 xenograft-bearing
mice is likely indicative of model mis-specification. Although not yet experimentally
investigated, we hypothesize that the very high rate observed for T84.66 clearance (220 ml/
day/kg) relates to low levels of shed CEA in plasma, and rapid elimination of soluble CEA-
T84.66 complexes. This type of mAb elimination is a form of TMD, where T84.66 binding
to soluble CEA mediates T84.66 elimination. However, elimination of T84.66 in complex
with shed CEA removes the dependence of T84.66 TMD on tumor blood and lymph flow,
thus allowing the rate of TMD clearance to exceed the maximal rate of convective uptake of
mAb into the tumor interstitial space (note: 
  ml/day/kg).
The model predicted the tumor uptake of 8C2 at 1 and 25 mg/kg very well. However, the
observed rapid elimination of 8C2 from plasma and non-tumor tissues at 1 mg/kg was not
captured by the model. The rapid elimination may be related to non-specific interactions of
8C2 that were not accounted for in the model. Formation of anti-8C2 antibodies may alsoAbuqayyas and Balthasar Page 10
J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 December 01.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptexplain the increased elimination observed for 8C2; however, this possibility is deemed
unlikely, as the investigations have been performed in immune compromised mice, after a
single intravenous dose, with short-term collection of samples. These conditions suggest that
anti-drug antibody development is quite unlikely.
The model also provided very good prediction of the effects of bevacizumab treatment on
T84.66 plasma, tissue, and tumor disposition. Prior work from our group and others has
shown that bevacizumab treatment does not affect the plasma and non-tumor tissue
pharmacokinetics of mAb; however, significant effects are observed on mAb distribution to
tumor tissues (presumably due to bevacizumab effects on neovascularization in tumors,
tumor blood flow, and tumor capillary permeability) [46].
The model predicted mAb concentrations in non-tumor tissues quite well. In most of the
tested scenarios, the predicted concentrations were within the 90 % prediction interval. The
model under predicted concentrations at early time points in tissues such as GI, heart and
lung, and over predicted the early concentrations in muscle and skin. This deviation is likely
related to assumptions inherent within the present model for identical values of the vascular
reflection coefficient in all non-tumor tissues (0.95), and for consistent rates of fluid phase
endocytosis of antibody in all tissues. Additional experimental and modeling work will be
required to identify tissue-specific values relating to drivers of convective transport of mAb
(e.g., lymph flow rates, σtissue), to evaluate whether this will allow improved prediction of
mAb disposition.
In summary, this work evaluated several putative determinants of the disposition of
monoclonal antibodies in mouse models of cancer, including antibody dose, target
expression, mAb-target internalization rates, and antibody specificity for tumor antigens.
Additionally, the impact of these factors on the plasma, tissue, and tumor pharmacokinetics
was predicted via simulation with a PBPK model, through the use of parameter estimates
derived from previously published work. The model provided very good prediction of the
observed data for two different mAb, in two tumor models, with or without prior
bevacizumab therapy. As such, our results indicate that PBPK modeling has potential for
prediction of tumor and tissue concentration versus time data, which are typically
inaccessible in preclinical and clinical evaluations of mAb disposition. It is anticipated that
further development of mAb PBPK models, coupled with improved experimental methods
to characterize target expression and dynamics, will allow accurate, a priori prediction of
mAb plasma and tissue disposition in experimental models and, eventually, in humans.

The disposition of monoclonal antibodies in plasma and tissues, including tumors that express target antigens, can be predicted using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model.

Research Proposal:
To evaluate the utility of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for predicting the disposition of monoclonal antibodies in plasma and tissues, including tumors that express target antigens. This will involve conducting in vivo studies with two different monoclonal antibodies (8C2 and T84.66) in two tumor models (LS174T and HT29) and in non-tumor bearing control mice, with co-administration of bevacizumab to modulate tumor vascularization and blood flow. The study will also investigate the impact of factors such as antigen expression, antibody-antigen internalization rates, and antibody specificity for tumor antigens on the plasma, tissue, and tumor pharmacokinetics. The results will be used to develop and validate a PBPK model for predicting the disposition of monoclonal antibodies in preclinical and clinical settings."
"Nucleic acids can not only hybridize to one another based 
on a simple code, but can also form complex shapes that 
may act as scaffolds for molecular interactions and support  
complex formation with protein and small-molecule  
targets. Although this is true for biological nucleic acids1–4, 
it was only recently that a series of technological advances 
allowed the development of in vitro  evolutionary meth -
ods for the discovery of additional, non-biological oligo -
nucleotides  that can bind to protein targets. Advances in 
DNA synthetic methods have enabled the generation of 
large populations of degenerate oligodeoxynucleotides, 
while PCR allows small numbers of molecules to be 
amplified into amounts that can be readily manipulated 
by researchers. When these two advances were iteratively 
coupled with the ability to partition oligonucleotides on 
the basis of their binding or catalytic activities, in vitro  
selection of functional nucleic acids (termed SELEX ) was 
born5,6. Nucleic acid ligands generated using SELEX have 
been termed aptamers , an invented Latin term that means 
‘to fit’ . Aptamers are one of only a few classes of molecules 
that, like antibodies, can be crafted to bind to multiple 
different  targets.
In a typical SELEX experiment a random sequence 
oligonucleotide library is synthesized that spans 20–100 
residues in length, and each nucleotide is flanked by 
constant sequences required for enzymatic manipulation. 
The pool will frequently contain between 1 × 1013 to 1 × 
1015 members, although it is claimed that even less diverse 
pools will yield useful aptamers7,8. In the case of RNA 
SELEX5,6, the library of single-stranded RNA molecules is 
prepared by the in vitro  transcription of double-stranded 
DNA templates, usually using recombinant T7 RNA 
polymerase. In the case of DNA SELEX, the library of 
single-stranded DNA molecules is often prepared by the 
strand separation of double-stranded PCR products9.Since the invention of the SELEX process around 1990 
(REfS 5,6), researchers have identified high-affinity aptam -
ers that target a broad cross-section of protein families 
including cytokines, proteases, kinases, cell-surface 
receptors and cell-adhesion molecules (TABLE 1) . Although 
traditional SELEX methods require a soluble, pure form 
of the target, newer methods have been developed that 
target aptamers in a complex mixture such as cell-surface 
proteins10 and human plasma11. Structurally constrained 
peptides and protein domains or fragments can also be 
used to generate aptamers in instances for which the full 
protein is not available or for when targeting of aptamers 
to a particular protein domain or site is  desired.
For therapeutic applications aptamers are frequently 
in competition with small molecules and antibodies. 
Initially, aptamers targeted to VEGf found utility in the 
treatment of wet macular degeneration12, in part because 
they had long half-lives in the ocular compartment. 
Aptamers that have properties more suitable for systemic 
administration are now being developed, primarily 
against targets in the bloodstream, such as thrombin , 
factor IXa and von Willebrand factor , or on cell surfaces  
such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It may 
eventually be possible to use aptamers to access targets 
inside cells, either by delivering themselves or other 
drugs across membranes. In addition, the types of aptam -
ers that can be discovered are beginning to expand, and 
now include agonists as well as antagonists. One aptamer 
has so far been marketed for therapeutic application, and 
a further eight aptamers are currently being evaluated 
in the clinic, including those comprising DNA, modi -
fied RNA and Spiegelmers . How the structural, chemical 
and pharmacokinetic characteristics of these and other 
aptamers influence their eventual clinical utility is a 
primary focus of this  Review.Institute for Cell and

Abstract | Nucleic acid aptamers can be selected from pools of random-sequence 
oligonucleotides to bind a wide range of biomedically relevant proteins with affinities and 
specificities that are comparable to antibodies. Aptamers exhibit significant advantages 
relative to protein therapeutics in terms of size, synthetic accessibility and modification  
by medicinal chemistry. Despite these properties, aptamers have been slow to reach  
the marketplace, with only one aptamer-based drug receiving approval so far. A series  
of aptamers currently in development may change how nucleic acid therapeutics are 
perceived. It is likely that in the future, aptamers will increasingly find use in concert with 
other therapeutic molecules and modalities.REVIEWS

Aptamers as therapeutics.  Aptamers can be used for 
therapeutic purposes in much the same way as mono -
clonal antibodies. However, unlike traditional methods 
for producing monoclonal antibodies, no organisms are 
required for the in vitro  selection of oligonucleotides. 
This freedom from cellular biochemistry offers a huge 
advantage in manipulating the process of directed evolu -
tion. As we will see, chemistry, selection conditions and 
targets can be manipulated in vitro  in ways that would be 
difficult or impossible if organisms were involved.
In addition, aptamers have a unique niche relative to 
other oligonucleotide therapeutics. For antisense oligo -
nucleotides  or siRNAs , the therapeutic target is intracell  ular, 
whereas aptamer therapeutics can be developed for intra -
cellular, extracellular or cell-surface targets. Targeting 
proteins in these latter two classes alleviates the necessity 
for the therapeutic to cross the cell membrane. much like 
monoclonal antibodies13, aptamers can theoretically be 
used therapeutically in any disease for which extracellu -
lar blockade of protein–protein interactions is required. 
The focus on extracellular targets has so far not been 
a limiting factor for aptamer development, as aptamers 
are currently undergoing clinical evaluation for ocular diseases, haematological diseases and cancer14,15. Some 
advantages and limitations of aptamers in comparison 
to antibodies are described in BoX 1.
The utility of SELEX for therapeutic applications.  many 
aptamers that are selected to bind to a specific protein 
also inhibit its function. This is possibly because protein 
active sites offer more exposed heteroatoms for hydrogen 
bonding and other interactions. Another explanation 
is that aptamers have a limited number of interactions 
that they can make with a protein target, and therefore 
aptamers that ‘fit’ into a crevice on a protein, such as an 
active site, are more likely to be selected (the so-called 
homing principle).
most therapeutically useful aptamers tend to inhibit 
protein–protein interactions, such as receptor–ligand 
interactions, and thereby function as antagonists. 
However, at least some aptamers have been shown to 
have agonist-like activities. For example, aptamers iso -
lated against the extracellular domain of the protein 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3; 
also known as ERBB3) can promote oligomerization 
(although this does not result in inhibition of down -
stream phosphorylation)16. By contrast, a DNA aptamer Table 1 | Aptamers to targets of therapeutic interest

editing activity17. For antagonists, therapeutic effects are 
only observed as long as the aptamer can physically dock 
with the target. If the binding affinity of the aptamer is 
high, it is likely that the therapeutically relevant effect 
will be more prolonged. Therefore, as with many other 
drugs, the key features of aptamers that must be opti -
mized for drug development include high affinity and 
specificity, and a long half-life in the relevant biological 
compartment. SELEX protocols have now been devel -
oped to increase target affinity (by decreasing off-rates) 
and to increase specificity18. For example, specificity 
can be selected for by using a specific subdomain of a 
protein as a target, or by immobilizing the target using 
a specific method or affinity tag9. Iteratively toggling 
or switching between multiple targets during selec -
tion (for example, between the full-length protein and 
a specific subdomain) can drive binding to a particular 
epitope19. Negative selection against closely related tar -
gets together with positive selection against the desired 
target can reduce cross-binding that might elicit toxicity20. Alternatively, sequential selection against different targets 
can be used to ensure that aptamers cross-bind to species 
homologues, yielding aptamers that can be used in both 
animal models as well as in humans21.
In general, wild-type RNA and DNA molecules are 
too susceptible to nuclease -mediated degradation to be 
useful for most therapeutic applications. Accordingly, 
most SELEX experiments for therapeutics use oligonu -
cleotides that are chemically modified in some manner. 
These approaches rely on DNA or RNA polymerases 
that can accept appropriately modified nucleotide  tri-
phosphates as substrates. modified nucleotides can be 
introduced into libraries before initiation of SELEX by 
polymerases that can accept modified nucleotide tri -
phosphates. This process can yield aptamers that are 
partially or completely substituted with one or more 
modifications, including 2 ′-amino pyrimidines22–24, 
2′-fluoro pyrimidines25–2 7, and 2′-O-methyl ribose 
purines and pyrimidines28,29 (fIG. 1a) . Internucleotide

An internucleotide 
phosphodiester linkage  
in which a non-bridging 
oxygen is substituted  
with a sulphur.polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be conjugated to the 
5′-terminus . Finally, a wealth of chemistries are available 
by modifying nucleobases (for example, the 5 -position  
of uridine33). The presence of these modified nucleo -
tides stabilizes oligonucleotides against nuclease-
mediated degradation, and imparts greater affinities  
to selected aptamers. So far, the highest affinity  
aptamers that have been reported in the literature contain modified nucleotides and bind in the single-digit pico -
molar range (see REf. 22 for an example). The choice of 
RNA versus DNA, and sugar, phosphate and nucleobase 
modifications is largely driven by the need for stability; 
however, a finer appreciation of how these modifica -
tions affect function is for the most part still needed. 
For a fuller review of this topic see REf. 18 .
Spiegelmers34–44 are aptamers in which the sugars are 
the enantiomers (non-identical mirror images) of wild-
type nucleic acid sugars. In the case of RNA Spiegelmers, 
the oligonucleotide backbone is composed entirely of 
l-riboses linked by phosphodiesters. Because nucleases 
are highly stereoselective these molecules are several 
orders of magnitude more nuclease-resistant than the cor -
responding wild-type RNA ( d-ribose) sequences. SELEX 
cannot be performed with l-ribonucleotides directly 
because wild-type RNA polymerases will not accept 
l-ribonucleotide triphosphates as substrates and it is  
not yet technically feasible to prepare enantiomeric  
RNA polymerases ( d-amino acids). Instead, wild-type RNA  
SELEX is performed using the enantiomer of the desired 
target. The sequences of wild-type RNA transcripts that 
bind to the enantiomer of the desired target, will, when 
prepared synthetically with l-ribose, bind to the desired 
target in the same manner. A significant limitation in the 
Spiegelmer approach is that enantiomeric targets need 
to be prepared synthetically, and so only relatively small 
protein domains or peptides can be  used.
Aptamers as chemicals.  Despite the fact that aptamers are 
discovered using an enzymatic process, aptamers are ulti -
mately generated for therapeutic applications by chemical 
synthesis. Oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using 
solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry in a process that 
has now been practiced for more than 25  years45. This 
process is automated and at small scale is considered 
routine even for oligonucleotides of up to 100  or more 
nucleotides or that contain a wide range of modifica -
tions. These modifications include phosphorothioate 
internucleotide linkages; non-deoxyribose sugars such 
as ribose, 2 ′-fluoro-ribose and 2 ′-O-methyl ribose; and 
oligonucleotide terminal caps, such as inverted nucleo -
tides (fIG. 1c)  or cholesterol. In addition, the process of 
chemical synthesis allows the site-specific introduction 
of non-nucleotide linkers (such as hexaethylene glycol), 
the introduction of chemical functionalities useful for 
conjugation (such as primary amines, thiol precursors 
and aldehyde precursors), and the addition of fluores -
cent or other reporter moieties (fIG. 1d) . In particular, the 
site-specific placement of functional groups for conjuga -
tion means that the modification of aptamers after the 
solid-phase step (fo r example with high molecular mass 
PEG46) leads to products with discrete stoichiometries and 
defined chemical structures. These modifications avoid 
losses of activity that are often seen for stochastically 
modified therapeutic protein conjugates.
The cost of manufacturing aptamers has fallen over 
the past few years as the original patents in this area 
have begun to expire, and as the worldwide demand for 
oligonucleotides has driven the cost of nucleotide phos -
phoramidites down. At larger scales it is now possible Box 1 | Advantages and limitations of aptamers versus antibodies

midites, and less than $20 per gram for 2 ′-fluoro, 2′-ribo 
and 2′-O-methyl RNA phosphoramidites. It is relatively 
straightforward to acquire equipment to synthesize 
aptamers in the 10 g per batch range, and there are 
contract manufacturing organizations that are able to  
extend this to above 1 kg per batch. Purification is 
also straightforward because aptamers spontaneously 
refold after denaturation at elevated temperature or 
by chaotropic agents. These facts combine to make 
it much easier to advance the early stages of a thera -
peutic aptamer discovery project in comparison with a  
corresponding therapeutic antibody discovery  project.
Factors affecting therapeutic potency in vivo
Although the selection of aptamers for therapeutic 
applications is relatively straightforward, the adaptation  
of aptamers for use in vivo has required extensive research. 
Relevant features of many protein therapeutics, such as 
those used in replacement therapies, can be extrapolated 
on the basis of characteristics of known, circulating pro -
teins. For example, therapeutic antibodies tend to have 
long circulating half-lives because of their large molecular 
mass and fcRn-mediated recycling. However, there are 
few circulating nucleic acids from which similar compar -
isons can be drawn. Conversely, even though aptamers are chemicals, as outlined above, they are large by the 
standards of traditional non-protein drugs and do not 
readily cross biological barriers such as cell membranes. 
Thus, many of the general rules that are typically applied 
by medicinal chemists during drug development do not 
apply to aptamers.
most targets for therapeutic aptamers are either in 
solution in the blood plasma or displayed on the surface 
of cells that are accessible from the blood plasma, such 
as on the surface of the vasculature. Aptamers in this 
medium are subject to nuclease-mediated degradation 
by serum nucleases, renal filtration, uptake by the liver 
and other tissues such as the  spleen.
Nuclease resistance.  Aptamers composed of unmodified 
nucleotides have half-lives in the blood that can be as 
short as 2 minutes47. As we have previously stated, chemi -
cal modifications can be incorporated into the nucleotide 
sugars or internucleotide phosphodiester linkages to 
increase serum half-life. Endogenous serum nucleases 
have higher degradation rates when cleaving at pyrimi -
dine residues48 and accordingly the earliest modified 
composition aptamers showed considerable increases 
in serum stabilities even though their purines remained 
unsubstituted during SELEX24,26. more recently, SELEX 
with fully modified oligonucleotide compositions has 
also been reported28. modifications can also be intro -
duced after discovery, in a manner that is conceptually 
similar to small-molecule drug medicinal chemistry. 
medicinal chemistry approaches can also be utilized to 
stabilize aptamers against nuclease-mediated degrada -
tion. Although it is laborious, aptamers can be scanned 
for the site-specific introduction of nuclease-resistant 
modifications26,49,50. The capping of oligonucleotide ter -
mini, especially at the 3 ′-terminus, also increases stability 
to endogenous serum nucleases51. This is often accom -
plished by inverting the nucleotide at the 3 ′-terminus 
so that the oligonucleotide has two 5 ′-termini and no 
3′-termini, as 3 ′-exonuclease activity in serum is much 
higher than 5 ′-exonuclease activity.
Overall, such strategies can greatly increase serum 
half-lives28. Together with mechanisms to avoid renal fil -
tration (see below) highly 2 ′-modified aptamers that are 
conjugated to 40 kDa PEG show half-lives as long as 1 
day in rodents28 and 10 days in humans (see prescribing 
information for pegaptanib  (macugen; Pfizer/Eyetech); 
Further information).
Renal filtration.  most aptamers fall into the 5–15  kDa 
molecular mass range (15–50 nucleotides long) and 
are therefore susceptible to renal filtration regardless 
of how well they resist nuclease-mediated degradation. 
As the molecular mass cutoff for the renal glomerulus 
is 30–50 kDa, aptamers that are conjugated to polymers 
in this size range show significant reduction in renal 
filtration rates. The most commonly used polymer for 
preventing exclusion by renal filtration is high molecular 
mass PEG46,52 ,53.
unconjugated aptamers clear from the mouse circu -
latory system with a half-life of 5–10 minutes, whereas  
40 kDa PEG–aptamer conjugates can have circulating  Figure 1 |  Aptamer modifications. a | Nucleotides can be 
modified by replacing the 2 ′ position with either a fluoro - 
(F), amino - (NH2) or O-methyl (OCH3) group for enhanced

introduced either chemically or enzymatically. b | Bridging 
phosphorothioates can be incorporated enzymatically.  
c | End caps that involve reversing the polarity of the chain

conjugation or to alter pharmacokinetic properties.

half-lives as long as 1 day28. The pharmacokinetic 
behaviours of unconjugated, 20 kDa PEG-conjugated 
and 40 kDa PEG-conjugated aptamers in the mouse after 
intravenous administration54 are shown in fIG. 2.
Cholesterol conjugation has also been reported as 
an alternative strategy to reduce renal filtration rates, 
although the extent of this effect seems to be less than 
for PEG conjugation55. Conjugation of a 40  kDa PEG 
to a 2′ fluoro/2′-O-methyl modified aptamer increased 
its circulating half-life from 0.5  hours to 12  hours when 
administered to Sprague-Dawley rats. moreover, a 40  kDa 
PEG conjugated to a fully 2 ′-O-methyl aptamer persisted 
in circulation with a half-life of 23  hours in mice28.  
In another example, Rusconi et al.56 report the conjuga -
tion of cholesterol to a factor IXa-specific aptamer that 
resulted in an increase in half-life from 5–10 minutes 
to 1–1.5  hours in swine. Aptamer circulating half-lives 
are expected to increase as the clearance rate decreases, 
which is in turn proportional to the mass of the animal 
raised to the power of 0.75 (REf. 57). Consequently, longer 
half-lives are expected to be observed for animals larger 
than  rodents.
Aptamers may be particularly amenable to modifica -
tions that lead to improved pharmacokinetic properties. 
Protein–PEG conjugation is generally performed stochas -
tically through lysine side chains and this often results in 
a mixture of products and a loss of activity. By contrast, 
as aptamers are chemically synthesized and lack many 
of the functional groups commonly present in proteins, 
a single functional group (such as an alkyl amine) can 
be site-specifically introduced and used as a unique site 
for conjugation of other molecules to the aptamer with -
out disrupting structure or function. Such site-specific  
handles for conjugation can be scanned through a 
number of positions to ensure that conjugation to PEG 
does not affect the activity of the conjugate.Toxicology.  As with other therapeutics, aptamer toxicity  
can manifest itself through on-target or off-target 
mechanisms. Off-target effects of oligonucleotides have 
previously been extensively studied as part of the devel -
opment of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, and 
include anticoagulation, complement activation and 
innate immune stimulation. Antibodies to synthetic 
oligonucleotides are not generally observed, but have 
been seen for some oligonucleotide conjugation part -
ners such as PEG58. There is limited published informa -
tion concerning the toxicological properties of aptamer 
therapeutics because so far there is only one approved 
aptamer drug (pegaptanib), which is administered in 
small doses by intravitreal injection. However, there is 
literature concerning the toxicology of antisense thera -
peutics because this modality is a more mature research 
topic; reviews include REfS 59–61 . Antisense oligonu -
cleotide therapeutics and aptamer therapeutics differ in 
several respects including chemical substitution, size, 
secondary structure and conjugation to PEG; however, 
some parallels can be  drawn.
Innate immune activation occurs as a consequence 
of the activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, 
TLR8  or TLR9.  TLR3 responds to double-stranded  
RNA, TLR7  and TLR8 respond to single-stranded RNA, 
and TLR9 responds to unmethylated CG motifs in DNA 
(CpG motifs). Because unmodified RNA is highly sensi -
tive to endogenous nucleases and because 2 ′-modification 
abrogates the TLR response62, it is probably TLR9 that is 
most relevant to the study of potential adverse effects of 
therapeutic aptamers, although other TLRs may be rel -
evant to the interpretation of in vivo responses to siRNA. 
Innate immune responses mediated by TLR9 include the 
activation of antigen-specific B  cells and the secretion 
of cytokines including interleukin-6  and interferon63,64. 
Nevertheless, TLR9-mediated immune responses to oligo -
nucleotides are being considered for therapeutic applica -
tions in which immune stimulation is desirable such as 
in oncology65.
Anticoagulation has been observed in primates 
after administration of oligonucleotides. It is thought 
that this is a consequence of low-affinity interactions 
between the oligonucleotide and protein components 
of the clotting cascade. many of these proteins bind 
to heparin and therefore might be expected to bind to 
other polyanions such as oligonucleotides. measurable 
effects on clotting times have been observed using acti -
vated partial pro-thromboplastin time assays66. This 
effect is probably not significant enough to be of con -
cern to patients as increases in bleeding times have not 
been reported.
Complement activation has been attributed to the 
inter   action of oligonucleotides with complement factor H,  
which is a control protein for the alternative complement 
pathway. Complement activation has been observed in 
studies conducted in nonhuman primates in which 
effects are predominantly acute and seem to manifest 
themselves only after a high oligonucleotide concentra -
tion has been reached. Observations include hypotension 
and elevated heart rate, and can include cardiovascular 
collapse when severe60.Figure 2 | The pharmacokinetics of aptamers

These aptamers were unconjugated or conjugated to

and administered intravenously to CD -1 mice ( n = 3 per 
time point) at 10  mg per kg. Data redrawn from REf. 54.REVIEWS

mulate in cells. This can be observed qualitatively by 
immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization or the histo -
pathology of stained tissue59,67. The accumulated material 
is generally seen in phagocytes such as macrophages or in 
renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Degenerative effects 
have also been observed at high doses68. It is also possible  
that particular mechanisms of accumulation could be 
exploited for therapeutic applications, as described  below.
Aptamers in the clinic
There are now several aptamers that have undergone clini -
cal trials (TABLE 2) , and a consideration of the observations 
that have been made in these trials will provide a better 
understanding of both the possibilities and limitations of 
aptamers as therapeutics. These will be discussed  below.
Pegaptanib.  Pegaptanib69 was approved for therapeutic use 
by the uS Food and Drug Administration in December 
2004  and is currently marketed by Pfizer and Eyetech as 
macugen. Pegaptanib is a vEGF-specific aptamer that 
binds to all isoforms of human vEGFA except for the smallest ( vEGF121). Once pegaptanib is bound to vEGF it 
inhibits the interaction of vEGF with its receptors vEGFR1 
(also known as FLT1) and vEGFR2 (also known as KDR/
FLK1), with an IC50 value of 49 p m26. Pegaptanib was orig -
inally discovered in a 2 ′-ribo purine/2 ′-fluoro pyrimidine 
(rRfy) transcript library using SELEX. Once selected, the 
aptamer was truncated to 27 nucleotides to decrease syn -
thesis costs, and then 12  out of the 14 ribopurines were 
replaced with 2 ′-O-methyl purines to increase nuclease 
resistance. The oligonucleotide was then conjugated to  
40 kDa PEG to reduce the rate with which it distributes 
into tissues and it also was capped at the 3 ′-terminus with 
an inverted nucleotide to reduce 3 ′-exonuclease-mediated 
degradation. Pegaptanib is administered by intravitreal 
injection of 0.3  mg per eye once every 6 weeks, and is used 
to ameliorate the loss of visual acuity that is caused by the 
aberrant angiogenesis that is characteristic of age-related 
macular degeneration (A mD)70. Although pegaptanib 
sold well after regulatory approval, it has more recently 
lost significant market share to the antibody fragment 
ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech), which binds to all 
isoforms of human vEGFA including  vEGF121.Table 2 | Aptamers in the clinic

oligodeoxynucleotide that contains only guanines and 
thymines and exists in solution as a guanine-quartet-
mediated dimer. AS1411 is thought to elicit its thera -
peutic effects through its interaction with nucleolin71. 
AS1411 was discovered as part of a screen of antisense 
oligonucleotides for antiproliferative activity72. In com -
mon with other therapeutics discovered by cell-based 
screening (as opposed to screening or selection against 
individual protein targets) it is less certain what its exact 
mechanism of action is. various biochemical effects 
have been demonstrated for this molecule including the 
destabilization of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (BCL-2) 
mRNA73, the inhibition of nucleolin-containing com -
plexes74 and the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB75. AS1411 
inhibits the proliferation of cells in a wide range of can -
cer cell lines. The suggested mechanism of action for the 
antiproliferative activity of AS1411 includes binding to, 
and subsequent internalization by, cell-surface nucleolin 
followed by binding to cytoplasmic nucleolin. AS1411 is 
being developed by Antisoma and is currently in Phase  II 
clinical trials for acute myeloid leukaemia, but it has 
recently been decided not to continue clinical evaluation 
of AS1411 for renal cancer76.
REG1.  REG1 is an anticoagulation system that includes 
RB006, a coagulation factor IXa-specific aptamer, and 
its oligonucleotide antidote RB007. REG1 is currently 
being evaluated in the clinic as a reversible anticoagulant 
for use during percutaneous coronary intervention77. 
RB006 was discovered in a 2 ′-ribo purine/2 ′-fluoro 
pyrimidine transcript library using SELEX27. The 
aptamer was then truncated to 34 nucleotides, conju -
gated to 40 kDa PEG to reduce the rate with which it is 
cleared from the serum by renal filtration and capped 
at the 3′-terminus with an inverted nucleotide to reduce 
3′-exonuclease-mediated degradation. RB006 binds to 
coagulation factor IXa with an equilibrium dissociation 
constant ( Kd) of 2.8 n m and prolongs clotting times as 
assessed in activated partial thromboplastin time assays. 
It does not prolong the clotting time of plasma when 
measured in prothrombin time assays, which is as 
expected for a specific coagulation factor IXa inhibitor. 
RB007 is a fully 2 ′-O-methyl substituted 17-mer oligo -
nucleotide that is complementary to the 5 ′-terminal 
region of RB006. RB007 rapidly disrupts the structure of 
RB006 and inhibits its anticoagulation function. REG1 
is being developed by Regado Biosciences. It is currently 
in Phase  II clinical trials and shows rapid onset of anti -
coagulation in vivo after intravenous administration, 
followed by a rapid return to baseline levels after dosing 
of the RB007 antidote78.
ARC1779.  ARC1779 binds to the A1 domain of von 
Willebrand factor19 and inhibits the capacity of this 
domain to bind to platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib 
receptors, thereby eliciting an antithrombotic effect 
without significant anticoagulation79 (fIG. 3) . ARC1779 
was discovered in a degenerate DNA library using 
SELEX and then truncated to 39 nucleotides. It was 
also substituted with a single phosphorothioate linkage to increase target affinity and 5 ′-conjugated to 20 kDa 
PEG to reduce the rate with which it is subject to renal 
filtration. Additional alterations included capping at 
the 3′-terminus with an inverted nucleotide, and 26 
2′-O-methyl modifications were introduced to increase 
nuclease resistance and thermal stability. ARC1779 
binds to von Willebrand factor with a Kd value of 2 n m  
and inhibits platelet function with an EC90 value of 
196 nm80. ARC1779 is being developed by Archemix 
and is currently in Phase  II clinical trials for thrombotic 
microangiopathies and in patients with carotid artery 
disease undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
NU172.  Nu172 is a 26-mer oligodeoxynucleotide that 
is not modified, capped or conjugated and binds to 
and inhibits thrombin by an interaction with exosite 
1. N u172 was discovered within a degenerate DNA 
oligonucleotide library using SELEX and was subse -
quently truncated to 26 nucleotides. It has an IC50 value 
of 5–10  μg per ml in plasma in an ecarin clotting time 
assay as measured by thromboelastography81. This 
aptamer is currently being evaluated in Phase  II clini -
cal trials by ARCA Biopharma. Because N u172 is not 
capped, substituted or conjugated to PEG, it has a short 
duration of action in vivo. Nu172 is intended to be given 
by continuous infusion during cardiopulmonary bypass 
or other surgical procedures to maintain a state of anti -
coagulation with a rapid return to haemostasis once the 
infusion  ceases.
ARC1905.  ARC1905 binds to complement component 5 
(C5), which is thought to play a role in A mD because it 
is pro-inflammatory and has been found in retinal depos -
its of patients with A mD82. ARC1905 was discovered in 
a 2′-ribo purine/2 ′-fluoro pyrimidine transcript library 
using SELEX. It was truncated to 39 nucleotides, 5 ′-con -
jugated to 40 kDa PEG to reduce the rate with which it is 
subject to renal filtration and capped at the 3 ′-terminus 
with an inverted nucleotide25. ARC1905 binds to C5 
with a Kd value of 2–5 n m. ARC1905 is being developed 
by Ophthotech and is currently in Phase  I clinical trials 
in which it is co-dosed with the vEGF-specific antibody 
fragment ranibizumab by intravitreal injection.
E10030.  E10030 binds to platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF), which is known to play a role in the recruitment 
and maturation of pericytes that can increase resistance 
to the anti- vEGF treatment of A mD. E10030 was discov -
ered in a degenerate DNA library using SELEX and then 
truncated to 29 nucleotides. Further engineering efforts 
included 5 ′-conjugation to 40 kDa PEG to reduce the rate 
with which it is subject to renal filtration and capping at 
the 3′-terminus with an inverted nucleotide. In addition, 
it was substituted with seven 2 ′-fluoro nucleotides and 
five 2′-O-methyl nucleotides to reduce nuclease degrada -
tion rates, and it has hexa ethylene glycol linkers in place 
of loops within the oligonucleotide structure83. E10030 
is being developed by Ophthotech and is currently in 
Phase  I clinical trials for A mD in which it is co-dosed 
with the vEGF-specific antibody fragment ranibizumab 
by intravitreal injection.REVIEWS

ligand 12 (CXCL12; also known as SDF -1α), which is a 
chemokine thought to have multiple roles in cell homing, 
tumour metastasis, angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. 
NOX-A12 binds its target with an affinity of less than

tion assay, and significantly reduces glomerulosclerosis 
in a mouse model of type  2 diabetes84. NOX -A12 is an 
l-RNA aptamer (Spiegelmer) that is 45 nucleotides long 
and has no chemical modifications beyond the reversed 
stereochemistry of the sugars and a high molecular mass 
PEG at the 3 ′-terminus. NOX -A12 was selected from a 
wild-type ( d-RNA) library using the mirror-image target 
(d-amino acids), but was ultimately synthesized as an 
l-RNA in order to bind the wild-type target ( l-amino 
acids). NOX -A12 is being developed for use with autolo -
gous haematopoietic stem cell transplants, as inhibition 
of CXCL12 affects the homing, mobilization and reten -
tion of these cells. It is intended to be used in the treat -
ment of multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
NOX -A12 is being developed by NOXXON Pharma and 
is currently being evaluated in a Phase  I clinical trial in 
which it is administered intravenously.
NOX‑E36.  NOX -E36 binds to chemokine (C-C motif) 
ligand 2 (CCL2; also known as mCP1), which is a pro -
tein that recruits monocytes and T  cells from the vascular  
compartment to the extravascular space at sites of 
inflammation. NOX -E36 binds its target with an affinity 
of 150 p m and has an IC50 value of 3 n m in a mCCL2-
stimulated migration assay. It has shown activity in 
a mouse model of lupus nephritis85. Like NOX -A12, 
NOX -E36 is an l-RNA aptamer (Spiegelmer) that is 
40 nucleotides long and has no chemical modifications 
beyond the reversed stereochemistry of the sugars and a high molecular mass PEG at the 3 ′-terminus40,85–87. 
NOX -E36 is currently being developed for the treatment  
of complications of type  2 diabetes, including diabetic 
nephropathy, by NOXXON Pharma. It recently com -
pleted evaluation in a Phase  I clinical trial in which it was 
administered both intravenously and by subcutaneous 
injection.
The future of SELEX and aptamers
Advanced methods for aptamer discovery.  Although 
high-affinity aptamers can be selected against numer -
ous targets, the selection method itself is often labour 
intensive and time consuming. To further advance the 
number and types of aptamers available for therapeutic 
applications, it will be necessary to develop selection 
methods that are more high-throughput and to ensure 
that selected aptamers have exceedingly high affinities 
and are, or can be engineered to be, resistant to degrada -
tion and clearance. There have been several approaches 
to these  goals.
One option is to automate the selection process so 
that aptamers can be reproducibly generated. In an early 
study, the adaptation of aptamer selection protocols to 
liquid-handling robots was attempted88. At a rate of 12 
rounds of selection every 2 days, successful selections 
were achieved in just under 1 week89. Aptamers have also 
been robotically selected against a human protein, u1A, 
coordinately produced in vitro90. The Klussmann group 
at NOXXON  Pharma took automation a step further by 
directly monitoring PCR and quantifying the amount 
of nucleic acid bound to the target36. Although these 
modifications decreased the speed of automated selec -
tion, there were also improvements in the separation of 
RNA from salts, buffers and urea, and a concomitant 
decrease in PCR artefacts.
Affinity capture onto magnetic beads is also amenable 
to miniaturization91,92, and using picomolar amounts 
of targets aptamers with dissociation constants as low 
as 25  nm were selected. However, the most extensive 
work that has been done with high-throughput discovery 
methods for aptamers is that by the company Somalogic, 
where investigators recently reported the selection of 
498 aptamers and their use to simultaneously interro -
gate blood samples93. Somalogic has pioneered the use 
of modified bases  for SELEX, as opposed to just modified 
sugars (for example, 2 ′-O-methyl) or modified inter -
nucleotide linkages (for example, phosphorothioate). 
It is likely that their success in identifying multiple, high-
affinity aptamers against many different targets is in part 
due to the fact that they have capitalized on the dizzying 
range of modifications at the 5 -position of uridine origi -
nally developed and reported by Eaton’s group33,94–96.
most reported initiatives that try to streamline the 
discovery process of therapeutic aptamers focus only 
on the selection and amplification steps. Although it 
is possible that microelectromechanical systems91, 
deep sequencing97 or computational prediction98 will 
accelerate the identification of aptamer",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to develop a high-throughput method for the discovery of therapeutic aptamers with exceedingly high affinities and resistance to degradation and clearance.,"Research hypothesis: We hypothesize that by using advanced high-throughput selection methods and incorporating modified bases, we can discover a diverse set of high-affinity aptamers against various therapeutic targets.

Research proposal: Our research aims to develop a high-throughput method for the discovery of therapeutic aptamers with exceedingly high affinities and resistance to degradation and clearance. We will utilize advanced selection techniques, such as automation, affinity capture onto magnetic beads, and modified bases, to streamline the aptamer discovery process. By doing so, we aim to expand the repertoire of therapeutic aptamers available for various clinical applications."

Gene expression in higher eukaryotes appears to be
regulated by speciﬁc combinations of transcriptionfactors binding to regulatory sequences. The Ets factorPU.1 and the IRF protein Pip (IRF-4) represent apair of interacting transcription factors implicatedin regulating B cell-speciﬁc gene expression. Pip isrecruitedto itsbinding siteonDNA byphosphorylatedPU.1. PU.1–Pip interaction is shown to be templatedirected and involves two distinct protein–proteininteraction surfaces: (i) the ets and IRF DNA-bindingdomains; and (ii) the phosphorylated PEST region ofPU.1 and a lysine-requiring putative a-helix in Pip.

Introduction
In eukaryotes, gene expression appears to be regulated bythe assembly of distinct combinations of transcriptionfactors at promoters and enhancers. The ability of tran-scription factors to interact speciﬁcally with one another,resultingintheformationofhetero-oligomericcomplexes,is an important eukaryotic adaptation that enables thegeneration of diverse inducible and developmentally regu-latedprogramsofgeneexpression.Accordingtothisview,a relatively small set of transcription factors can form anexponentially larger population of distinct multi-proteincomplexes, thereby facilitating the differential regulationof as many as 100 000 genes in a single organism
© European Molecular Biology Organization 977(reviewed by Carey, 1998). Biochemical and functional
characterization of transcription factor complexes hasshown that the structural information necessary for theirassemblyis providedbybothprotein–protein andprotein–DNA contacts. Examples of combinatorial interactionsinclude the cooperative binding of the homeodomainprotein, MAT α2, with the MADS box protein, MCM-1, to
regulatory sites controlling mating type in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (BenderandSprague,1987;TanandRichmond,
1998), the recruitment of the Ets protein, SAP-1, to thec-fos promoter by the serum response factor, SRF (Daltonand Treisman, 1992), and the binding of a Fos–Junheterodimer (AP-1) along with the nuclear factor ofactivated T cells (NFAT) to composite elements in T cellactivation genes (Jain et al., 1992; Chen et al., 1998).
Similar principles of interaction regulate the cooperativeassembly of high mobility group (HMG) protein-con-taining multi-activator complexes on the interferon- β
(IFN-β) gene promoter (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995) and
the T cell receptor- αgene enhancer (Giese et al., 1995).
The concept of combinatorial control of transcription inhigher eukaryotes is supported primarily by transientreporter assays in vivoand analysis of protein–DNA
interactions in vitro. However, the role of combinatorial
interactions in regulating the activity of endogenous genesremains to be tested. In part, this stems from the lack ofageneralapproachforassayingthefunctionsofinteractingtranscription factors in vivo.
The lymphoid-restricted interferon regulatory factor,
Pip (IRF-4), and the hematopoietic-speciﬁc Ets protein,PU.1, form complexes in B cells on composite elementspresent in immunoglobulin light chain (IgL) geneenhancers (Pongubala et al., 1992; Eisenbeis et al., 1993).
In transient assays, these elements have been shown tobe essential for enhancer activity. When co-expressedectopically,PU.1andPipsynergisticallyactivatetranscrip-tion of a reporter gene containing multiple copies ofthe composite element from the IgL λenhancer, E
λ2-4
(Eisenbeis et al., 1995). However, the role of PU.1–Pip
complexes in regulating the expression of endogenousIgL genes remains to be elucidated. PU.1–Pip ternarycomplexes also assemble on the promoter of the CD20
gene, which encodes a protein implicated in B cellactivation (Himmelmann et al., 1997). In each instance,
the binding of Pip to DNA is dependent on DNA-boundPU.1, which must be phosphorylated on Ser148 (pSer148;Pongubala et al., 1993). A C-terminal regulatory domain
within Pip itself is also required for ternary complexassembly (Brass et al., 1996). In addition, this regulatory
domain autoinhibits binding of Pip to DNA in the absenceof PU.1. Fusion of this regulatory domain to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of a related IRF produced achimericproteinwithPU.1-dependentDNA-bindingactiv-ity.Therefore,thisdomaincontainsstructuraldeterminantsA.L.Brass, A.Q.Zhu and H.Singh
important for both PU.1 interaction and autoinhibition
(Brasset al., 1996). The nature of these determinants
remains to be deﬁned.
Within the IRF family, Pip is most closely related to the
interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP).ICSBP is a lympho-myeloid-restricted repressor of inter-feron-inducible gene transcription (Driggers et al., 1990;
Nelsonet al., 1993). Similarly to Pip, ICSBP also binds to
Ets–IRF composite elements (EICE) in a PU.1-dependentmanner (Eisenbeis et al., 1995). However, unlike Pip,
ICSBP does not contain an activation domain and, there-fore, PU.1–ICSBP complexes are less potent activators(Sharfet al., 1995; Brass et al., 1996). ICSBP and Pip
can each form complexes on an EICE with the lymphoid-restricted Ets protein, Spi-B, a homolog of PU.1 (Rayet al., 1992; Su et al., 1996; Brass, 1998). These ternary
complexesaredependentonthepresenceofaphosphoser-ineinSpi-B(pSer149),andmutationsinPipwhichpreventinteractions with PU.1 also block association with Spi-B,suggesting a common mechanism of complexation (Brass,1998). Thus, based on the expression patterns of PU.1,Spi-B, Pip and ICSBP, up to four combinations of Ets–IRF ternary complexes can regulate gene expression inB cells, while in myeloid cells only PU.1–ICSBP com-plexes can assemble on target genes.
Gene targeting has shown that while Pip is dispensable
forantigen-independentlymphoiddevelopment,itisessen-tial for B and T cell activation (Mittrucker et al., 1997).
B cells from Pip-deﬁcient mice cannot produce antibodiesin response to infection, and T cells from these animalsare defective in cytotoxic and antitumor capabilities. Inaddition, Pip is overexpressed in T cells infected withhuman T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) and may, there-fore, be involved in viral-mediated cellular transformationand the resulting adult T cell leukemia (ATL; Yamagataet al., 1996). Further evidence for Pip-mediated onco-
genesis comes from studies showing that Pip is overex-pressed in human multiple myeloma cell lines, due to achromosomal translocation (Iida et al., 1997). Mice deﬁ-
cient in ICSBP demonstrate increased sensitivity to viralinfection and exhibit a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like syndrome, suggesting that ICSBP may function as atumor suppressor gene (Holtschke et al., 1996). PU.1 is
essential for the development of lymphoid and myeloidlineages, while Spi-B is important for B cell activationand survival (Scott et al., 1994; Su et al., 1997).
Based on the above observations, we postulate that
Ets–IRFternarycomplexesmayplaykeyrolesinimmuno-logical responses. Therefore, understanding ternary com-plex assembly should provide insight into both themechanism and the biological function of combinatorialinteractionsingeneexpression.Hereweundertakeaseriesof biochemical studies to elucidate this mechanism, andﬁnd that interdependent protein–protein and protein–DNAcontacts regulate PU.1–Pip ternary complex assembly.Additionally, to analyze the function of these factorsin vivo, we engineered chimeric repressors containing the
ets and IRF DBDs connected by a ﬂexible POU domainlinker. When stably expressed, the wild-type fused dimerstronglyrepressedtheexpressionofarearrangedimmuno-globulinλgene,therebyestablishingthefunctionalimpor-
tance of PU.1–Pip complexes in B cell gene expression.Comparative analysis of the wild-type dimer with a series
978of mutant dimers distinguished a gene regulated by PU.1
and Pip from one regulated by PU.1 alone. This strategyshould prove generally useful in analyzing the functionof interacting transcription factors in vivoas well as in
identifying novel genes regulated by such complexes.
Results
Multiple residues in Pip’s interaction helix are
important for both ternary complex formation
with PU.1 in vitro and transcriptional synergy
in vivo
Previously,usingdeletionanalysisandsecondarystructure
predictions, we suggested that a putative α-helical region
(aminoacids399–413)inPip’sC-terminusisimportantforternary complex formation with PU.1 (Figure 1A and B;Brasset al., 1996). As noted, PU.1 and Pip function as
mutually dependent transcriptional activators in vivo.W e
therefore examined the functional importance of Pip’sinteractionregion,bytestingaseriesofC-terminaldeletionmutants for transcriptional activation with PU.1. Expres-sion plasmids encoding PU.1 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Pip deletion mutants were co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells, along with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase(CAT) reporter construct containing a tetramer of the E
λ2-4
composite element (B4-TKCAT; Figure 1A; Eisenbeis
et al., 1993). Consistent with previous data, PU.1 and Pip
(FLPip) synergistically activated transcription (17-fold).Pip deletion mutants which retained the ability to form aternarycomplexwithPU.1(1–439and1–419;Brass etal.,
1996;datanotshown)stimulatedtranscriptioncomparablewith full-length Pip. Further deletion into the regionencompassing the putative α-helix (1–410) severely
reduced ternary complex formation and abolished syner-gistic activation of transcription. Western blotting showedthatthePipdeletionmutantswereexpressedintransfected-cells at equivalent levels (data not shown). Thus, theα-helical region in Pip’s C-terminus is important for
both interaction with PU.1 in vitroand transcriptional
synergyin vivo.
Toanalyzethestructuraldeterminantsrequiredforthese
activities, we examined the region in Pip (amino acids389–420) that encompasses this interaction helix, usinga series of alanine substitution (AS) mutant proteins(Figure1B,bottom).Mutagenesiswasdoneinfourresidueincrements, and the in vitro translated (IVT) mutant
proteins (Figure 1C) were assessed for their ability toform ternary complexes with PU.1 and a probe containingthe E
λ2-4composite element ( λB; Figure 1D). Equimolar
amounts of the IVT Pip proteins were used based onPhosphorImager analysis of SDS–PAGE gels (Figure 1C).TheλB composite element (AAAGGAAGTGAAACCA)
contains a PU.1-binding site at its 5 9end separated by
2 bp from the Pip-binding site. The alanine substitutionof amino acids 397–400 (PipAS397) and 401–404(PipAS401) within the predicted helix impaired ternarycomplex formation, resulting in ~1 or 26% binding,respectively, as compared with wild-type Pip (Figure 1D,comparelane3withlanes6and7).Furthermore,theregionimmediately preceding the helix, amino acids 389–392(PipAS389), was also important for complex formation(17% of wild-type Pip binding; Figure 1D, lanes 3 and 4).
To test the functional properties of these Pip mutantsPU.1–Pip ternary complex

(A) Transient transfection analysis of the indicated Pip C-terminal deletion mutants in NIH-3T3 cells in the absence or presence of PU.1. The
reporter construct, B4-TKCAT, contains four copies of the PU.1–Pip composite binding element. Fold-activation (solid bars) indicates CAT activitynormalized to the control expression vector and is the average of two independent experiments. Error bars denote standard deviation. The Pipderivatives are schematized below and their respective abilities to form a ternary complex with PU.1 and λB DNA in gel shift assays are indicated

The locations of the DNA-binding domain (DBD), activation domain (AD) and regulatory domain (RD) are shown, based on previous deletionanalyses (Brass et al., 1996; Brass, 1998). The amino acid sequence encompassing the putative interaction helix in Pip and the homologous region in
ICSBP as well as the alanine substitution strategy are shown below. Areas of amino acid sequence identity are boxed and the predicted helix(amino acids 399–413) is underlined. ( C) SDS–PAGE analysis of [
35S]methionine-labeled in vitrotranslated (IVT) Pip mutant proteins used for

PU.1 with the λB site as a DNA template. Each PipAS mutant contains a clustered substitution of four alanine residues beginning at the indicated
position. FLPip refers to the full-length wild-type protein. Equimolar amounts of the Pip proteins were used based on PhosphorImager analysis ofSDS–PAGE gels. The positions of the PU.1 and PU.1–Pip protein–DNA complexes are indicated on the left.
(AS393–AS413), we assayed for transcriptional activation
in conjunction with PU.1, as described above. Consistentwiththebiochemicalanalysis,PipAS397wasleasteffectivein stimulating transcription (Table I). Partial activation oftranscriptionbythismutantproteinmaybeduetoitsabilityto associate weakly with PU.1 and DNA through aninteraction between the IRF and ets DBDs (see below).The increasing ability of the PipAS401, 405 and 409proteinstostimulatetranscriptioncorrelatedwithincreasingpropensity for ternary complex formation (Figure 1D;Table I). Western blot analysis of transfected cell lysatesshowed that the wild-type and Pip mutant proteins wereexpressedatcomparablelevels(datanotshown).Therefore,the structural determinants of Pip that are important forternary complex assembly are also required for transcrip-tional activation in vivo.
To examine residues in the predicted α-helix important
forPU.1interaction,weassayedsinglealaninesubstitutionsof amino acids 397–400, since this region was essential forcomplex formation. This experiment showed that Lys399wasimportantforternarycomplexformation,asitssubstitu-tion by alanine resulted in 8% of wild-type complex
979assembly (Figure 1E, lane 7). A substantial retention of
wild-type binding (40%) was seen after substitution of anarginine for lysine at that position (Figure 1E, comparelanes 9 and 3). Alanine subsitutions of Arg398 and Leu400also diminished complexation (45 or 31% of wild-typebinding levels; Figure 1E, compare lane 3 with lanes 6 and8). Together, these data suggest that multiple side chainswithin this region may contact PU.1. Next, we attemptedtodisruptthe foldingoftheinteraction helixbysubstitutinga proline for glutamine at position 406 (PipE406P). Thisprotein has two consecutive proline residues, which shouldbreak the presumed α-helix. PipE406P showed severely
reduced interaction with PU.1 (2% of wild-type levels;Figure 1E, compare lane 10 with lane 3). Importantly,mutation of this Glu406 to an alanine had no effect onternary complex formation, indicating that the nature of thesidechainwasnotcritical(datanotshown).Takentogether,these observations suggest that the predicted α-helix is
essential for PU.1–Pip interaction.
As noted, previous deletion analysis suggested that Pip’s
interaction helix was also required for autoinhibition ofDNA binding (Brass et al., 1996). To determine residuesA.L.Brass, A.Q.Zhu and H.Singh

importantforautoinhibition,wecomparedtheDNAbinding
of alanine substitution mutants with wild-type Pip usinggelshiftassayswithreducedlevelsofthenon-speciﬁcDNA-binding competitor, poly(dI–dC) (Figure 2A). IndependentDNA binding by Pip deletion mutants is inhibited by highconcentrations of poly(dI–dC) (Brass et al., 1996). As
shown previously, full-length Pip cannot bind to DNA intheabsenceofPU.1;however,aC-terminaldeletionmutant,Pip 1–410, can bind DNA independently (Figure 2A,comparelanes2and3;Brass etal.,1996).Alaninesubstitu-
tion mutagenesis of residues 389–420 showed that aminoacids 401–408 were speciﬁcally required for autoinhibition(Figure 2A, compare lane 2 with lanes 7 and 8). Alaninesubstitution of amino acids 401–404 and 405–408 resultedin 9- and 15-fold increases in binding above background,respectively. The alanine substitution mutant PipAS389generated an anomolous rapidly migrating protein–DNAcomplex. This complex is probably due to a truncated Pipprotein produced by partial proteolysis. It should be notedthat the majority of this mutant protein is full length(Figure 1C). Mutation of E406 to proline also generated aprotein which bound DNA independently (32-fold abovebackground),suggestingthatoverallhelixintegrityisneces-sary for both autoinhibition and ternary complex formation(Figure 2A, compare lanes 2 and 12). Independent DNAbinding of these Pip mutants was speciﬁc, because theydid not recognize a probe containing a mutation in the Pip-binding site, B2 (GAAACC to cgtACC; data not shown).Aslowermobilitycomplex(Pip*)wasobservedinreactionscontaining mutants which had lost autoinhibition(Figure 2A, lanes 3, 7, 8 and 12). This complex did notform on the B2 probe and was supershifted by anti-Pipantiserum(datanotshown),suggestingthatitmayrepresenta Pip dimer–DNA complex.

to be blocked upon sequencing but retained the His tag byWestern blotting (data not shown). Therefore, we estimatethat this 20 kDa domain comprises the ﬁrst 180 residuesof Pip.

Therefore, these experiments establish that a functionalA.L.Brass, A.Q.Zhu and H.Singh
regulatory domain, containing the regions necessary for
ternarycomplexformationandautoinhibition,resideswithinan independently folded protein module (amino acids 170–450). This domain is tethered to the DBD by a protease-sensitive linker (Figure 3A, bottom). As noted above, thisexperimentalsoexaminedpotentialconformationalchangesin Pip uponassembly into the ternarycomplex. No changesin the rate or pattern of proteolysis were detected when Pipwas recruited by PU.1 on λB DNA (Figure 3A, compare
lanes 1–6 with lanes 7–12). Similar results were obtainedusingV8protease,trypsinandthermolysin(datanotshown).These data suggest that any PU.1-induced conformationalchange within Pip occurs by pivoting of Pip’s regulatorydomain about the ﬂexible linker.
Pip’s regulatory domain greatly stimulates DNA
binding cooperativity with PU.1
We analyzed the contribution of Pip’s regulatory domain
to ternary complex assembly by comparing the bindingafﬁnity of the full-length protein with that of its DBD.Quantitative gel shift assays were performed with afﬁnity-puriﬁed recombinant proteins. Conditions were establishedto occupy 80% or greater of the λB probe with PU.1, so
astoprovidemaximalPU.1–DNAcomplexesforinteractionwith Pip. We observed that the DNA-binding activity ofPip was completely dependent on the presence of PU.1 atall protein concentrations tested (Figure 3B and C). Inaddition, gel shift assays using the phosphorylation-defect-ive PU.1 mutant, PU.1S148A, showed that the binding ofPip was dependent on the presence of pSer148 (data notshown). The data from gel shift assays allowed us tocalculate the equilibrium dissociation constant ( K
d) of Pip
in the presence of PU.1 to be ~2.6 nM (Figure 3D). ThisK
dvalue is likely to be an underestimate, because the
binding curve shows that at saturation, ~75% of therecombinant PU.1 interacts with Pip and is thereforephosphorylated appropriately.
Our earlier experiments indicated that PU.1 weakly
recruited the Pip DBD to DNA, suggesting the existenceofasecondstructuralcomponentofPU.1–Pipcooperativity,not involving Pip’s regulatory domain (Brass et al., 1996).
To explore this observation, we used PU.1 and Pip DBD(aminoacids1–134)proteinsinquantitativegelshiftassaysas described above (Figure 4A and B). Unlike full-lengthPip, the isolated Pip DBD possessed intrinsic, albeit weak,DNA afﬁnity ( K
d~9 6µM, compare Figures 3B and 4A),
consistent with removal of the autoinhibitory domain.Binding by Pip DBD was sequence speciﬁc since nocomplex was detected with the mutant B2 probe (data notshown). Pip DBD bound the λB template with higher
afﬁnity in the presence of PU.1, K
d~2.1µM (Figure 4A
and B). Thus, the Pip DBD has a low intrinsic afﬁnity fortheλB sequence which is increased 20- to 40-fold by PU.1.
We note that the interaction between the isolated DBD ofPipandPU.1isnotdependentonphosphorylationofSer148since the phosphorylation-deﬁcient PU.1S148A interactedwith the Pip DBD equivalently to PU.1 (data not shown).Furthermore, similar experiments revealed that the isolatedets domain of PU.1 (amino acids 160–272) recruited thePip DBD to the λB site comparably with the PU.1 protein
containing the PEST region (amino acids 119–272,Figure 4C). These data suggest that PU.1 and Pip addition-ally interact through their DBDs. However, the afﬁnity of

full-length Pip for the PU.1–DNA complex is .800-fold
greater than that observed for the Pip DBD (2.6 nM versus2.1µM). Thus, the interaction of Pip’s regulatory domain
with the PEST region of PU.1 greatly enhances DNA-binding cooperativity.
PU.1 and the DNA-binding domain of IRF-1
compete for binding to lB DNA
To address whether the association between PU.1 and the
Pip DBD on λB DNA was speciﬁc, we tested the DBD of
the prototypic IRF family member, IRF-1 (Harada et al.,
1988). The IRF domains of Pip and IRF-1 share 43%amino acid identity. Gel shift assays with puriﬁed IRF-1DBD (amino acids 1–113, Escalante et al., 1998) were
performed in the absence or presence of saturating concen-trations of PU.1 or PU.1 DBD (Figure 4D–F). These dataPU.1–Pip ternary complex

indicated components were subjected to glutaraldehyde (0.005%)cross-linking. Reaction products were analyzed by Western blottingusing anti-Pip antiserum. The positions of Pip and the PU.1–Pipadduct are indicated on the right.
demonstrated: (i) the high DNA afﬁnity of IRF-1’s DBD
compared with that of the Pip DBD (compare Figure 4Dwith A, taking note of protein concentrations); (ii) theIRF-1 DBD bound the λB site as both a monomer and a
dimer;and(iii)increasingconcentrationsoftheIRF-1DBDdisplaced either PU.1 or PU.1 DBD from the λB site.
Therefore, the DBDs of IRF-1 and Pip have structurallydiverged, such that Pip binds cooperatively with PU.1,while IRF-1 displaces PU.1 from the composite element.
PU.1 and Pip physically associate in a DNA-
dependent manner
Our model for ternary complex assembly predicted that
direct physical interaction between PU.1 and Pip would beDNA template directed (Brass et al., 1996). Therefore, to
examine the interaction between PU.1 and Pip, glutaral-dehyde cross-linking was performed in the absence orpresence of template DNA (Figure 5B). Reaction productswere separated by SDS–PAGE and analyzed by Westernblotting.Aglutaraldehyde-dependentadductcontainingPipwas detected, with a molecular mass of ~80–85 kDa, inexcellent agreement with the predicted size of a cross-linked species comprising a heterodimer of Pip and PU.1
983(Figure 5B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Western blotting using
anti-PU.1 antisera showed that this protein adduct alsocontained PU.1 (data not shown). Formation of the PU.1–Pip protein adduct was dependent on: (i) phosphorylationof Ser148 in PU.1; (ii) Lys399 in Pip’s interaction helix;and (iii)λB DNA containing intact PU.1- and Pip-binding
sites (Figure 5B, lanes 3–8, probes designated B1 and B2contain severe mutations in either the PU.1- or Pip-bindingsites; detailed in Figure 6B). Therefore, the PU.1–Pipinteraction detected by glutaraldehyde cross-linking dis-played the same requirements as those determined forternary complex assembly using the gel shift assay (Figure5A and B). These results suggest that protein–proteinand protein–DNA interactions function coordinately inestablishing a speciﬁc and stable ternary complex.
Engineering a PU.1–Pip chimeric repressor
As demonstrated above, the protein–protein interactionsbetween Pip and PU.1 are vital for cooperative DNAbinding. Based on these observations, we reasoned that bycovalently coupling the DBDs of PU.1 and Pip, we mightgenerate a fused dimer whose DNA speciﬁcity and afﬁnityare similar to those of the wild-type complex. Since thisfused dimer would lack activation domains, we envisagedthatin vivoit would function as a gene-speciﬁc repressor
by displacing endogenous PU.1–Pip complexes from com-posite regulatory elements. Such a repressor could beused to probe the requirement for PU.1–Pip complexes inregulating the transcription of a productively rearrangedIgL gene, in vivo.
The crystal structure of the PU.1 DBD bound to DNA
shows that the N-terminus of PU.1 faces the binding sitefor Pip (Kodandapani et al., 1996). Therefore, we placed
the Pip DBD (amino acids 1–150) at the N-terminus of thefusion protein and connected it to the PU.1 DBD (aminoacids 160–272) with a linker (26 amino acids) from thePOU domain of Oct-2 (Figure 6A). This linker was chosenbecause it ﬂexibly connects the POU homeo- and POU-speciﬁc domains (Herr and Cleary, 1995), and appearsunstructuredintheOct-1–DNAco-crystalstructure(Klemmet al., 1994). Fused dimers lacking or containing tandem
copies of the linker were analyzed for their DNA-bindingproperties (data not shown). Chimeric proteins containingeither two or three copies of the linker bound to the λB
site with highest afﬁnity. Therefore, the chimera containingtwo copies of the linker (PipPU) was employed in furtheranalysis.
In gel shift assays using the λB site, PipPU preferred
the composite element to one containing only a PU.1 siteby a factor of 3 (Figure 6B, compare lane 5, panels λB
and B2). However, the binding of PU.1 and Pip to λB was
greater than that of the chimera (4-fold), illustrating thaton this site the covalent linkage did not fully recapitulatewild-type afﬁnity (Figure 6B, compare lanes 4 and 5, panelλB). TheλB probe contains a high afﬁnity PU.1-binding
site (AAGGAA), which might mask some of the gain inDNA binding provided by the fusion of the Pip DBD. Totest this, gel shifts were done using the composite elementfrom the CD20 promoter, which contains a lower afﬁnityPU.1-binding site (AA AGAA; Figure 6B, panel CD20).
Consistent with previous data, PU.1 bound with lowerafﬁnity to the CD20 site as compared with λB (Figure 6B,
lane 2, panels λB and CD20; Himmelman et al., 1997).A.L.Brass, A.Q.Zhu and H.Singh

Importantly, the PipPU fused dimer bound the wild-type
CD20 site with an 8-fold higher afﬁnity than the C2 mutantsite, which contains a mutation in the Pip-binding site(Figure 6B, lane 5, panels CD20 and C2). On the CD20element, PipPU bound with comparable afﬁnity to PU.1and Pip (Figure 6B, compare lanes 4 and 5, panel CD20),thus demonstrating that on certain composite elements,
984fusion of the two DBDs can recapitulate the afﬁnity of the
PU.1–Pip complex.
Mutant chimeric proteins were constructed to evaluate
the role of the individual DBDs in the fused dimer(Figure 6A). Alanines were substituted for two criticalresidues within the respective recognition helices of eitherPU.1 (R232A and R235A; Kodandapani et al., 1996) or
Pip (R98A and C99A; Escalante et al., 1998), or both, and
these chimeric proteins were tested for binding to the λB
and CD20 sites. As expected, the Pip mutant (Pipmut)exhibited reduced afﬁnity for the composite sites, andtherefore its binding properties resembled those of PU.1(Figure 6B, compare lanes 2 and 6). Surprisingly, the PU.1mutant (PUmut) bound the λB and CD20 sites with afﬁnity
similar to the wild-type fused dimer (Figure 6B, comparelanes 5 and 7, λB and CD20). Although the DNA afﬁnity
of PUmut was comparable with that of PipPU, its DNAspeciﬁcity was quite different. Unlike PipPU, the bindingof PUmut to the composite element was strictly dependenton the Pip binding site (Figure 6B, lane 7, panels B1 andB2). Importantly, the double mutant (DM) fused dimer didnot interact detectably with the composite sites (Figure 6B,lane 8).
Toexaminethestabilitiesoftheprotein–DNAcomplexes
formed by PU.1 and the fused dimers, dissociation rateswere determined. In these experiments, binding reactionswere permitted to reach equilibrium, at which point theDNA–proteincomplexeswerechallengedwithexcessunla-beled DNA. Decay of the DNA–protein complexes wasmonitored by loading aliquots on a running gel at timedintervals (Figure 6C). The half-life of each complex wascalculated using an exponential decay plot (Figure 6D).The estimated half-life for the PipPU–DNA complex(60 min) was considerably longer than that for PU.1 (6min) or the PU.1 DBD (8 min). These results demonstratethat fusion of the Pip and PU.1 DBDs created a proteinwhich bound DNA with much greater stability than wild-type PU.1 or its DBD. In addition, the signiﬁcantly longerhalf-lifeofthePipmut–DNAcomplex(60min)ascomparedwith that of the PUmut–DNA complex (6 min) suggeststhat PipPU’s binding stability depended on Arg232 andArg235 of the PU.1 DBD. Similar experiments revealedthat the half-life of the PU.1–Pip ternary complex wasnearly identical to that of PU.1 alone (data not shown),suggesting that the elevated DNA-binding afﬁnity of theternary complex, as compared with PU.1, is due to anincreased rate of association.
Wild-type, Pipmut and PUmut chimeras repress
lenhancer function in transient assays
For initial functional analyses, we transiently transfectedexpression plasmids containing PipPU, Pipmut, PUmut orthe DM chimeras into the MPC-11 B cell line along withCAT reporter constructs driven by the V
λ1promoter with
or without the λenhancer, E λ2-4(Figure 7A). Previous
work has shown that the E λ2-4construct (OPC 20) is
preferentially active in B cells, and mutations in either thePU.1- or Pip-binding site within this construct abolishenhancer function (Eisenbeis et al., 1993). Consistent with
previous data, the presence of E

transiently transfected with the indicated expression constructs andeither the OPC-1 or OPC-20 reporters. Solid bars indicate averageCAT activity (percentage chloramphenicol acetylation) of twoindependent transfections. Error bars denote standard deviation. Thestructures of the indicated reporter constructs are shown below.(B) Western blot analysis of MPC-11 B cells transiently transfected

chimeric proteins were expressed in transfected cells as
determined by Western blotting (Figure 7B). The PipPUprotein was somewhat more effective at blocking reportergene activity as compared with the PUmut or Pipmutproteins. Furthermore, transcriptional repression by PipPUwasspeciﬁc,sinceitdidnotinhibittheactivityofareporterconstruct containing a V κpromoter and the intron κ
enhancer (E
iκ; data not shown). Therefore, in transient
assays, both the wild-type (PipPU) and mutant chimeras(PipmutandPUmut)effectivelyblockedenhancerfunction,presumablybydisplacementofendogenousPU.1–Pipcom-plexes.
The PipPU chimeric repressor blocks endogenous
IgLlgene expression when stably expressed in
B cells
The transient assays suggested that both PipPU and the
mutant chimeras (PUmut and Pipmut) might inhibit thetranscription of an endogenously rearranged IgL λgene.
To test this, we generated J558L B cells which stably
985express either the PipPU, Pipmut or PUmut proteins, using
retroviral transduction. We chose the J558L plasma cellline because it expresses a functionally rearranged V λ1–
Jλ1 IgL allele (Figure 8C; Oi et al., 1983). Gel supershift
assays have shown that PU.1 and Pip represent the majorcomponents of the ternary complex formed with nuclearextract from these cells (Brass et al., 1996). J558L B cells
also express the J chain gene, the transcription of whichhas been suggested to be regulated by PU.1 binding to theJ chain promoter (Shin and Koshland, 1993). Analysis ofthe effect of the wild-type repressor on the expression ofthe IgLλand J chain genes would test whether their
activity is indeed regulated by PU.1 in vivo. Parallel
analyses with the mutant repressors would enable thisapproach to distinguish genes regulated by PU.1 and Pip(IgLλ) from those regulated by PU.1 alone (J chain).
Individual J558L clones that expressed similar levels of
the chimeric proteins were identiﬁed by Western blottingusing anti-Pip antiserum (Figure 8B, top). Each of thechimericproteinswasexpressedcomparablywithendogen-ous Pip and their expression did not alter wild-type Piplevels (Figure 8B, top). Since the chimeras and wild-typePU.1 migrate similarly in denaturing gels, we used an anti-PU.1 antiserum which does not recognize the chimera todetermine that expression of the fusion proteins had notaltered endogenous PU.1 levels (Figure 8B, middle). Anadditional antiserum directed against the PU.1 ets domainshowedthatthechimericproteinswereexpressedatconsid-erably higher levels than endogenous PU.1 (Figure 8B,bottom). Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts from thestably transduced cell lines showed that the PipPU andmutant chimeras formed complexes with λB DNA to
similar levels (data not shown).
Northern analysis of total RNA from two clones of each
type was performed to assess levels of IgL λand J chain
gene transcripts (Figure 8A). β-actin transcripts were used
both as a speciﬁcity control and for normalization. Strik-ingly, the wild-type chimera (PipPU) potently repressedendogenous IgL λgene expression (17-fold). This repres-
sion was dependent on both the PU.1 and Pip DBDs, sincethe Pipmut or PUmut mutant chimeras inhibited lesseffectively (5.5- and 1.8-fold repression, respectively).These results establish that PU.1–Pip complexes are essen-tialfortheexpressionofaproductivelyrearrangedimmuno-
globulinλgene in a plasma cell.
Transcription of the J chain gene was inhibited 3.5-fold
by the wild-type PipPU chimera. Unlike the case with theIgLλgene, the J chain gene was repressed equivalently
by the wild-type and Pipmut repressors. It is important tonote that J chain gene transcription was not inhibited bythe PUmut chimera. Therefore, these data demonstrate thatPU.1aloneisrequiredforJchaingeneactivity.Furthermore,the overall analysis establishes the utility of using thePipPU fused dimer and its variants to distinguish genesregulated by PU.1 and Pip from those regulated by PU.1alone.
Discussion
Cooperative binding by PU.1 and Pip is regulated
by multiple interdependent DNA–protein and
protein–protein interactions
Our experiments have focused on understanding the struc-
tural determinants underlying PU.1–Pip ternary complexA.L.Brass, A.Q.Zhu and H.Singh

formation. Previously, we identiﬁed a predicted α-helix
within Pip’s C-terminus (amino acids 395–413) that iscritical for both formation of a ternary complex andautoinhibition of DNA binding (Brass et al., 1996). This
helix is also required for transcriptional co-activation. APip deletion mutant, Pip 1–410, which does not form aternary complex with PU.1 fails to activate transcriptionsynergistically with PU.1. The alanine substitution studydemonstrated that Arg398, Lys399 and Leu400, locatedwithin this predicted helix and conserved between Pip andICSBP, are critical for PU.1–Pip interaction in vitroand
in vivo(Figure 9B). Substitution of Lys399 by arginine
partially restored complex formation, showing that a posit-ively charged residue at this site is an important structuralcomponent of the complex. Both ICSBP and p48 containsimilar residues in respective regions shown by deletionalanalyses to be vital for either interaction of ICSBP withIRF-2 (Sharf et al., 1997) or p48’s association with STAT1
and STAT2 (Veals et al., 1993; Figure 9B). Therefore, such
residues may play a more general role in IRF-containingcomplexes, including those involving IRF-3 (Au et al.,
1995; Wathelet et al., 1998).
An interaction analogous to the one between PU.1 and
Pip, involving the pKID domain of the CREB transcriptionfactor and the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP, ismediated by a phosphoserine residue located within pKID(Parkeret al., 1996). The solution structure of these
heterodimerized domains indicates that a single hydrogenbond between this phosphoserine and a tyrosine residuewithin CBP is critical for complexation (Radhakrishnanet al., 1997). Moreover, three α-helices in the KIX domain

regulatory domain (RD, amino acids 170–450) autoinhibits DNAbinding by masking the Pip DBD. Interaction of Pip with a PU.1–DNA template complex causes the regulatory domain to swivel aboutthe ﬂexible linker region (L) and contact PU.1’s PEST region. Thiscontact is mediated by multiple residues in Pip’s interaction helix,including an electrostatic interaction between K399 of Pip and PU.1’spSer148 (P-S148). Additional contacts between Pip’s DBD and PU.1’sDBD stabilize the ternary complex. ( B) Protein sequence alignment of
IRF interaction regions, with shaded boxes indicating residuesconserved between Pip and ICSBP. Residues in p48 or IRF-3 that arealso conserved with both Pip and ICSBP are also shaded.

overlined. Numbers along the top indicate locations in the proteinsequence of Pip.PU.1–Pip ternary complex
associate to form a pocket which accommodates the pKID
domain by way of extensive hydrophobic contacts, inter-spersed with critical electrostatic interactions. In light ofthisstudy,ourdatasuggestapossiblemechanismforPU.1–Pip association involving an interaction between PU.1’spSer148andPip’sArg398andLys399.Theternarycomplexmayalsobestabilizedbyhydrophobicand/orpolarcontactsbetween Pip’s Leu400, Ile401, Thr402 and His403, andPU.1.Finally, becausea mutantPip proteinwith aninternaldeletion of amino acids 150–340 cannot interact withPU.1 (Brass et al., 1996), it appears that other, as yet
uncharacterizedheliceswithinthisregionmaypacktogetherwith Pip’s helix amino acids 395–413 to form a tertiaryfold which is competent for PU.1 association.
Two biochemical properties of Pip’s interaction helix,
autoinhibition and PU.1 association, have been partiallyuncoupled in these studies. The mutant protein, PipAS397,isdefectiveinitsinteractionwithPU.1,butisautoinhibited.It is unlikely that the binding properties of PipAS397 arethe result of misfolding of this polypeptide, because ourproteolytic analysis shows that Pip is composed of twoindependent structural domains, a DBD domain and aregulatory domain, separated by a ﬂexible linker. Thus, amutation in Pip’s regulatory domain should not perturbthe structure of its DBD. Mutations in a predominantlyhydrophobic patch at the C-terminus of the helix (aminoacids 401–408) resulted in alleviation of autoinhibition. Wepropose that this region inhibits binding by masking theDBD; however, further work will be required to dissectthe actual mechanism of autoinhibition. Intriguingly, abiological role for autoinhibition of Pip’s DNA binding issuggested by studies involving the stable transfection offull-length ICSBP or a truncated protein consisting of theDBD of ICSBP (Thornton et al., 1996). The ICSBP DBD

Mutations in these residues may disrupt the formation of the ternary complex and affect the transcriptional co-activation of PU.1 and Pip.

Research proposal: The study aims to investigate the role of specific amino acid residues within the interaction helix of Pip in regulating the formation of the PU.1–Pip ternary complex and its impact on transcriptional co-activation. The proposal involves mutagenesis of critical residues within the interaction helix of Pip to assess their role in the formation of the ternary complex and their impact on transcriptional co-activation with PU.1. The study will utilize gel shift assays, protein cross-linking experiments, and functional assays in cell lines to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperative binding of PU.1 and Pip and its impact on gene expression."

leaves computational predictions with experimental validation, significantly enhancing the
robustness ofthedesign andselection ofmutants. The platform was tested onthree anti-
body Fab-antigen systems thatspanned awide range ofinitial binding affinities: bH1-VEGF-
A(44nM), bH1-HER2 (3.6 nM) andHerceptin-HER2 (0.058 nM). Novel triple mutants were
obtained thatexhibited 104-, 46-and32-fold improvements inbinding affinity foreach sys-
tem, respectively. Moreover, forallthree antibody-antigen systems over 90% ofalltheinter-
mediate single anddouble mutants thatwere designed andtested showed higher affinities
than theparent sequence. The contributions oftheindividual mutants tothechange inbind-
ingaffinity appear toberoughly additive when combined toform double andtriple mutants.
The new interactions introduced bytheaffinity-enhancin gmutants included long-range elec-
trostatics aswell asshort-range nonpolar interactions. This diversity inthetypes ofnew

mization isprioritizing thesequence space resulting from thecombinatorial explosion when

CDR loops containing 60amino acids there areabout 109different triple mutants possible.

lihood ofimproving binding.
The ADAPT (Assisted Design ofAntibody and Protein Therapeutics) platform wasdevel-
oped toaidintheselection ofmutants that improve/modulate theaffinity ofantibodies and
other biologics. ADAPT interleaves computational predictions with experimental validation,
significantly enhancing therobustness ofthedesign and selection ofmutants. Webriefly
explain theworkflow ofthemethod. The first step isanexhaustive single-point virtual muta-
genesis along theentire CDR sequence. Each amino acid ismutated inturn toeach of18
amino acids (mutation toCysand Proisexcluded) and abinding affinity score iscalculated
relative totheparent sequence. The affinity score isamedian-based composite z-score using
three scoring functions (see Methods section), reflecting how many standard deviations away
from themedian aparticular score is.From the50top-scoring mutants approximately 15
mutants areselected based onamino acid and sitediversity and manual visual inspection of
thevirtual mutants. The Fabfragments forthese arethen produced and their binding affinities
measured bySPR. Typically, around 3±4sites areconfirmed experimentally tobefavorable
sites formutations. This early experimental validation iscritical because itnarrows down the
subsequent mutations tocombinations ofjustthese sites. Thus, weavoid thecombinatorial

didates inthenext round arelimited topairs ofvalidated single mutants±up toabout 30dis-
tinct double mutants. Fora60-amino acid CDR, thisismuch lessthan thetheoretical 1.2x106

binations tothose ofvalidated double mutants and validated single mutants. Furthermore, the
filtering atthesingle-mutant stage also increases therobustness ofthedesign ofhigher order
mutants. Multiple-site mutants areconstructed using only validated single mutants.
This strategy wastested onthree antibody Fab-antigen complexes: bH1-VEGF-A, bH1-
HER2 and Herceptin-HER2 [8,9]. Wechose these three systems because they covered awide
range ofinitial affinities fortheparent sequence, representing increasing challenges forfurther
affinity maturation. Allthree hadcrystal structures forthecomplex, providing asolid starting
point forthevirtual mutation simulations. Our measured affinities forthese bySPR were 44
nM(bH1-VEGF-A), 3.6nM(bH1-HER2) and 0.058 nM(Herceptin-HER2).

ity,albeit lessthan with HG99D. Inthiscase, HG99R forms asaltbridge with D63 onVEGF
(Fig 3A). Also, themethylene groups oftheHG99R and VEGF K48 side chains form nonpolar
interactions. Yetanother way onimproving onHG99 istheHG99M mutation. Instead ofcre-
ating saltbridges itintroduces nonpolar interactions between theMet side chain and side
chains ofVEGF I83and K48 (Fig 3B). Weseethat even onthesame site, there canbequite
varied mechanisms ofenhancing binding affinity. This also demonstrates theversatility ofour
method, which iscapable ofsuggesting multiple strategies forimproving mutations that do
notrely solely onelectrostatics. Earlier studies byLippow etal.suggested that itwasdifficult
toreliably predict affinity enhancements arising from mutations tolarger amino acids and
they relied more onelectrostatics asapredictor ofchanges inbinding free energy [4].More
recently, Kiyoshi etal.carried outanexhaustive virtual single-mutant scan oftheantibody
11K2 against thechemokine MCP-1 and obtained single mutants that hadupto4.6fold higher
affinity than thewild type asmeasured bySPR [7].Alltheir successful mutants were also muta-
tions tocharged amino acids. Unlike thiswork, they didnotgofurther and construct double
and higher order mutants from their single mutations. Inthiscontext, thedesigned HY33W
and HG99M mutants areinformative asthey donotalter thenetcharge and relyonan
increase ofthesizeoftheside chain upon mutation toimprove binding affinity.
Akeyaspect ofourprotocol istheexperimental validation ofdesigned single mutants prior
todesigning and producing double mutants. Toillustrate theimportance ofthisstep consider
thesingle mutants HD98M and LS30dM. The z-scores foreach ofthese mutants were within
thetop5inthevirtual single mutant scan (S1Table). Thus, itwould have been tempting to
immediately make thedouble mutant. However, experimental validation ofthesingle mutants
showed that LS30dM isinfactdestabilizing rather than enhancing, suggesting that making a
double mutant incorporating LS30dM would have been awaste oftime and resources. Tocon-
firm this, thedouble mutant with HD98M and LS30dM wasmade and resulted inagreater
than 10-fold drop inbinding affinity.
The second affinity maturation testwascarried outonbH1-HER2. Fig1Bsummarizes the
results forthree rounds ofoptimization. Inthefirst round, four sites each ontheheavy and

round two, 12double mutants outofapossible 25(S3Table) involving four sites were made
and tested, allofwhich showed further gains inaffinity. Inthethird round, 6triple-mutant
combinations ofthemutants inround twowere made. Allthetriple mutants showed further
increases inaffinity, with thebest achieving about a50-fold improvement (parentKD=3.6nM
versus 0.066 nMforthemutant). Fig2Band 2Eshow thesensorgrams fortheparent bH1 and
best triple mutant, respectively. The improvement inaffinity arises from changes inboth the
konand koffrates (Table 1).The increases inkoncontribute about a6-to10-fold improvement
inKDand about a3-to6-fold contribution from decreases inkoff.The change inkonislikely
duetothelong-range electrostatic interactions [10,11] between thenew Lysand Arg residues
inthemutants and thenetnegative charge ofHER2.
The third affinity maturation testwascarried outonHerceptin-HER2. Weconsidered this
aparticularly challenging testforaffinity maturation since Herceptin isalready such atight
binder (KD=58pM). Fig1Csummarizes theresults forthree rounds ofoptimization. Inthe
first round, twoheavy-chain sites and twolight-chain sites were identified ascandidates for
mutation. Eleven single mutants (z-scores ranging from ±3.8 to±1.0, S1Table) were produced,
nine ofwhich showed some improvement inaffinity. Inthesecond round, seven double
mutants were tested and allshowed improvements over thesingle mutant components. The
double mutants incorporating theheavy chain HD102F hadthebest affinity and were used to
generate triple mutants with light chain single mutant LD28R and LD28K, respectively. Unfor-
tunately, triple mutants incorporating themost active double mutant (HD102F, HD31R) were
heterogeneous upon purification and sowere notincluded inthebinding affinity measure-
ments. The best triple mutant oftheremaining four hadabout a30-fold better affinity than

and best triple mutant, respectively. The contributions tothechange inaffinity break down
into approximately 6-fold and 5-fold changes inkonand koff,respectively (Table 1).The four
triple mutants also exhibited improvements inapparent binding affinity relative totheparent
Herceptin Fabwhen tested byflow cytometry ontwocelllines expressing theHER2 antigen at
different cellsurface densities (S1Fig,S5Table). Hence, theSPR-based binding affinities to
theHER2 ectodomain arequalitatively consistent with thetrend observed forbinding tothe
full-length HER2 expressed atthecellsurface.
Implicit inourapproach ofstepwise build-up ofmutations istheassumption ofadditivity
inthecontribution ofeach mutation tothebinding freeenergy. The data generated inthemul-
tiple cycles ofmaturation allows ustoexamine thisassumption. Fig4isaplot oftheexperi-
mentally measured binding free energy contributions ofdouble/triple mutants versus thesum
ofthecontributions oftheir component single/double mutants. Forthecombined data setof
allthree systems wehave acorrelation ofr2=0.56 and aslope of0.79. Ifweforce theintercept
tobezero weobtain anr2=0.48 and aslope of1.07. Weseethat theassumption ofadditivity
isquite reasonable forthisdata set.One possible reason isthat thecomponent mutations have
allbeen pre-selected tobefavorable mutations. Itislikely that thesum offavorable and unfa-
vorable contributions would belesspredictable.
Discussion
The useofaconsensus z-score iscentral totheADAPT protocol. Inaprevious study [12] we
examined theability ofconsensus scores forpredicting relative binding affinities inantibody-
antigen complexes. Wefound that aconsensus z-score using thescoring functions SIE,Table 1.SPR-measu redkonand koffrates fortheparent sequence and triple mutant s.

ment predictions ofmutants with improved binding. That study wasaretrospective analysis of
data intheSiPMAB database [12], which contains mutational, structural and binding affinity
data forantibody-antigen complexes culled from theliterature. However, atrue testofthepre-
dictive ability oftheconsensus z-score istoapply ittothedesign ofnovel proteins with
enhanced binding affinities. Inthiswork, weused theconsensus z-score approach foraffinity
maturation ofthree antibody-antigen complexes with initial KDvalues ranging from amodest
44nMtoatight 56pM, achieving significant improvement inallthree cases. Furthermore, the
over 100mutants across thethree systems that were predicted toimprove binding affinity
were experimentally found tobehighly enriched with enhanced binders. This suggests that the
consensus z-score used hasutility and transferability beyond theretrospective analysis ofthe
SiPMAB database.
Further support oftheconclusions oftheprevious study [12] about thevalue ofusing acon-
sensus z-score isgiven below. Table 2lists thez-scores and ranks forsome selected single

PLOS ONE |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01814 90 July 27,2017 8/17absence oftheconsensus z-score. Our results areconsistent with ourearlier findings that the
useofconsensus z-scores forranking antibody-antigen binding affinities increases therobust-
ness ofthepredictions [12].
Animportant limitation ofADAPT istheneed forathree-dimensional structure ofthe
antibody-antigen complex. Ideally thiswould befrom acrystal structure fortheparent
sequence orfrom ahigh-quality model based onaclosely related structure. Weexpect thereli-
ability ofthescoring functions used willbequite sensitive totheaccuracy ofthestructure used
asastarting point formodeling themutations. Arelated limitation ofADAPT isthat itisa
very conservative exploration ofconformational space. Although weallow some limited move-
ment and repacking ofside chains inSIE_SCWRL and FOLDX, thebackbone conformation is
essentially assumed toremain unchanged bythevarious mutations. Ofcourse, ingeneral,
backbone conformations canbesequence-dependent. However, thespirit ofADAPT isto
optimize theamino acid sequence foragiven backbone conformation. The expectation isthat
theside chains that aredesigned willbehighly compatible with thegiven backbone inthecon-
textoftheantibody-antigen complex. Another limitation ofADAPT initspresent form isthat
wedonotallow forinsertions ordeletions ofamino acids. This certainly precludes whole col-
lections ofmutation possibilities. However, intheexamples presented here wefind that even
when theCDR chain lengths arekept fixed thesequence space isrich enough toprovide
mutants yielding significant improvements inaffinity.
The application ofADAPT tothethree systems described here focused onimproving affinity
anddidnotexplicitly take developability into account. Apossible concern isthat thepresence of
TrpandMet insome ofouroptimized sequences could introduce potential sites ofoxidation and
compromise theviability ofthemutated antibody asacommercial product. Inanactual drug dis-
covery campaign, onecould exclude Met andTrpinthemutation scans. Inourcase, exclusion of
those amino acids would have resulted intheselection ofother single mutants among thetop50.
Atthispoint wedon't know whether theresulting mutants would have produced comparable
affinity enhancements forbH1 against VEGF. However, wenote that thebest bH1 andherceptin
triple mutants against HER2 contain neither TrpnorMet. Hence, theplatform iscapable of
achieving affinity enhancements without theintroduction ofTrporMet mutations.
Conclusions
Wehave presented ADAPT, acombined interleaved computational and experimental protocol
and workflow foraffinity maturation ofantibodies. Wesummarize themain results below.
1.Anexhaustive virtual scan ofsingle mutants followed byexperimental validation ofselected
single mutants avoids thecombinatorial explosion inexploring multi-site mutations.
2.Validation atthesingle mutation stage improves therobustness and efficiency ofdesigning
double and triple mutations, leading toincreased binding affinities inthree testsystems of
about 100-, 50-and 30-fold, respectively. Ittook lessthan 40mutants foreach system to
achieve these improvements. 100% ofdouble and triple mutants showed affinity improve-
ments versus their parent molecules. The success rate across allmutants was90%.
3.Reasonable additivity ofthecontribution tobinding free energy ofmutations wasobserved.
4.Electrostatics isamajor butnotexclusive contributor toenhanced affinity. Examples of
mutations tonon-polar groups that improve affinity were also observed.
5.Enhanced binding ofthedesigned mutants wasachieved byincreasing thebinding on-rate,
decreasing theoff-rate oracombination ofboth. This canarise from acombination of
long-range electrostatics with short-range non-polar interactions.

mostly affinity-enhancing mutations willbeofgreat value tothedevelopment, calibration
and validation ofcomputational tools forantibody design.
The tight interleaving ofvirtual mutations and experimental validation gives risetothesuc-
cess ofADAPT, which promises tobeauseful platform foraffinity maturation ofantibodies.
While thisstrategy hasbeen validated onaffinity maturation onecanenvision expanding the
applicability domain ofADAPT towards theoptimization ofother important biophysical
properties along with other biotherapeutic frameworks.
Methods
Structure preparation
The initial structures ofthebH1-VEGF, bH1-HER2 andHerceptin-HER2 complexes were
based onthecrystal structures 3bdy, 3be1 and1n8z, respectively. Only theVHandVLregions
oftheFabwere used inthesimulations. From theHER2 extracellular domain, allresidues N-
terminal toCys489 were deleted toreduce thesizeoftheantigen forthecalculations. HER2 res-
idues 581±590 arenotvisible ineither 3be1 or1n8z. The missing loop wasreconstructed by
grafting intheloop from thecrystal structure 1n8y. Crystallographic water andcounterions
were removed. Hydrogen atoms were added andprotonation states atneutral pHwere adopted.
Polar hydrogen orientations were visually examined andmanually adjusted asneeded. Struc-
tural refinement wasthen carried outbyenergy-minimization using theAMBER force-field
[13±15], with adistance-dependent dielectric (4rij)and infinite cutoff fornon-bonded interac-
tions. Non-hydrogen atoms were restrained attheir crystallographic positions with aharmonic
force constant of5kcal/(mol.A2).
Building andscoring mutants
Weused three protocols (SIE-SCWRL, FoldX and Rosetta) formodeling mutants and scoring
their binding affinities. Foreach ofthese protocols, additional refinement oftheAMBER-
refined parent structure wascarried outasprescribed byeach ofthemethods asastarting
point forbuilding and scoring themutants. Wedescribe each ofthese methods briefly below.
Amore detailed description oftheprocedures canbefound inSulea etal.[12]
SIE-SCWRL. This isahybrid method. SCWRL version 4.0(Fox Chase Cancer Center,
Philadelphia, PA;http://dunbrack.fccc.e du/scwrl4) [16] wasused tobuild and repack the
mutant side chains, keeping therestofthecomplex fixed. The resulting SCWRL-generated
structures ofthemutants were then energy-minimized with theAMBER force-field [13±15],
allowing only asetofresidues 6Åaround themutated residue tobemobile. The Fv-antigen
interaction wasscored with theSIE[17,18] function. SIEwasoriginally developed forpredict-
ingbinding affinities ofsmall molecules with proteins. Weusethescoring function here with
noalteration ofitsdefault parameters.
FoldX. Two types ofscores were calculated with FoldX version 3.0b6 (Center forGeno-
mic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain; http://foldx.crg.es) [19,20], Fv-antigen binding affinity
scores and Fvstability scores. The RepairPDB routine ofFoldX wasused toprepare arelaxed
structure ofthecomplex prior tomutation. Default parameters were used throughout along
with setting theionic strength to0.1M.FoldX wasused torepack mutated side chains, keeping
thebackbone fixed. Side chains inthevicinity ofthemutations were also repacked. Binding
affinities were calculated using theFOLDEF [19,20] scoring function. The stability oftheiso-
lated mutant Fvrelative totheparent wasalso estimated. Any mutant Fvthat waspredicted to
bemore than 100-fold lessstable than theparent wasexcluded from consideration byall

identical results foreach run, tenindependent runs were carried outforeach mutant and a

Rosetta. Weused Rosetta software version 3.5(University ofWashington, Seattle, WA;
http://www.rosettacommons.o rg)[21,22] torepack and relax only themutated side chain ina
rigid protein environment. The default weights oftheTalaris 2013 scoring function wasused
fortherepacking and relaxation step, followed byrescoring ofbinding affinity with amodified
function, Talaris-interface, whose weights were optimized foralanine scanning mutations
(https://guybrush.ucsf.edu/benc hmarks/benchmarks/alanine_sca nning) [22].

zixi",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to optimize the binding affinity of antibodies and other biologics through a focused set of mutations with a high likelihood of improving binding.,"Research hypothesis: By using the ADAPT platform, it is hypothesized that a focused set of mutations can be designed to optimize the binding affinity of antibodies and other biologics, resulting in significant improvements in binding affinity for a range of antibody-antigen systems.

Research proposal: The proposed research aims to use the ADAPT platform to design and validate a set of mutations that will enhance the binding affinity of antibodies and other biologics. This will involve an exhaustive virtual scan of single mutants, followed by experimental validation of selected mutants to avoid the combinatorial explosion in exploring multi-site mutations.

The success of this research will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of biologic therapeutics."

Abstract
Mixtures of some pairs of monoclonal antibodies that have separate epitopes on the beta-subunit of hCG have increased affinity for the hormone relative to that of either antibody alone. A mathematical model developed to explain the phenomenon predicted that a circular tetrameric complex composed of each antibody and two molecules of hCG was responsible for the effect. This structure has now been identified experimentally by the following criteria: 1) the m.w. of the complex observed by electrophoresis (370,000 g/mol) and gel filtration (440,000 g/mol) was in agreement with the m.w. expected for a tetramer composed of two molecules of antibody and two molecules of hCG (i.e., 376,000 g/mol); 2) the ratio of individual antibodies to hCG measured with the use of 131I and 125I-labeled antibodies and/or hCG was 1:1:2; and 3) the complex failed to adhere to affinity columns containing either antibodies or hCG covalently coupled to Sepharose. These columns adsorbed B101, B102, hCG, and mixtures of B101 plus hCG or B102 plus hCG. The observations made with the affinity resins are compatible with a circular model for antigen-antibody complex in which the epitopes of the antigen and the binding site of the antibodies were mutually and completely obscured. Although not studied in detail, a similar complex was formed when the beta-subunit of hCG was substituted for the intact hormone. In addition, a mixture of antibodies that bound to the alpha- and beta-subunits of hCG (i.e., A102 and B102) and that had a higher affinity for the hormone than either antibody also gave rise to a similar species that could be detected after electrophoresis. A pair of antibodies that bind to separate epitopes on the beta-subunit (i.e., B101 and B103) and do not show enhanced affinity for hCG failed to form a stable complex that could be identified as a separate species after electrophoresis. Thus, the studies reported here confirm earlier theoretical predictions linking the increase in affinity observed on mixing monoclonal antibodies to the formation of a circular complex.

Accept",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the formation and properties of a circular antibody-antigen complex responsible for increased affinity shown by mixtures of monoclonal antibodies to human chorionic gonadotropin.,"Research Hypothesis: The formation of a circular tetrameric complex composed of monoclonal antibodies and two molecules of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is responsible for the increased affinity observed in mixtures of monoclonal antibodies to hCG.

Research Proposal: To investigate the formation and properties of the circular antibody-antigen complex responsible for the increased affinity shown by mixtures of monoclonal antibodies to hCG, we propose to conduct experimental studies to confirm the presence of the complex and characterize its structure and binding properties. This will involve techniques such as electrophoresis, gel filtration, and affinity column assays to validate the existence of the complex and understand its molecular composition and interaction with hCG."
"The idea to deploy the immune system as a tool to treat 
neoplastic disease originated in the nineteenth century1. 
Wilhelm Busch and Friedrich Fehleisen were the first 
to describe an epidemiological association between 
immune status and cancer. They noticed spontaneous regression of tumours following the development of erysipelas, a superficial skin infection most commonly 
caused by Streptococcus pyogenes
1. Later, William Coley, 
often called the ‘Father of Cancer Immunotherapy’ , retro­spectively demonstrated that erysipelas was associated  
with a better outcome in patients with sarcoma
2. With 
hopes of prospectively verifying his epidemiological evi­dence, Coley treated patients with cancer with extracts 
of heat­inactivated S. pyogenes and Serratia marcescens  
to boost immunity
3. This extract, termed ‘Coley’s tox­
ins’ , possessed potent immunostimulatory properties 
and achieved favourable responses in various cancers2. 
However, lack of scientific rigour and reproducibility, in concert with the discovery of radiotherapy and chemo­
therapeutic agents, prevented treatment with ‘Coley’s toxins’ from becoming standard practice
1.
The concept of cancer immunotherapy resurfaced 
in the twentieth century and made significant headway with the advent of new technology. In 1909, Paul Ehrlich hypothesized that the human body constantly gen  erates 
neoplastic cells that are eradicated by the immune 
sys tem
3. Lewis Thomas and Sir Frank Macfarlane  
Burnet independently conceived the ‘cancer immuno­surveillance’ hypothesis, stating that tumour ­associated 
neoantigens  are recognized and targeted by the immune system to prevent carcinogenesis in a manner similar to 
graft rejection1. Productive immune responses following 
tumoural adoptive transfer in mice4 and clinical reports 
of spontaneous regression of melanoma in patients with 
concomitant autoimmune disease5 provided additional 
evidence supporting this hypothesis, although a unifying mechanism was elusive. The advent of knockout mouse 
models provided the necessary technology to experi ­
mentally demonstrate a link between immunodeficiency and cancer
6. Additional molecular and biochemical 
advances led to the identification of tumour ­specific 
immune responses7. This provided unequivocal evi ­
dence that the immune system, in particular T cells (see 
Box  1 and Fig. 1), was capable of waging war on cancer 
tissue7. Cancer immunotherapy has now revolutionized 
the field of oncology by prolonging survival of patients 
with rapidly fatal cancers. The number of patients eligi­
ble for immune­based cancer treatments continues to skyrocket as these therapies position themselves as the first line for many cancer indications. Novel treatment 
combinations and newly identified druggable targets will 
only expand the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer in the decades to come.
In this Review, we emphasize the role of T cells in 
modern cancer immunotherapies and discuss three dif­ferent categories of immunotherapeutic approaches to treat cancer: 
immune checkpoint  blockade, an approach 
that is designed to ‘unleash’ powerful T cell responses; 
adoptive cellular therapies, which are based on the infu­
sion of tumour ­fighting immune cells into the body; and Neoantigens
Antigens not expressed by 
self-tissues under normal 
conditions that manifest in  
the context of pathology; in cancer, these could be altered 
proteins/peptides encoded by 
mutated genes.

Abstract | The T lymphocyte, especially its capacity for antigen-directed cytotoxicity, has become  
a central focus for engaging the immune system in the fight against cancer. Basic science 
discoveries elucidating the molecular and cellular biology of the T cell have led to new strategies 
in this fight, including checkpoint blockade, adoptive cellular therapy and cancer vaccinology. 
This area of immunological research has been highly active for the past 50 years and is now 
enjoying unprecedented bench-to-bedside clinical success. Here, we provide a comprehensive 
historical and biological perspective regarding the advent and clinical implementation of 
cancer immunotherapeutics, with an emphasis on the fundamental importance of T lymphocyte regulation. We highlight clinical trials that demonstrate therapeutic efficacy and toxicities 
associated with each class of drug. Finally , we summarize emerging therapies and emphasize the 
yet to be elucidated questions and future promise within the field of cancer immunotherapy.

cancer vaccines, which can be designed to have either 
prophylactic or therapeutic activity. Finally, we intro­
duce some of the emerging targets and approaches in 
cancer immunotherapy.
Immune checkpoint therapy
Several evolutionarily conserved negative regulators of T cell activation act as ‘checkpoint molecules’ to 
fine­tune the immune response and regulate hyperacti­
vation. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD1) are the most potent examples of T cell immune checkpoint molecules. They 
exert their biological effect at distinct body sites and 
times during the T cell lifespan
8. Therefore, they com ­
plement each other functionally and ensure that T cell 
responses preserve self­tolerance while effectively pro­
tecting the body from pathogens and neoplasia. CTLA4 and PD1 have been successfully targeted by several pio­neering research groups as treatments for a wide variety 
of recalcitrant cancers, research that ultimately earned 
James P . Allison and Tasuku Honjo the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.CTLA4 biological function. After the discovery of T cell 
co­stimulation mediated by the surface protein CD28 
(Box  1), the search for additional immune regulators led 
to the identification of CTLA4, a receptor with struc­
tural and biochemical similarities to CD28, as a new 
immunoglobulin superfamily  member9,10. The CTLA4 and 
CD28 genes are found in the same region of chromo­
some 2 (2q33.2) and are selectively expressed in the haematopoietic compartment
11. However, in contrast 
to the high levels of basal CD28 expression on conven­
tional T cells, CTLA4 is expressed at a low basal level 
and is strongly induced following antigen activation. Interestingly, CD4
+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which 
have an immunosuppressive function, express CTLA4 
constitutively. Structurally, both CTLA4 and CD28 form 
membrane­bound homodimers comprising an extra­cellular immunoglobulin­like domain, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail capable of recruiting sig ­
nalling proteins and controlling surface expression
10,12,13. 
The trafficking of CTLA4­containing vesicles to the 
cell surface after activation is controlled by a physical 
interaction with the lipopolysaccharide­responsive and Box 1 | T cell function, development, activation and fate
The 1960s represented a period of enlightenment within the field of 
immunology because two major subtypes of lymphocytes, b lymphocytes 
and T lymphocytes, were characterized264, 265. This was recognized by the 
2019 lasker Award for basic Science, awarded for the pioneering work 
by Jacques A. F . P . miller and max Dale Cooper that defined the key roles 
of T cells and B cells in adaptive immunity. B cells recognize circulating antigen in its native form and respond by secreting protective anti­bodies
266. By contrast, T cells recognize peptide antigens, derived from 
proteins degraded intracellularly, that are loaded onto cell surface mHC 
molecules, a process called antigen presentation. Two broad classes  
of T cells that have distinct effector mechanisms are delineated by the expression of either the CD4 or CD8 co­receptor: CD4
+ T cells detect 
antigen in the context of mHC class II molecules and orchestrate the 
adaptive arm of the immune system by producing cytokines with 
chemo  tactic, pro­inflammatory and immunoprotective properties267. 
At least one CD4+ T cell subclass, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, dampens 
the immune response following challenge268. CD8+ T cells detect antigen 
in the context of mHC class I molecules and carry out direct cytotoxic 
reactions that kill infected or neoplastic cells269.
A unique clone­specific cell surface protein complex, the T cell 
receptor (TCr), specifically recognizes antigens and participates in the 
developmental selection of T cells that can recognize pathogens but are 
self­tolerant270. The TCr complex comprises highly polymorphic single 
α­ and β­glycoprotein chains (a small T cell population harbours γ­ and 
δ­chains instead) that contain variable and constant regions, akin to 
immunoglobulins, and a group of non­polymorphic signalling chains, called CD3 γ, δ, ε and ζ. A vast repertoire of T cell clonotypes with unique 
specificities is generated through rearrangement of α­ and β­chain 
gene segments within the genome of each T cell
271. Following clonotype 
production, positive and negative thymic selection functions to entrain  
a ‘tolerant’ immune system, one that efficiently responds to pathogens  
or cancer cells but generally ignores or ‘tolerates’ self­tissues as non­immunogenic
269, 270.
Antigen stimulation of the TCR is necessary for T cell activation and 
proliferation, but an additional signal, termed co­stimulation, is required 
for phosphorylation events crucial for early signal transduction272. The non­  
polymorphic surface protein CD28 and its family members are the most 
potent co­stimulatory receptors on T cells, as elegantly demonstrated by the synergism of anti­CD28 stimulatory antibodies and TCR engagement 
on T cell activation and proliferation
273, 274. Additional evidence was provided by studies demonstrating the efficient inhibition of T cell acti vation and proliferation by inhibitory anti­CD28 antibodies
275– 278.  
The ligands for CD28, B7­1 and B7­2, are expressed on antigen­presenting  
cells and are upregulated when these cells encounter microorganisms 
that activate Toll­like receptors or other pathogen sensors279, 280. Inhibitory 
molecules, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte­associated protein 4 (CTlA4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD1), are induced during immune 
responses and represent a ‘checkpoint’ to dampen T cell hyperactivation
281 
(see Fig. 2). The polymorphic TCr signals through a complex of three 
sets of dimeric CD3 chains, ε–δ, γ–δ and ζ– ζ282. The intracellular portions 
of the CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine­based activation motifs that are phosphorylated by lymphocyte­specific protein kinase 
(lCK), a SrC family kinase
283. At rest, the surface signalling protein CD45 
exhibits phosphatase activity that blocks LCK function284. Following 
activation, CD45 removes an inhibitory phosphate on LCK, permitting 
phosphorylation of ζ chain­associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70), a SYK 
kinase family member that binds to immunoreceptor tyrosine­based activation motifs in the CD3 ζ­chain and recruits the linker for activation of 
T cells (LAT) and phospholipase Cγ 1 (PlCγ )
285. With ample co­stimulation, 
downstream signalling affects calcium release, the activation of the GTPase RAS and transcriptional reprogramming essential for activated 
T cell function
286.
Following activation, circulating naive T cells have three major  
fates in the periphery (Fig.  1). First, the effector T cell population  
can contract through apoptosis as the immune response resolves 
(cytokine withdrawal) or following repeated high­dose stimulation (restimulation­induced cell death)
287– 289. T cells can also exhibit an 
exhausted phenotype induced by repeated low­dose and low­affinity stimulation, as seen in chronic infections and neoplastic processes
88. 
Lastly, a subset of these effector cells are involved in long­term immunological memory. Memory T cells are primed to react more 
vigorously to the same antigen during a subsequent encounter, making 
them critical mediators of immune recall responses to pathogens 
 
and tumours290. Leveraging the power of technological advances in 
molecular biology, recent single­cell RNA sequencing and epigenomic studies have provided additional molecular insight into T cell fates and 
the corresponding features of immunotherapy­responsive T cells. These 
studies collectively implicate that complex transcriptomic, epigenomic and clonotypic changes of tumour ­infiltrating T cells determine the 
success of immunotherapy

beige­like anchor protein (LRBA)13. The sequence simi­
larity between CTLA4 and CD28 is highest within their 
extracellular binding domain and they therefore bind 
to the same ligands, called B7­1 (also known as CD80) and B7­2 (also known as CD86), which are expressed by 
antigen-presenting cells  (APCs; Box  1). However, CTLA4 
has greater affinity and avidity than CD28 for B7 ligands, 
representing a key difference in their biology14–16.
With further characterization, it became clear that 
CD28 and CTLA4 had opposite immunoregulatory 
functions. For example, soluble CTLA4 was shown to inhibit the proliferation of T cells co­cultured with B7­expressing APCs because it interfered with the 
CD28–B7 interaction
14. T cell receptor (TCR) signalling 
studies unequivocally demonstrated that CTLA4 inhib­its T cell activation and proliferation
12,17,18. The negative 
tolerogenic role of CTLA4 was also evident in vivo, because Ctla4 ­knockout mice developed a character ­
istic T cell­mediated lymphoproliferative autoimmune disease
19. The absence of Ctla4 was sufficient to cause 
this phenotype, as treatment with an engineered solu­ble version of a CTLA4:Fc fusion protein (
CTLA4ig ) and 
genetic crosses to B7­deficient mice ameliorated dis­ease
20,21. The autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder 
caused by Ctla4 loss depends on the activity of CD28 because mutation of an LCK­binding carboxy­terminal 
proline motif in the intracellular tail of CD28 abrogates disease in mouse models
22. Moreover, human patients 
with CTLA4 haploinsufficiency exhibit similar severe 
multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration and autoimmunity (CHAI disease) that can be treated with abatacept, an FDA ­approved CTLA4Ig
23,24.
CTLA4 restrains T cell activation through multiple 
mechanisms: by directly antagonizing CD28, by com­peting for co­stimulatory ligands, by preventing immune conjugate formation and by recruiting inhibitory effec­tors

Fig. 1 | Peripheral T cell fates after antigenic activation. Resting T cells become activated after stimulation by cognate 
antigen in the context of an antigen-presenting cell and co-stimulatory signals. Activated T cells produce and consume 
proliferative/survival cytokines, for example, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-7 , and begin to expand in number. If CD4+CD25+ regulatory  
T (Treg) cells are present, they can deprive the cycling T cells of proliferative/survival cytokines, especially IL-2, causing  
them to undergo apoptosis. Once cells are proliferating rapidly , they have different fates depending on their environment. 
If they receive acute strong antigenic stimulation, especially if it is encountered repeatedly , the cells will undergo 
restimulation-induced cell death. By contrast, if they receive chronic weak antigenic stimulation, the cells will survive  
but become reprogrammed into a specific unresponsive transcriptional state known as ‘T cell exhaustion’. Finally , as the 
antigen and cytokine stimulation diminishes as the immune response wanes, usually once the pathogen has been cleared, cytokine withdrawal can occur passively to contract the expanded population of antigen-specific T cells. A small fraction 
of cells will be reprogrammed to enter a ‘memory’ phenotype, and this differentiation step is facilitated by IL-7 and IL-15. 
Memory T cells will continue to persist in the immune system and form the basis of anamnestic responses. In these regulatory processes, T cell death usually takes the form of apoptosis.

where it associates with the TCR26. In the context of the 
immunological synapse, CTLA4 can also reorganize  
the cytoskeleton and disturb T cell–APC immune conjugate   
formation27. CTLA4 also mediates the internaliza­
tion of its ligands, thereby preventing their binding to 
CD28, which, in turn, reduces iL-2 secretion and T cell 
proliferation17,28,29. Lastly, phosphatases, including SH2 
domain­containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), are recruited and inter ­
act with the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA4, thereby contrib ­
uting to its negative effect on T cell activation. SHP2 is 
an inhibitor of phosphorylation of the CD3 ζ­subunit 
of the TCR and also inhibits phosphorylation of the 
adaptor protein  linker of activated T cells (LAT)30,31. PP2A 
is hypothesized to inhibit extracellular signal­regulated kinase (ERK), a kinase that acts as a signalling protein 
downstream of the TCR
32. However, there is significant 
debate about which of the molecules that associate with 
the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA4 are most important for 
inhibiting T cell activity. Nevertheless, these inhibitory signals reduce the activation of transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP ­1), nuclear factor ­κB 
(NF­κB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), 
which reprogrammes T cells towards an anergic fate
29,33.
Beyond its function in activated conventional 
T cells, CTLA4 expression on Treg cells is essential for 
the direct and indirect immunosuppressive activity 
of these cells34,35. In vitro studies showed that CTLA4 
was necessary for anti­inflammatory cytokine release by T
reg cells, which reduces polyclonal activation 
and proliferation of conventional T cells nearby36,37.  
This result was confirmed in vivo by adoptive trans fer 
of CTLA4­bearing Treg cells to prevent auto  immunity 
induced by CTLA4­deficient T cells that had been 
transferred to T cell­ and B cell­deficient mice (Rag–/– 
mice)38,39. This treatment effect was nullified by 
antibody­mediated neutralization of CTLA4 (reFS38,40,41). 
Thus, Treg cell­expressed CTLA4 can compensate for 
lack of CTLA4 expression by conventional T cells42,43.

Fig. 2 | Mechanisms of T cell activation and regulation. Before activation, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) load antigen 
onto MHC molecules to prepare for contact with a T cell that displays a cognate T cell receptor (TCR) while also providing 
necessary co-stimulatory ligands B7-1 and B7-2. The inhibitory molecule cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) is contained within intracellular vesicles in naive T cells, whereas it is constitutively expressed on the cell surface of CD4
+CD25+ 
regulatory T (Treg) cells. Both classes of T cells express the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Early after activation, generally in 
the lymphoid tissue, T cells are activated when their TCRs bind to their cognate antigen presented by APCs in conjunction with CD28 binding to B7-1/B7-2. Also, the activated T cells begin the process of displaying CTLA4 on the cell surface. T cells within peripheral tissues upregulate PD1 at the mRNA level early after activation. Late after activation, in lymphoid tissue, 
CTLA4 expressed by activated T cells binds to the B7-1 and B7-2 molecules on APCs, thereby preventing their binding to CD28 and promoting anergy by decreasing the T cell activation state. At the same time, constitutive expression of CTLA4  
on T
reg cells leads to trans-endocytosis of B7 ligands and interferes with the CD28 co-stimulatory ability of APCs. Late after  
activation in peripheral tissues, PD1 is further upregulated transcriptionally , leading to greater surface expression of 
programmed cell death 1 (PD1), which binds to its ligands PDL1 and PDL2, thereby promoting T cell exhaustion at sites of infection or when confronted with neoplasms. Image courtesy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

CTLA4 blockade in cancer. The recognition of CTLA4 as a negative regulator of T cell activation gave rise to the idea that blocking its actions could unleash a therapeutic response of T cells against cancer
45 (Fig.  3). James Allison 
and colleagues first tested this idea and demonstrated 
that neutralizing anti­CTLA4 antibodies enhanced 
antitumoural immunity in mice against transplanted and established colon carcinoma and fibrosarcoma
46. 
In addition, during rechallenge, animals treated with 
anti­CTLA4 were able to rapidly eliminate tumour cells 
through immune mechanisms, providing evidence that blocking of CTLA4 induces long­lasting immunologi­cal memory
46,47. Although CTLA4­targeted mono­
therapy was shown to confer benefit in animal models 
of brain48, ovarian49, bladder50, colon46, prostate47 and soft 
tissue46 cancers, less immunogenic cancers, including 
SM1 mammary carcinoma51 and B16 melanoma52, did 
not respond as favourably. Furthermore, heterogeneity between cancer models yielded discordant tissue­specific 
results
45,53. In addition, a greater tumour burden corre­
lated with reduced tumour responses to anti­CTLA4 
treatment because larger tumours foster a more robust 
anti­inflammatory tumour microenvironment45,49.
Despite the mixed success in preclinical studies, 
mAbs targeting CTLA4 proved effective in clinical trials of melanoma
45. Ipilimumab, a human IgG1κ 
anti­CTLA4 mAb, gained FDA approval in 2011 for 
non­resectable stage III/IV melanoma following evi ­
dence that it elicited potent tumour necrosis54 and 
conferred a 3.6 ­month short­ term survival benefit55. 
Long­term survival data demonstrated that 22% of patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipili­
mumab benefited from an additional 3 years or more of life
56. Additional long­term studies have demonstrated 
the durability of this survival benefit, indicating the per ­
sistence of antitumoural immunity following CTLA4 blockade
56,57. Unfortunately, trial results in renal cell 
carcinoma58, non­small­cell lung cancer59, small­cell 
lung cancer60 and prostate cancer61 have yielded less 
impressive effects than those seen in patients with 
melanoma. Tremelimumab, an IgG2 isotype form of 
a CTLA4­blocking antibody, has yet to receive FDA approval as it did not increase survival in advanced melanoma
62. It is hypothesized that effectiveness varies 
between ipilimumab and tremelimumab owing to dif­
ferences in binding kinetics and the capacity to mediate 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity63,64.
The mechanisms of CTLA4 ­mediated tumour regres ­
sion are pleiotropic but unified by the action of one cell 
type, the T lymphocyte (Fig.  3). T cell responses are nec­
essary for the therapeutic effects of CTLA4­targeted 
agents because T cell depletion in animal models 
abolishes tumoricidal activity65. Inhibition of CTLA4 
enhances T cell clonal responses to tumour ­associated 
neoantigens and a high neoantigen burden portends a favourable response to anti­CTLA4 therapy
66,67. Apart 
from boosting effector T cell responses, anti­CTLA4 therapy depletes local intratumoural Treg cells through 
antibody­dependent cell­mediated cytotoxicity in 
mouse models and shifts the balance of the tumour 
microenvironment away from immunosuppression68,69. 
This phenomenon requires further study in human can­
cer as current data are inconclusive70,71. The relative role 
of effector T cells and Treg cells in conferring a clinical 
benefit has been contested, although specific blocking of CTLA4 in both cell populations can lead to synergistic 
increases in tumour regression
69. Overall, current data 
suggest that the most critical factor in predicting out­
come is the ratio of effector T cells to Treg cells infiltrating 
the tumour45,49.
PD1/PDL1 biological function. PD1 was first identified 
in 1992 as a putative mediator of apoptosis, although later evidence suggested a role in restraining immune system hyperactivation, analogous to CTLA4 
(reF.72). As a  
type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein within the immuno­
globulin superfamily, PD1 exhibits a 20% and 15% Antibody-dependent

T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)-blocking antibodies

Human PD1 is expressed on T cells after TCR stimula­

ligands as the ‘PD1 axis’ . The predominant role of the PD1 axis in the negative regulation of T cell activation

strain exhibited cardiac inflammation leading to dilated cardiomyopathy
79. By comparison, non-obese diabetic  
Pdcd1–/– mice had accelerated type 1 diabetes mellitus 
compared with their Pdcd1 ­sufficient counterparts80. 
The heterogeneous and late­onset autoimmune pheno­types of Pdcd1
–/– mice were distinct from Ctla4–/– ani­
mals, demonstrating that the PD1 axis regulates T cell biology differently to CTLA4. Spatially, CTLA4 exerts 
its regulatory effect predominantly within lymphoid organs, whereas PD1 tends towards tempering T cell activation locally within peripheral tissues
8. Temporally, PD1 acts later in the course of T cell activation and fate determination. Overall, the PD1 axis plays a unique role 
in maintaining T cell tolerance to self.
PD1 restrains immune responses primarily through 
inhibitory intracellular signalling in effector T cells and 
T
reg cells81. The immunoreceptor tyrosine- based switch motif  
and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif  of 
PD1 are phosphorylated and recruit the phosphatases 
SHP1 and SHP2, which dephosphorylate, and thereby 
inactivate, downstream effectors (that is, the CD3 ζ­subunit and ZAP70) that are important for early 
T cell activation
76 and CD28 signalling82. Both CTLA4 
and PD1 inhibit protein kinase B (PKB; also known as 
AKT) signalling to reduce glucose uptake and utiliza­
tion, the former through PP2A and the latter by reducing phosphoinositide 3­kinase (PI3K) activity
83. In contrast 
to CTLA4, the PD1 axis is essential for controlling the 
continued activation and proliferation of differentiated 
effectors; when PD1 engages its ligands, it can induce a state of T cell dysfunction called 
T cell exhaustion84–86. 
However, what determines whether PD1 mediates 
exhaustion or apoptosis in certain contexts is still an 
active area of research. One model suggests that the interaction between PI3K signalling and the mito­chondrial B cell lymphoma­extra large (BCL ­X
L) pro ­
tein is a critical control point at which PD1 ­mediated 
P13K inhibition reduces BCL ­XL and promotes apop­
tosis25,83. Beyond regulating conventional T cells, 
PDL1 on APCs can control Treg cell differentiation and 
suppressive activity87. Unfortunately, tumour cells can 
exploit this mechanism by upregulating PD1 ligands 
to induce T cell exhaustion and generate a tumour 
microenvironment that facilitates tumour growth and invasion
88.
PD1/PDL1 blockade in cancer. Once the PD1 axis was implicated in the negative regulation of T cells, preclin­ical work examined whether inhibitors of this pathway could be used for cancer treatment and biomarker 
discovery. First, overexpression of PDL1 or PDL2 in  
cancer cell lines was found to constrain the CD8
+ T cell 
cytotoxic antitumour response, whereas tumours were rejected in mice without functional PD1 
(reFS89,90). 
Second, blockade of PD1 suppressed the growth of transplanted myeloma cells in syngeneic animals
90. 
Conversely, transplanted cells overexpressing PDL1 or PDL2 in syngeneic mice allowed for increased tumour 
colonization, burden and invasiveness
90. Neutralizing 
the PD1 axis using mAbs89,91 or secreted PD1 extracel­
lular domains92 reversed these effects and enhanced 
T cell cytotoxicity towards tumour cells90 (Fig.  4). 
Rescuing CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity by PD1 blockade 
depends on the expression of CD28 as PD1­mediated 
immunomodulation is lost in the context of CTLA4Ig, 
B7 blockade or CD28 conditional­knockout mice92. In 
addition, reinvigorated T cells in the peripheral blood 
of patients with lung cancer following PD1 blockade  
were shown to express CD28 (reF.93). PD1 inhibition 
not only augments antitumoural immunity but also limits haematogenous seeding of B16 melanoma and 
CT26 colon carcinoma metastases in mouse models
94.

Fig. 4 | Mechanisms of PD1 axis inhibition. Activated T cells express programmed 
cell death 1 (PD1), which engages with its specific ligand (PDL1 or PDL2) to dampen 
activation. Blocking of the PD1 axis through the administration of an anti-PD1 (or anti-PDL1 or anti-PDL2) antibody prevents this inhibitory interaction and unleashes antitumoural T lymphocyte activity by promoting increased T cell activation and proliferation, by enhancing their effector functions and by supporting the formation of memory cells. Consequently , more T cells bind to tumour antigens presented on tumour 
cells by MHC molecules via their T cell receptors (TCRs). This ultimately leads to the release of cytolytic mediators, such as perforin and granzyme, causing enhanced tumour killing.

cytolysis and limit metastasis. Apart from a role of PD1 
and its ligands in cancer treatment, multiple studies 
have also shown a negative correlation between human 
tumour expression of proteins involved in the PD1 axis and prognosis, indicating the utility of these proteins as potential biomarkers
95–97.
Following preclinical success, mAbs designed to 
counteract negative immunoregulation by the PD1 axis were developed and efficacy was shown in clinical tri­als
98. Development was initiated by Medarex (ultimately 
purchased by Bristol ­Myers Squibb) in 2001 (reF.99). In 
2010, a phase I trial demonstrated that PD1 blockade 
was well tolerated and could promote antitumoural 
responses100. In 2014, the humanized and fully human 
anti­PD1 mAbs pembrolizumab and nivolumab (both 
IgG4) became the first FDA ­approved PD1­targeted 
therapeutics for refractory and unresectable mela­
noma101– 104. In a head­to­head comparison, pembroli­
zumab showed better 6­month progression­free survival 
than ipilimumab and conferred an overall survival ben­
efit105,106. Clinical trials of nivolumab demonstrated an 
overall survival of 72.9% at 1 year compared with 42.1% 
survival in the group of patients treated with the chem­
otherapeutic dacarbazine104. In 2015, pembrolizumab 
was approved for the treatment of PDL1­expressing 
non­small­cell lung carcinoma because it provided a 
4.3­month increase in progression ­free survival com ­
pared with platinum­based chemotherapeutics and was more effective than the chemotherapeutic pacli­
taxel
107, 108. Increased PDL1 expression on the target 
tumour was associated with improved responses to PD1 axis blockade
109. Additional successful clinical trials 
expanded the use of pembrolizumab to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
110, Hodgkin lymphoma111, 
urothelial carcinoma112, gastric/gastro­oesophageal junc­
tion cancer113 and tissue­agnostic carcinoma with a high 
degree of microsatellite instability114. Following approval 
in tissue­agnostic cancers with microsatellite instability, pembrolizumab became the first drug to be approved 
based on a molecular biomarker rather than by cancer site. However, the immunosuppressive microenviron ­
ment of different tissues makes it hard to predict which 
patients will benefit
115,116. Similar to prembrolizumab, the 
use of nivolumab has since been extended to renal cell carcinoma
117, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma118, 
urothelial carcinoma119, hepatocellular carcinoma120, 
Hodgkin lymphoma121 and colorectal cancer with a 
high degree of microsatellite instability122. As was seen 
with anti­CTLA4 therapy, long­term survival analyses demonstrate a long­lasting immune­mediated survival 
benefit following PD1 blockade
123. However, the reason 
why PD1 blockade has demonstrated broader clinical 
utility than anti­ CTLA4 treatment has remained elusive. 
It is hypothesized that the difference may be because 
the PD1 axis is frequently co­opted by tumours via ligand expression, whereas CTLA4 represents a broader 
immunoregulatory circuit
74,124.
PDL1 is also targetable by specific antibodies that 
have proven effective treatments in multiple forms of 
cancer. In 2016, the first PDL1­targeted humanized mAb, atezolizumab (an IgG4 antibody), was approved for treatment of urothelial carcinoma. An overall  response rate of 15% was deemed statistically signifi  cant 
based on historical control data, although responses 
were dependent on tumour PDL1 expression status
125.  
Unfortunately, additional trial data have not demon­
strated that atezolizumab has clinical efficacy beyond the 
standard of care in urothelial carcinoma, although it is less toxic than traditional chemotherapy
126. Indications 
have since expanded to include the treatment of non­  
small­cell lung carcinoma127, triple­negative breast 
cancer128 and small­cell lung cancer129. Additional 
anti­PDL1 human mAbs, avelumab and durvalumab, 
entered the market in 2017 (reF.98). Avelumab is used 
for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma130, urothe­
lial carcinoma131 and advanced renal cell carcinoma132. 
Duvalumab is used for urothelial carcinoma133 and 
non­small­ cell lung cancer134. Therefore, similar to PD1, 
blockade of PDL1 has been effective in difficult­to­treat forms of cancer.
Adverse effects of checkpoint blockade. Blocking a natu­
rally occurring central immune checkpoint unleashes 
powerful immune effector mechanisms that may not 
respect the normal boundaries of immune tolerance to self­tissues
135. Ctla4- and Pdcd1 ­knockout mice 
provided a glimpse into the spectrum of autoimmune 
responses that occur in humans during immune check­
point blockade therapy19,77–79. Human loss­of­function 
mutations in CTLA4 and its interacting regulatory pro­
tein, LRBA, also mirror the immune­related side effects 
observed with anti­CTLA4 therapy13,24. On the basis of a 
meta­analysis of trial data sets, immune­related adverse events are estimated to occur in 15–90% of patients
55. 
More severe events requiring intervention are observed in 30% and 15% of patients treated with CTLA4 and PD1 
axis inhibitors, respectively
136. The common immune 
feature of toxicity is the loss of naive T cells and the 
accumulation of overactive memory T cells that invade 
peripheral organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, and cause inflammatory damage. Keratinized and non ­keratinized mucosa appear to be the most 
susceptible, as approximately 68% and 40% of treated patients exhibit pruritis and mucositis, respectively
137,138. 
Anti­CTLA4 therapy carries an increased risk of severe 
autoimmune complications compared with therapies 
targeting the PD1 axis, as was observed in knockout mice and in clinical studies
19,77–80,139. In addition, data 
from dose­escalation trials support the claim that 
anti­CTLA4 agents elicit dose­dependent responses 
not seen with therapies targeted at the PD1 axis107, 139. 
Toxicities affecting the gastrointestinal tract and brain 
are more common with anti­CTLA4 therapy, whereas 
patients treated with PD1 axis ­targeted therapies are 
at higher risk of hypothyroidism, hepatoxicity and pneumonitis
137. However, as the number of indica­
tions treated with checkpoint blockade increases and 
more patients are treated, rarer side effects in a wider 
spectrum of organs and heterogeneous responses have manifested
137. For example, hyperprogression of disease 
has been observed in a minority of patients with vari­
ous tumour types treated with PD1 inhibitors140– 142. Most 
recently, it was shown that the PD1 inhibitor nivolumab can lead to the rapid progression of disease in patients

with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma, providing evi­
dence for a role of tumour ­resident Treg cells in the patho­
genesis of this lymphoma143. Multiple immune­related 
response criteria have been developed to better catego­
rize patient responses to checkpoint blockade. In addi­
tion, these criteria aim to distinguish progression from pseudoprogression, a phenomenon in which patients treated with CTLA4 or PD1 inhibitors experience a  
period of progression followed by rapid tumour clear ­
ance
144,145. Overall, checkpoint blockade leads to auto­
immune toxicities with a therapy­specific pattern of organ  
involvement, as predicted by the phenotypes of animals genetically deficient for checkpoint molecules.
Interestingly, preclinical immune checkpoint ther ­
apy studies did not demonstrate major adverse effects 
in vivo and, thus, were not great predictors of human 
toxicities
146. This is thought to be due to the short time 
frame of these studies and the inbred nature of mouse 
strains146. Recently developed humanized mouse mod­
els represent a platform that better recapitulates side effects due to checkpoint therapy
146, 147. Nevertheless, 
toxicity associated with immune checkpoint blockade is tolerated better than the toxicities associated with 
traditional chemotherapeutics, making these therapies attractive for quality of life reasons beyond their survival benefit
98,148.
Recent research has aimed to improve the side­effect 
profiles and clinical response of immune checkpoint blockade through the modification of existing antibod­ies and the engineering of novel delivery methods. It was recently shown that abnormal CTLA4 recycling and sub ­
sequent lysosomal degradation was a mechanism that contributes to toxicities and reduced drug effectiveness. Modified pH­sensitive antibodies that do not interfere with LRBA ­mediated CTLA4 recycling were shown to 
limit adverse events and improve clinical outcomes in established tumours in mouse models, which may ulti­mately broaden clinical utility
149,150. Additional research 
has focused on developing biomaterials for the localized 
administration of checkpoint inhibitors151. For example, 
compared with systemic delivery, transdermal patch delivery of anti ­PD1 antibodies was better tolerated 
and unleashed a more robust antitumoural response 
in a mouse model of melanoma
151. A broad field of 
research is currently aimed at discovering novel meth­
ods to reduce toxicities associated with checkpoint ther ­
apy and to increase clinical benefit in a greater variety 
of tumours.
Clinical management of drug ­related toxicities is 
the same for all checkpoint drugs, and toxicities are graded according to the 2009 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events severity scale
137, 152. Mild (grade 1) toxicities are not 
typically treated. In the setting of grade 2 or 3 adverse 
events, checkpoint inhibitors are discontinued until 
symptoms and laboratory­value abnormalities resolve. Glucocorticoids are also used to effectively control immune hyperactivity. Infliximab and other immuno­
suppressive agents can be used when glucocorticoids fail. 
Life­threatening (grade 4) toxicities necessitate the com­plete discontinuation of therapy and the use of life ­saving 
measures, as required. Active monitoring of symptoms and laboratory parameters is recommended in order to prevent death due to checkpoint blockade (grade 5).
Current research is aimed at identifying predictive 
biomarkers for organ­specific toxicities due to check­
point therapy. For example, neutrophil activation, as 
measured by increased expression of the biliary glycopro­tein CEACAM1 and the cell surface glycoprotein CD177, correlates with gastrointestinal­related side effects in 
patients treated with ipilimumab
153. Increases in eosino­
phil counts and release of the pro­inflammatory cytokine IL­17 are associated with toxicity regardless of the organ 
affected
154,155. Pharmacogenomic profiling (using genetic 
information to predict responses to drugs) may provide more insight into the relevant genes and pathways medi ­
ating toxicity
137. Ultimately, the hope is that genetic, bio­
chemical or metabolic profiling could either pre­screen or rapidly detect individuals likely to experience the most 
severe adverse reactions to checkpoint therapy.
Adoptive T cell transfer therapy
Adoptive T cell (ATC) therapy, in which autologous or allogenic T cells are infused into patients with cancer, 
has shown considerable promise in recent years. The  
viability of this type of therapy was first shown by 
Southam et al. in 1966, when half of the patients with  
advanced cancer demonstrated tumour regression follow­
ing co­transplantation with patient­derived leuko  cytes  
and autologous tumour cells
156. Allogenic haemato­
poietic stem cell transplants for leukaemia represented  
the first effective adoptive transfer approach deployed 
clinically, and clinical improvement was shown to be mediated by a T cell graft versus tumour response
157.
ATC with tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. ATC ther ­
apy using tumour ­infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for 
the treatment of metastatic melanoma was pioneered at the National Cancer Institute in the late 1980s
158. 
Lymphocytes isolated from a cancer biopsy were 
greatly expanded with IL ­2 and then reinfused intra­
venously into the same patient with a large bolus of 
IL­2. The objective response rate was 34%; however, the 
median duration of response was only 4 months and 
few patients experienced a complete response159. Later 
studies incorporating lymphodepletion before ATC therapy in 93 patients with metastatic melanoma were 
more successful, with complete tumour regression in 20 (22%) patients, 19 of whom were still in complete remission 3 years after treatment
160. The screening and 
enriching for neoantigen­specific TILs, made possible 
by high­throughput technologies, recently demon­
strated promise in a patient with metastatic breast cancer
161. In addition, knockdown of the gene encod ­
ing cytokine­inducible SH2­containing protein (Cish ), 
a negative regulator of TCR signalling, was shown to boost the antitumoural response of ATC therapy in mouse models
162. However, in order for TIL ­based ATC 
therapy to elicit durable responses (Fig.  5), effector T cells 
with antitumour activity must be present in the tumour, 
which is not the case for many cancer types163. Other 
innovative approaches to tweak T cell activity and pro­liferation may allow for a greater palette of treatments 
to be developed.

Engineered lymphocytes for ATC. The challenges asso­
ciated with expanding tumour ­specific T cells in vitro 
led to the development of TCR ­engineered lymphocytes 
(Fig.  5). However, these cells are limited to responding to 
tumour antigens presented by the MHC (also known as 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans) rather than 
surface antigens on tumour cells163. However, synthetic 
chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can bypass MHC 
restriction and direct specific cytotoxicity to a target 
molecule on the surface of the malignant cell. Isolated T cells from the patient (or allogeneic donor) are genet­ically modified to express CARs and then expanded and 
infused into the patient. This overcomes the problem 
that tumour cells often downregulate MHC molecules, which leaves the cell unable to present antigen to con­ventional T cells
164. CARs comprise an antigen­binding 
domain, most often from the variable regions of anti­
bodies, linked to signalling domains of the TCR and 
various co­ stimulatory molecules (Fig.  5). Given the 
domain modularity of cell surface signalling proteins, mixes and matches of extracellular targeting domains 
and internal signal transduction domains can be assem­
bled using protein engineering. This offers many options to tailor CARs to specific tumours. The first generation of CAR T cells relied only on the CD3 ζ­chain to simu­
late TCR signalling
165, but this design was ineffective in 
clinical trials owing to limited T cell proliferation and cytokine production
166, 167. Subsequent generations of 
CAR T cells have been engineered to include domains from CD28, CD40 ligand and other positive regulators 
of T cell activation to potentiate activation and cyto­toxicity in vivo
168– 171. An engineered single­chain PD1 
blocker has also demonstrated similar enhanced effi­
cacy to second­generation CAR T cells with solely a 
CD28 domain172. Even though CAR T cells are typically 
engineered using retroviral transduction, recent work 
has used CRISPR–Cas9 technology. CRISPR–Cas9 can  
be used to edit the TCR germline sequence directly, 
which could lead",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the efficacy and safety of novel engineered single-chain PD1 blocker in enhancing the antitumour activity of CAR T cells in preclinical models of cancer.,"Research hypothesis: We hypothesize that the use of novel engineered single-chain PD1 blocker in combination with adoptive cellular therapy, specifically CAR T cells, will enhance the antitumour activity and efficacy of the treatment in preclinical models of cancer.

Research proposal: The proposed study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of the novel engineered single-chain PD1 blocker in enhancing the antitumour activity of CAR T cells in preclinical models of cancer. The study will involve the isolation and genetic modification of T cells to express CARs targeting specific tumour antigens, followed by expansion and infusion of the engineered T cells into preclinical models of cancer. The study will assess the antitumour activity, proliferation, and cytokine production of the engineered T cells, as well as the safety and potential adverse effects of the treatment. The goal is to provide evidence supporting the use of the novel engineered single-chain PD1 blocker in combination with adoptive cellular therapy as a potential treatment strategy for cancer."

Antibody conjugated Nanoparticles (AcNPs), edge-cutting technologies thatarepresent in
several novel biomedical approaches forimaging, detection andtreatment ofdiseases.
However, thenano-confinement inAcNPs andLBA nanostructures introduces extra com-
plexity intheanalysis ofligand-recep torequilibriums. Because antibodies arelarge volumi-
nous ligands, theeffective affinity inAcNPs isoften determined byantibody orientation and
surface coverage. Moreover, antibodies have twobinding sites introducing anextra ligand-
receptor binding equilibrium. Asconsequence ofallthis, experimental ortheoretical studies

receptor binding onAcNPs, wehave used amolecular theory thatpredicts theprobability of

have considered twodifferent pathways fordesigning these devices: covalently conjugated
antibodies andstreptavidin-biotin conjugated antibodies. Wealso explore theeffects ofsur-

thepharmaceutical industry, around 70% ofthetotal sales ofdrugs totreat cancer [5]and
autoimmune diseases [6]aretherapies based onthebinding ofantibodies (the ligands) to
specific receptors. The main feature ofligand-receptor binding that makes this interaction
soattractive foravariety ofapplications isthat itdisplays high specificity and high affinity.
Forexample, antibodies only bind strongly totheir respective complementary epitopes
(high selectivity), with typical antibody-antigen dissociation constants (Kd) intherange of
10−8to10−11M(high affinity) [7].Due tothese characteristics thebiomedical research field
hasintroduce several techniques that exploit ligand-receptor interactions. Inparticular, we
canmention ligand-binding assays (LBA) that useligands todetect, totarget ortomeasure a
specific receptor [1±3].
During thelastdecade, theproduction ofLBA combined with nanoparticles (NPs) has
increased duetothepotential forin-vivo and in-vitro imaging and detection ofdifferent ana-
lytes, aswell asforspecific therapies such asthermal-ablation, gene therapy orlocalized drug
delivery with nano-carriers [8±13]. However, nanoparticle mediated ligand-receptor binding
displays aparticularly complex behavior that arises from theconfinement ofthemolecular
species onasmall surface. The chemical equilibrium between ligands and receptors canbe
locally displaced according totheinhomogeneous concentration ofthespecies, which results
inaneffective affinity that highly depends onthelocal environment and thenature ofthecon-
finement. Forthat, predicting oftheoutcome behavior ofLBA innano-structures represents a
challenging task that requires thecollection ofextensive experimental data and/or theoretical
calculations.
The vast majority ofnovel LBA platforms include NPs modified with antibodies asligands
molecules. These antibody-conjugated nanoparticles (AcNPs) take advantage ofthehigh affin-
ityand selectivity ofantibodies [5,6,14]incombination with thelarge surface-area/volume
ratio offered byNPs. However, asmentioned before, confinement modifies theeffective anti-
body-receptor affinity, which ishighly dependent onthelocal environment. Toaddanextra
layer ofcomplexity, theeffective affinity inAcNPs isoften determined bytheorientation and
density ofantibodies onthesurface, since these molecules arelarge voluminous ligands. More-
over, antibodies have twopossible binding sites, which introduces anadditional ligand-recep-
torbinding equilibrium.
Some experimental works onAcNP- and LBA-related systems have investigated thebind-
ingbehavior asafunction ofantibody surface coverage [15±20]. These studies have shown
that AcNPs ligand-receptor binding displays anon-monotonic behavior asafunction ofthe
number ofantibodies onthesurface. Asthesurface coverage ofantibodies isincreased, the
amount ofcaptured antigen reaches amaximum atlowsurface coverage and then decays
into aplateau athigh surface coverage. This non-monotonic behavior inthebinding capac-
ityisgenerally hypothesized asbeing theconsequence oftheincreasing influence ofsurface
crowding. Some theoretical works have focused onunderstanding theconcentration depen-
dence ofthis binding [21], butthey have notconclusively explained thenon-monotonic
behavior inAcNPs.
Ligand-receptor binding inLBA and AcNPs isfavored bythedecrease inchemical free
energy, particularly when theaffinity ishigh. Incontrast, oncrowded surfaces with volumi-
nous ligands, several entropic contributions tothefree energy oppose thisbinding (e.g., the
entropic lossduetoligand immobilization). This decrease inentropy upon binding isparticu-
larly relevant ifthenano-environment near thesurface issufficiently crowded. Inthiswork,
wewillshow that ligand-receptor binding with voluminous molecules such asantibodies
results from thecompetition between binding and opposing entropic effects induced bysur-
face crowding.

Methods
Our theoretical methodology isbased onapreviously developed molecular theory [15±20].
The predictions ofthistheory have been shown tobeingood agreement with experimental
observations forligand-receptor binding inpolymer layers [20, 23,24,27]. This method
explicitly accounts forthevolume and conformations ofthemolecular species including the
antibody, antigen and antibody-antigen complexes, and predicts theamount ofbinding
depending onlocal environment. Application ofthistheory requires theinput ofthedifferent
molecular conformations ofthesystem. Todescribe theantibody, weuseacoarse-grained
model based onthecrystallographic data ofanti-HIV-1 b12monoclonal antibody [30] and its
complex with HIV gp120 [31]. Forthebinding oftwoantigens totheantibody wehave used a
ratio affinity/avidity extracted from experimental results onb12antibody [32]. The dissocia-
tion constant range isbased ontheexperimental work ofLandry etal[7]that suggest aKd
range of10−8to10−11Mfordifferent antibody/antigens. Each amino acid inthestructure is
represented byasingle bead of0.6nmdiameter, centered atthealpha carbon ofthecorre-
sponding residue. The spacer conformation isbased onacoarse-grain model ofpoly(ethylene-
glycol) (PEG) where each bead (diameter =0.6nm) represents amonomeric unit (EG). The
antibody structure isfixed initsinitial conformation obtained from thePDB, buthasfull
three-dimensional rotational and translational freedom. Conformations ofthespacer aregen-
erated using arotational isomeric state model [33]. Streptavidin isconsidered aspunctual

RNPdrr2ρwrnvρwrjw",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the binding behavior of ligand-receptor interactions on crowded surfaces using antibody-conjugated nanoparticles.,"Research Hypothesis:
The binding behavior of ligand-receptor interactions on crowded surfaces using antibody-conjugated nanoparticles can be investigated by considering the molecular theory that predicts the probability of different molecular conformations of the system depending on the local environment. The hypothesis is that the effective affinity in antibody-conjugated nanoparticles is determined by antibody orientation, surface coverage, nanoparticle size, and antibody-antigen affinity.

Research Proposal:
To investigate the binding behavior of ligand-receptor interactions on crowded surfaces using antibody-conjugated nanoparticles, we propose to use a molecular theory that accounts for the conformations and chemical information of the molecules involved, including a detailed description of the antibody's three-dimensional structure. The proposal involves studying the molecular origin of the non-monotonic binding behavior in antibody-conjugated nanoparticles and predicting the optimal surface coverage for different system configurations as a function of several variables. Additionally, we aim to evaluate two different designs for antibody conjugation to the nanoparticles: covalently grafted antibodies and antibodies conjugated through streptavidin-biotin binding. The proposed research will provide a theoretical platform for interpreting experimental findings in similar complex scenarios and aid in the rational design of biomedical applications of ligand-receptor binding assays with crowded surfaces."

HH-FR3 abutting the Del/
Ins region 74 /H110061 [Figure 7D and Ins at position 75A of
two llama VHHs( V u et al. , 1997)] supports the gene
replacement mechanism (Reth et al. , 1986) involving
recombination-activating gene (RAG) proteins as observedin human and mouse (Klein ﬁeldet al. , 1986; Komori
et al. , 1993). The involvement of a RAG-like activity to
initiate the gene replacement predicts a DNA cleavagetwo bases upstream of the heptamer sequence (Ramsdenet al. , 1996). This is exactly the position where the
deletions are observed in these individual clones(Figure 7D). It is possible that improper joining (Meleket al. , 1998) causes these Ins/Dels, and proper joining
retains the sequence length but induces nucleotide replace-ments (Weinstein et al. , 1994). The latter possibly leads
to the increased variability observed in this region of theV
HH(Figure 5). The region around position 75 lies in a
solvent exposed loop immediately adjacent to the H2 loopin the folded Ig domain. In monomeric T-cell receptors,the corresponding region is also hypervariable and reportedto interact with ligand (Howell et al. , 1991). By analogy,
we suppose that this VHHregion can be involved in the

The research proposal is to evaluate the extent of the VHH antigen-binding repertoire by analyzing the germline VHH segments to gain insight into the ways by which the dromedary HCAbs acquire a complex repertoire of Ag-binding sites. This will involve studying the diversity of the VHH antigen-binding loops and investigating the potential VHH germline repertoire to understand the mechanisms of somatic mutation processes and the impact on the structure of the antigen-binding loops."

of “mountains” (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of “hills”
(genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed ~140 genes that, when altered by
intragenic mutations, can promote or “drive” tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight
of these “driver gene” mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective
growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three
core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding
of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however,
our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective
approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.
Ten years ago, the idea that all of the genes altered in cancer could be identified at base-pair
resolution would have seemed like science fiction. Today, such genome-wide analysis,
through sequencing of the exome (see Box 1, Glossary, for definitions of terms used in this
Review) or of the whole genome, is routine.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe prototypical exomic studies of cancer evaluated ~20 tumors at a cost of >$100,000 per
case (1–3). Today, the cost of this sequencing has been reduced 100-fold, and studies
reporting the sequencing of more than 100 tumors of a given type are the norm (table S1A).
Although vast amounts of data can now be readily obtained, deciphering this information in
meaningful terms is still challenging. Here, we review what has been learned about cancer
genomes from these sequencing studies—and, more importantly, what this information has
taught us about cancer biology and future cancer management strategies.
How Many Genes Are Subtly Mutated in a Typical Human Cancer?
In common solid tumors such as those derived from the colon, breast, brain, or pancreas, an
average of 33 to 66 genes display subtle somatic mutations that would be expected to alter
their protein products (Fig. 1A). About 95% of these mutations are single-base substitutions
(such as C>G), whereas the remainder are deletions or insertions of one or a few bases (such
as CTT>CT) (table S1B). Of the base substitutions, 90.7% result in missense changes, 7.6%
result in nonsense changes, and 1.7% result in alterations of splice sites or untranslated
regions immediately adjacent to the start and stop codons (table S1B).
Certain tumor types display many more or many fewer mutations than average (Fig. 1B).
Notable among these outliers are melanomas and lung tumors, which contain ~200
nonsynonymous mutations per tumor (table S1C). These larger numbers reflect the
involvement of potent mutagens (ultraviolet light and cigarette smoke, respectively) in the
pathogenesis of these tumor types. Accordingly, lung cancers from smokers have 10 times
as many somatic mutations as those from nonsmokers (4). Tumors with defects in DNA
repair form another group of outliers (5). For example, tumors with mismatch repair defects
can harbor thousands of mutations (Fig. 1B), even more than lung tumors or melanomas.
Recent studies have shown that high numbers of mutations are also found in tumors with
genetic alterations of the proofreading domain of DNA polymerases POLE or POLD1 (6, 7).
At the other end of the spectrum, pediatric tumors and leukemias harbor far fewer point
mutations: on average, 9.6 per tumor (table S1C). The basis for this observation is
considered below.
Mutation Timing
When do these mutations occur? Tumors evolve from benign to malignant lesions by
acquiring a series of mutations over time, a process that has been particularly well studied in
colorectal tumors (8, 9). The first, or “gatekeeping,” mutation provides a selective growth
advantage to a normal epithelial cell, allowing it to outgrow the cells that surround it and
become a microscopic clone (Fig. 2). Gatekeeping mutations in the colon most often occur
in the APC  gene (10). The small adenoma that results from this mutation grows slowly, but
a second mutation in another gene, such as KRAS , unleashes a second round of clonal
growth that allows an expansion of cell number (9). The cells with only the APC  mutation
may persist, but their cell numbers are small compared with the cells that have mutations in
both genes. This process of mutation followed by clonal expansion continues, with
mutations in genes such as PIK3CA , SMAD4 , and TP53 , eventually generating a malignant
tumor that can invade through the underlying basement membrane and metastasize to lymph
nodes and distant organs such as the liver (11). The mutations that confer a selective growth
advantage to the tumor cell are called “driver” mutations. It has been estimated (12) that
each driver mutation provides only a small selective growth advantage to the cell, on the
order of a 0.4% increase in the difference between cell birth and cell death. Over many
years, however, this slight increase, compounded once or twice per week, can result in a
large mass, containing billions of cells.Vogelstein et al. Page 5
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe number of mutations in certain tumors of self-renewing tissues is directly correlated
with age (13). When evaluated through linear regression, this correlation implies that more
than half of the somatic mutations identified in these tumors occur during the preneoplastic
phase; that is, during the growth of normal cells that continuously replenish gastrointestinal
and genito-urinary epithelium and other tissues. All of these pre-neoplastic mutations are
“passenger” mutations that have no effect on the neoplastic process. This result explains
why a colorectal tumor in a 90-year-old patient has nearly twice as many mutations as a
morphologically identical colorectal tumor in a 45-year-old patient. This finding also partly
explains why advanced brain tumors (glioblastomas) and pancreatic cancers (pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinomas) have fewer mutations than colorectal tumors; glial cells of the
brain and epithelial cells of the pancreatic ducts do not replicate, unlike the epithelial cells
lining the crypts of the colon. Therefore, the gatekeeping mutation in a pancreatic or brain
cancer is predicted to occur in a precursor cell that contains many fewer mutations than are
present in a colorectal precursor cell. This line of reasoning also helps to explain why
pediatric cancers have fewer mutations than adult tumors. Pediatric cancers often occur in
non–self-renewing tissues, and those that arise in renewing tissues (such as leukemias)
originate from precursor cells that have not renewed themselves as often as in adults. In
addition, pediatric tumors, as well as adult leukemias and lymphomas, may require fewer
rounds of clonal expansion than adult solid tumors (8, 14). Genome sequencing studies of
leukemia patients support the idea that mutations occur as random events in normal
precursor cells before these cells acquire an initiating mutation (15).
When during tumorigenesis do the remaining somatic mutations occur? Because mutations
in tumors occur at predictable and calculable rates (see below), the number of somatic
mutations in tumors provides a clock, much like the clock used in evolutionary biology to
determine species divergence time. The number of mutations has been measured in tumors
representing progressive stages of colorectal and pancreatic cancers (11, 16). Applying the
evolutionary clock model to these data leads to two unambiguous conclusions: First, it takes
decades to develop a full-blown, metastatic cancer. Second, virtually all of the mutations in
metastatic lesions were already present in a large number of cells in the primary tumors.
The timing of mutations is relevant to our understanding of metastasis, which is responsible
for the death of most patients with cancer. The primary tumor can be surgically removed,
but the residual metastatic lesions—often undetectable and widespread—remain and
eventually enlarge, compromising the function of the lungs, liver, or other organs. From a
genetics perspective, it would seem that there must be mutations that convert a primary
cancer to a metastatic one, just as there are mutations that convert a normal cell to a benign
tumor, or a benign tumor to a malignant one (Fig. 2). Despite intensive effort, however,
consistent genetic alterations that distinguish cancers that metastasize from cancers that have
not yet metastasized remain to be identified.
One potential explanation invokes mutations or epigenetic changes that are difficult to
identify with current technologies (see section on “dark matter” below). Another explanation
is that meta-static lesions have not yet been studied in sufficient detail to identify these
genetic alterations, particularly if the mutations are heterogeneous in nature. But another
possible explanation is that there are no metastasis genes. A malignant primary tumor can
take many years to metastasize, but this process is, in principle, explicable by stochastic
processes alone (17, 18). Advanced tumors release millions of cells into the circulation each
day, but these cells have short half-lives, and only a miniscule fraction establish metastatic
lesions (19). Conceivably, these circulating cells may, in a nondeterministic manner,
infrequently and randomly lodge in a capillary bed in an organ that provides a favorable
microenvironment for growth. The bigger the primary tumor mass, the more likely that this
process will occur. In this scenario, the continual evolution of the primary tumor wouldVogelstein et al. Page 6

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptreflect local selective advantages rather than future selective advantages. The idea that
growth at metastatic sites is not dependent on additional genetic alterations is also supported
by recent results showing that even normal cells, when placed in suitable environments such
as lymph nodes, can grow into organoids, complete with a functioning vasculature (20).
Other Types of Genetic Alterations in Tumors
Though the rate of point mutations in tumors is similar to that of normal cells, the rate of
chromosomal changes in cancer is elevated (21). Therefore, most solid tumors display
widespread changes in chromosome number (aneuploidy), as well as deletions, inversions,
translocations, and other genetic abnormalities. When a large part of a chromosome is
duplicated or deleted, it is difficult to identify the specific “target” gene(s) on the
chromosome whose gain or loss confers a growth advantage to the tumor cell. Target genes
are more easily identified in the case of chromosome translocations, homozygous deletions,
and gene amplifications. Translocations generally fuse two genes to create an oncogene
(such as BCR-ABL  in chronic myelogenous leukemia) but, in a small number of cases, can
inactivate a tumor suppressor gene by truncating it or separating it from its promoter.
Homozygous deletions often involve just one or a few genes, and the target is always a
tumor suppressor gene. Amplifications contain an oncogene whose protein product is
abnormally active simply because the tumor cell contains 10 to 100 copies of the gene per
cell, compared with the two copies present in normal cells.
Most solid tumors have dozens of translocations; however, as with point mutations, the
majority of translocations appear to be passengers rather than drivers. The breakpoints of the
translocations are often in “gene deserts” devoid of known genes, and many of the
translocations and homozygous deletions are adjacent to fragile sites that are prone to
breakage. Cancer cells can, perhaps, survive such chromosome breaks more easily than
normal cells because they contain mutations that incapacitate genes like TP53 , which would
normally respond to DNA damage by triggering cell death. Studies to date indicate that there
are roughly 10 times fewer genes affected by chromosomal changes than by point mutations.
Figure 3 shows the types and distribution of genetic alterations that affect protein-coding
genes in five representative tumor types. Protein-coding genes account for only ~1.5% of the
total genome, and the number of alterations in noncoding regions is proportionately higher
than the number affecting coding regions. The vast majority of the alterations in noncoding
regions are presumably passengers. These noncoding mutations, as well as the numerous
epigenetic changes found in cancers, will be discussed later.
Drivers Versus Passenger Mutations
Though it is easy to define a “driver gene mutation” in physiologic terms (as one conferring
a selective growth advantage), it is more difficult to identify which somatic mutations are
drivers and which are passengers. Moreover, it is important to point out that there is a
fundamental difference between a driver gene and a driver gene mutation. A driver gene is
one that contains driver gene mutations. But driver genes may also contain passenger gene
mutations. For example, APC  is a large driver gene, but only those mutations that truncate
the encoded protein within its N-terminal 1600 amino acids are driver gene mutations.
Missense mutations throughout the gene, as well as protein-truncating mutations in the C-
terminal 1200 amino acids, are passenger gene mutations.
Numerous statistical methods to identify driver genes have been described. Some are based
on the frequency of mutations in an individual gene compared with the mutation frequency
of other genes in the same or related tumors after correction for sequence context and gene
size (22, 23). Other methods are based on the predicted effects of mutation on the encoded
protein, as inferred from biophysical studies (24–26). All of these methods are useful forVogelstein et al. Page 7
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptprioritizing genes that are most likely to promote a selective growth advantage when
mutated. When the number of mutations in a gene is very high, as with TP53  or KRAS , any
reasonable statistic will indicate that the gene is extremely likely to be a driver gene. These
highly mutated genes have been termed “mountains” (1). Unfortunately, however, genes
with more than one, but still relatively few mutations (so called “hills”) numerically
dominate cancer genome landscapes (1). In these cases, methods based on mutation
frequency and context alone cannot reliably indicate which genes are drivers, because the
background rates of mutation vary so much among different patients and regions of the
genome. Recent studies of normal cells have indicated that the rate of mutation varies by
more than 100-fold within the genome (27). In tumor cells, this variation can be higher and
may affect whole regions of the genome in an apparently random fashion (28). Thus, at best,
methods based on mutation frequency can only prioritize genes for further analysis but
cannot unambiguously identify driver genes that are mutated at relatively low frequencies.
Further complicating matters, there are two distinct meanings of the term “driver gene” that
are used in the cancer literature. The driver-versus-passenger concept was originally used to
distinguish mutations that caused a selective growth advantage from those that did not (29).
According to this definition, a gene that does not harbor driver gene mutations cannot be a
driver gene. But many genes that contain few or no driver gene mutations have been labeled
driver genes in the literature. These include genes that are overexpressed, underexpressed, or
epigenetically altered in tumors, or those that enhance or inhibit some aspect of
tumorigenicity when their expression is experimentally manipulated. Though a subset of
these genes may indeed play an important role in the neoplastic process, it is confusing to
lump them all together as driver genes.
To reconcile the two connotations of driver genes, we suggest that genes suspected of
increasing the selective growth advantage of tumor cells be categorized as either “Mut-
driver genes” or “Epi-driver genes.” Mut-driver genes contain a sufficient number or type of
driver gene mutations to unambiguously distinguish them from other genes. Epi-driver
genes are expressed aberrantly in tumors but not frequently mutated; they are altered
through changes in DNA methylation or chromatin modification that persist as the tumor
cell divides.
A Ratiometric Method to Identify and Classify Mut-Driver Genes
If mutation frequency, corrected for mutation context, gene length, and other parameters,
cannot reliably identify modestly mutated driver genes, what can? In our experience, the
best way to identify Mut-driver genes is through their pattern of mutation rather than
through their mutation frequency. The patterns of mutations in well-studied oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes are highly characteristic and nonrandom. Oncogenes are recurrently
mutated at the same amino acid positions, whereas tumor suppressor genes are mutated
through protein-truncating alterations throughout their length (Fig. 4 and table S2A).
On the basis of these mutation patterns rather than frequencies, we can determine which of
the 18,306 mutated genes containing a total of 404,863 subtle mutations that have been
recorded in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database (30) are
Mut-driver genes and whether they are likely to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor
genes. To be classified as an oncogene, we simply require that >20% of the recorded
mutations in the gene are at recurrent positions and are missense (see legend to table S2A).
To be classified as a tumor suppressor gene, we analogously require that >20% of the
recorded mutations in the gene are inactivating. This “20/20 rule” is lenient in that all well-
documented cancer genes far surpass these criteria (table S2A).Vogelstein et al. Page 8
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe following examples illustrate the value of the 20/20 rule. When IDH1  mutations were
first identified in brain tumors, their role in tumorigenesis was unknown (2, 31). Initial
functional studies suggested that IDH1  was a tumor suppressor gene and that mutations
inactivated this gene (32). However, nearly all of the mutations in IDH1  were at the identical
amino acid, codon 132 (Fig. 4). As assessed by the 20/20 rule, this distribution
unambiguously indicated that IDH1  was an oncogene rather than a tumor suppressor gene,
and this conclusion was eventually supported by biochemical experiments (33, 34). Another
example is provided by mutations in NOTCH1 . In this case, some functional studies
suggested that NOTCH1  was an oncogene, whereas others suggested it was a tumor
suppressor gene (35, 36). The situation could be clarified through the application of the
20/20 rule to NOTCH1  mutations in cancers. In “liquid tumors” such as lymphomas and
leukemias, the mutations were often recurrent and did not truncate the predicted protein
(37). In squamous cell carcinomas, the mutations were not recurrent and were usually
inactivating (38–40). Thus, the genetic data clearly indicated that NOTCH1  functions
differently in different tumor types. The idea that the same gene can function in completely
opposite ways in different cell types is important for understanding cell signaling pathways.
How Many Mut-Driver Genes Exist?
Though all 20,000 protein-coding genes have been evaluated in the genome-wide
sequencing studies of 3284 tumors, with a total of 294,881 mutations reported, only 125
Mut-driver genes, as defined by the 20/20 rule, have been discovered to date (table S2A). Of
these, 71 are tumor suppressor genes and 54 are oncogenes. An important but relatively
small fraction (29%) of these genes was discovered to be mutated through unbiased genome-
wide sequencing; most of these genes had already been identified by previous, more directed
investigations.
How many more Mut-driver genes are yet to be discovered? We believe that a plateau is
being reached, because the same Mut-driver genes keep being “rediscovered” in different
tumor types. For example, MLL2  and MLL3  mutations were originally discovered in
medulloblastomas (41) and were subsequently discovered to be mutated in non-Hodgkin
lymphomas, prostate cancers, breast cancers, and other tumor types (42–45). Similarly,
ARID1A  mutations were first discovered to be mutated in clear-cell ovarian cancers (46, 47)
and were subsequently shown to be mutated in tumors of several other organs, including
those of the stomach and liver (48–50). In recent studies of several types of lung cancer (4,
51, 52), nearly all genes found to be mutated at significant frequencies had already been
identified in tumors of other organs. In other words, the number of frequently altered Mut-
driver genes (mountains) is nearing saturation. More mountains will undoubtedly be
discovered, but these will likely be in uncommon tumor types that have not yet been studied
in depth.
The newly discovered Mut-driver genes that have been detected through genome-wide
sequencing have often proved illuminating. For example, nearly half of these genes encode
proteins that directly regulate chromatin through modification of histones or DNA.
Examples include the histones HIST1H3B and H3F3A, as well as the proteins DNMT1 and
TET1, which covalently modify DNA, EZH2, SETD2, and KDM6A, which, in turn,
methylate or demethylate histones (53–57). These discoveries have profound implications
for understanding the mechanistic basis of the epigenetic changes that are rampant in tumors
(58). The discovery of genetic alterations in genes encoding mRNA splicing factors, such as
SF3B1  and U2AF1  (59–61), was similarly stunning, as mutations in these genes would be
expected to lead to a plethora of nonspecific cellular stresses rather than to promote specific
tumor types. Another example is provided by mutations in the cooperating proteins ATRX
and DAXX (62). Tumors with mutations in these genes all have a specific type of telomereVogelstein et al. Page 9
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptelongation process termed “ALT” (for “alternative lengthening of telomeres”) (63). Though
the ALT phenotype had been recognized for more than a decade, its genetic basis was
mysterious before the discovery of mutations of these genes and their perfect correlation
with the ALT phenotype (64). A final example is provided by IDH1  and IDH2 , whose
mutations have stimulated the burgeoning field of tumor metabolism (65) and have had
fascinating implications for epigenetics (66, 67).
The Mut-driver genes listed in table S2A are affected by subtle mutations: base
substitutions, intragenic insertions, or deletions. As noted above, Mut-driver genes can also
be altered by less subtle changes, such as translocations, amplifications, and large-scale
deletions. As with point mutations, it can be difficult to distinguish Mut-driver genes that are
altered by these types of changes from genes that contain only passenger mutations. Genes
that are not point-mutated, but are recurrently amplified (e.g., MYC  family genes) or
homozygously deleted (e.g., MAP2K4 ) and that meet other criteria (e.g., being the only gene
in the amplicon or homozygously deleted region) are listed in table S2B. This adds 13 Mut-
driver genes—10 oncogenes that are amplified and 3 tumor suppressor genes that are
homozygously deleted—to the 125 driver genes that are affected by subtle mutations, for a
total of 138 driver genes discovered to date (table S2).
Translocations provide similar challenges for driver classification. An important discovery
related to this point is chromothripsis (68), a rare cataclysmic event involving one or a small
number of chromosomes that results in a large number of chromosomal rearrangements.
This complicates any inferences about causality, in the same way that mismatch repair
deficiency compromises the interpretation of point mutations. However, for completeness,
all fusion genes that have been identified in at least three independent tumors are listed in
table S3. Virtually all of these genes were discovered through conventional approaches
before the advent of genome-wide DNA sequencing studies, with some notable exceptions
such as those described in (6) and (69). The great majority of these translocations are found
in liquid tumors (leukemias and lymphomas) (table S3C) or mesenchymal tumors (table
S3B) and were initially identified through karyotypic analyses. A relatively small number of
recurrent fusions, the most important of which include ERG  in prostate cancers (70) and
ALK  in lung cancers (71), have been described in more common tumors (table S3A).
Genes exist that predispose to cancer when inherited in mutant form in the germ line, but are
not somatically mutated in cancer to a substantial degree. These genes generally do not
confer an increase in selective growth advantage when they are abnormal, but they stimulate
tumorigenesis in indirect ways (such as by increasing genetic instability, as discussed later
in this Review). For completeness, these genes and the hereditary syndromes for which they
are responsible are listed in table S4.
Dark Matter
Classic epidemiologic studies have suggested that solid tumors ordinarily require five to
eight “hits,” now interpreted as alterations in driver genes, to develop (72). Is this number
compatible with the molecular genetic data? In pediatric tumors such as medulloblastomas,
the number of driver gene mutations is low (zero to two), as expected from the discussion
above (Fig. 5). In common adult tumors—such as pancreatic, colorectal, breast, and brain
cancers—the number of mutated driver genes is often three to six, but several tumors have
only one or two driver gene mutations (Fig. 5). How can this be explained, given the widely
accepted notion that tumor development and progression require multiple, sequential genetic
alterations acquired over decades?
First, technical issues explain some of the “missing mutations.” Genome-wide sequencing is
far from perfect, at least with the technologies available today. Some regions of the genomeVogelstein et al. Page 10
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptare not well represented because their sequences are difficult to amplify, capture, or
unambiguously map to the genome (73–76). Second, there is usually a wide distribution in
the number of times that a specific nucleotide in a given gene is observed in the sequence
data, so some regions will not be well represented by chance factors alone (77). Finally,
primary tumors contain not only neoplastic cells, but also stromal cells that dilute the signal
from the mutated base, further reducing the probability of finding a mutation (78).
What fraction of mutations are missed by these three technical issues? A recent study of
pancreatic cancers is informative in this regard. Biankin et al. used immunohistochemical
and genetic analyses to select a set of primary tumor samples enriched in neoplastic cells
(79). They used massively parallel sequencing to analyze the exomes of these samples, then
compared their mutational data with a set of pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenografts in
which mutations had previously been identified, using conventional Sanger sequencing, and
confirmed to be present in the primary tumors (3, 16). Only 159 (63%) of the expected 251
driver gene mutations were identified in the primary tumors studied by next-generation
sequencing alone, indicating a false-negative rate of 37%. Genome-wide studies in which
the proportion of neoplastic cells within tumors is not as carefully evaluated as in (79) will
have higher false-negative rates. Moreover, these technical problems are exacerbated in
whole-genome studies compared with exomic analyses, because the sequence coverage of
the former is often lower than that of the latter (generally 30-fold in whole-genome studies
versus more than 100-fold in exomic studies).
Conceptual issues also limit the number of detectable drivers. Virtually all studies, either at
the whole-genome or whole-exome level, have focused on the coding regions. The reason
for this is practical; it is difficult enough to identify driver gene mutations when they
qualitatively alter the sequence of the encoded protein. Trying to make sense of intergenic or
intronic mutations is much more difficult. Based on analogous studies of the identifiable
mutations in patients with monogenic diseases, more than 80% of mutations should be
detectable through analysis of the coding regions (80). However, this still leaves some
mutations as unidentifiable “dark matter,” even in the germline genomes of heritable cases,
which are usually easier to interpret than the somatic mutations in cancers. The first
examples of light coming to such dark matter have recently been published: Recurrent
mutations in the promoter of the TERT  gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase,
have been identified and shown to activate its transcription (81, 82).
Mut-driver genes other than those listed in table S2 will undoubtedly be discovered as
genome-wide sequencing continues. However, based on the trends noted above, most of the
Mut-driver genes will likely be mountains in rare tumor types or small hills in common
tumor types; thus, these genes are unlikely to account for the bulk of the presumptive dark
matter. Other types of dark matter can be envisioned, however. Copy-number alterations are
ubiquitous in cancers, at either the whole-chromosome or subchromosomal levels. These
alterations could subtly change the expression of their driver genes. Recent studies have
suggested that the loss of one copy of chromosomes containing several tumor suppressor
genes, each plausibly connected to neoplasia but not altered by mutation, may confer a
selective growth advantage (83, 84).
The most obvious source of dark matter is in Epi-driver genes. Human tumors contain large
numbers of epigenetic changes affecting DNA or chromatin proteins. For example, a recent
study of colorectal cancers showed that more than 10% of the protein-coding genes were
differentially methylated when compared with normal colorectal epithelial cells (85). Some
of these changes (i.e., those in Epi-driver genes) are likely to provide a selective growth
advantage (86, 87). For example, epigenetic silencing of CDK2NA  and MLH1  is much
more common than mutational inactivation of either of these two well-recognized driverVogelstein et al. Page 11
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptgenes (85) However, there is a critical difference between a genetic and an epigenetic
change in a gene. Unlike the sequence of a gene in a given individual, methylation is plastic,
varying with cell type, developmental stage, and patient age (21). The methylation state of
the normal precursor cells that initiate tumorigenesis is unknown; these cells, such as normal
stem cells, may represent only a tiny fraction of the cells in a normal organ. This plasticity
also means that methylation can change under microenvironmental cues, such as those
associated with low nutrient concentrations or abnormal cell contacts. It is therefore difficult
to know whether specific epigenetic changes observed in cancer cells reflect, rather than
contribute to, the neoplastic state. Criteria for distinguishing epigenetic changes that exert a
selective growth advantage from those that do not (passenger epigenetic changes) have not
yet been formulated. Given that Epi-driver genes are likely to compose a major component
of the dark matter, further research on this topic is essential (58).
Genetic Heterogeneity
The mutations depicted in Fig. 1 are clonal; that is, they are present in the majority of the
neoplastic cells in the tumors. But additional, subclonal (i.e., heterogeneous within the
tumor) mutations are important for understanding tumor evolution. Four types of genetic
heterogeneity are relevant to tumorigenesis (Fig. 6):
1.Intratumoral: heterogeneity among the cells of one tumor. This type of
heterogeneity has been recognized for decades. For example, it is rare to see a
cytogenetic study of a solid tumor in which all of the tumor cells display the same
karyotype (88). The same phenomenon has been noted for individual genes [e.g.,
(89)] and more recently has been observed throughout the genome (16, 90–96).
This kind of heterogeneity must exist: Every time a normal (or tumor) cell divides,
it acquires a few mutations, and the number of mutations that distinguish any two
cells simply marks the time from their last common ancestor (their founder cell).
Cells at the opposite ends of large tumors will be spatially distinct and, in general,
will display more differences than neighboring cells (16). This phenomenon is
analogous to speciation, wherein organisms on different islands are more likely to
diverge from one another than are organisms on the same island.
In studies that have evaluated intratumoral heterogeneity by genome-wide
sequencing, the majority of somatic mutations are present in all tumor cells. These
mutations form the trunk of the somatic evolutionary tree. What is the importance
of the mutations in the branches (i.e., those that are not shared by all tumor cells)?
From a medical perspective, these mutations are often meaningless because the
primary tumors are surgically removed. How much heterogeneity existed in the
various branches before surgery is not important. However, this heterogeneity
provides the seeds for intermetastastic heterogeneity, which is of great clinical
importance.
2.Intermetastatic: heterogeneity among different metastatic lesions of the same
patient. The vast majority of cancer patients die because their tumors were not
removed before metastasis to surgically inaccessible sites, such as the liver, brain,
lung, or bone. Patients who relapse with a single metastatic lesion can often still be
cured by surgery or radiotherapy, but single metastases are the exception rather
than the rule. A typical patient on a clinical trial has a dozen or more metastatic
lesions large enough to be visualized by imaging, and many more that are smaller.
If each of the metastatic lesions in a single patient was founded by a cell with a
very different genetic constitution, then chemotherapeutic cures would be nearly
impossible to achieve: Eradicating a subset of the metastatic lesions in a patient
will not be adequate for long-term survival.Vogelstein et al. Page 12
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptHow much heterogeneity is there among different metastatic lesions? In short, a lot.
It is not uncommon for one metastatic lesion to have 20 clonal genetic alterations
not shared by other metastases in the same patient (16, 97). Because they are
clonal, these mutations occurred in the founder cell of the metastasis; that is, the
cell that escaped from the primary tumor and multiplied to form the metastasis. The
founder cell for each metastasis is present in different, geographically distinct areas
of the primary tumors, as expected (16).
This potentially disastrous situation is tempered by the fact that the heterogeneity
appears largely confined to passenger gene mutations. In most of the studies
documenting heterogeneity in malignancies, the Mut-driver genes are present in the
trunks of the trees, though exceptions have been noted (95). These findings are
consistent with the idea, discussed above, that the genetic alterations required for
metastasis were present (i.e., selected for) before metastasis actually occurred. The
data are also consistent with the observation that in patients responsive to targeted
agents, the response is often seen in all metastatic lesions rather than just a small
subset (98).
3.Intrametastatic: heterogeneity among the cells of an individual metastasis. Each
metastasis is established by a single cell (or small group of cells) with a set of
founder mutations. As it grows, the metastasis acquires new mutations with each
cell division. Though the founder mutations may make the lesion susceptible to
antitumor agents, the new mutations provide the seeds for drug resistance. Unlike
primary tumors, the metastatic lesions generally cannot be removed by surgery and
must be treated with systemic therapies. Patients with complete responses to
targeted therapies invariably relapse. Most of the initial lesions generally recur, and
the time frame at which they recur is notably similar. This time course can be
explained by the presence of resistance mutations that existed within each
metastasis before the onset of the targeted therapy (99–102). Calculations show that
any metastatic lesion of a size visible on medical imaging has thousands of cells
(among the billions present) that are already resistant to virtually any drug that can
be imagined (99, 101, 102). Thus, recurrence is simply a matter of time, entirely
predictable on the basis of known mutation frequencies and tumor cell growth
rates. This “fait accompli” can be circumvented, in principle, by treatment with
multiple agents, as it is unlikely that a single tumor cell will be resistant to multiple
drugs that act on different targets.
4.Interpatient: heterogeneity among the tumors of different patients. This type of
heterogeneity has been observed by every oncologist; no two cancer patients have
identical clinical courses, with or without therapy. Some of these differences could
be related to host factors, such as germline variants that determine drug half-life or
vascular permeability to drugs or cells, and some could be related to nongenetic
factors (103). However, much of this interpatient heterogeneity is probably related
to somatic mutations within tumors. Though several dozen somatic mutations may
be present in the breast cancers from two patients, only a small number are in the
same genes, and in the vast majority of cases, these are the Mut-driver genes (1,
104, 105). Even in these driver genes, the actual mutations are often different.
Mutations altering different domains of a protein would certainly not be expected
to have identical effects on cellular properties, as experimentally confirmed (106).
Though it may seem that different mutations in adjacent codons would have
identical effects, detailed studies of large numbers of patients have shown that this
need not be the case. For example, a Gly12→Asp12 (G12D) mutation of KRAS
does not have the same clinical implications as a G13D mutation of the same gene
(107). Interpatient heterogeneity has always been one of the major obstacles toVogelstein et al. Page 13
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 August 22.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptdesigning uniformly effective treatments for cancer. Efforts to individualize
treatments based on knowledge of the genomes of cancer patients are largely based
on an appreciation of this heterogeneity.
Signaling Pathways in Tumors
The immense complexity of cancer genomes that could be inferred from the data described
above is somewhat misleading. After all, even advanced tumors are not completely out of
control, as evidenced by the dramatic responses to agents that target mutant BRAF  in
melanomas (108) or mutant ALK  in lung cancers (109). Albeit transient, these responses
mean that interference with even a single mutant gene product is sufficient to stop cancer in
its tracks, at least transiently. How can the genomic complexity of cancer be reconciled with
these clinical observations?
Two concepts bear on this point. The first, mentioned above, is that >99.9% of the
alterations in tumors (including point mutations, copy-number alterations, translocations,
and epigenetic changes distributed throughout the genome, not just in the coding regions)
are immaterial to neoplasia. They are simply passenger changes that mark the time that has
elapsed between successive clonal expansions. Normal cells also undergo genetic alterations
as they divide, both at the nucleotide and chromosomal levels. However, normal cells are
programmed to undergo cell death in response to such alterations, perhaps as a protective
mechanism against cancer. In contrast, cancer cells have evolved to tolerate genome
complexity by acquiring mutations in genes such as TP53  (110). Thus, genomic complexity
is, in part, the result of cancer, rather than the cause.
To appreciate the second concept, one must take the 30,000-foot view. A jungle might look
chaotic at ground level, but the aerial view shows a clear order, with all the animals
gathering at the streams at certain points in the day, and all the streams converging at a river.
There is order in cancer, too. Mutations in all of the 138 driver genes listed in table S2 do
one thing: cause a selective growth advantage, either directly or indirectly. Moreover, there
appears to be only a limited number of cellular signaling pathways through which a growth
advantage can be incurred (Fig. 7 and table S5).
All of the known driver genes can be classified into one or more of 12 pathways (Fig. 7).
The discovery of the molecular components of these pathways is one of the greatest
achievements of biomedical research, a tribute to investigators working in fields that
encompass biochemistry, cell biology, and development, as well as cancer. These pathways
can themselves be further organized into three core cellular processes:
1.Cell fate: Numerous studies have demonstrated the opposing relationship between
cell division and differentiation, the arbiters of cell fate. Dividing cells that are
responsible for populating normal tissues (stem cells) do not differentiate, and vice
versa. Regenerative medicine is based on this distinction, predicated on ways to ",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to better understand the role of genetic heterogeneity in tumor evolution and its implications for cancer treatment strategies.,"Research hypothesis: The genetic heterogeneity observed in tumor evolution is indicative of distinct clonal and subclonal mutations that contribute to the development and progression of cancer. These mutations are likely to affect specific signaling pathways and cellular processes, leading to the selective growth advantage of neoplastic cells.

Research proposal: This study aims to investigate the impact of genetic heterogeneity on tumor evolution by analyzing clonal and subclonal mutations in various types of human cancer. The research will focus on identifying the specific driver genes and pathways that are affected by these mutations and their implications for cancer progression and treatment strategies. The findings will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor evolution and may guide the development of targeted therapies for cancer patients."

Abstract
Antibodies have the ability to bind various types of antigens and to recognize different antibody-binding sites (epitopes) of the same antigen with different binding affinities. Due to the conserved structural framework of antibodies, their specificity to antigens is mainly determined by their antigen-binding site (paratope). Therefore, characterization of epitopes in combination with describing the involved conformational changes of the paratope upon binding is crucial in understanding and predicting antibody-antigen binding. Using molecular dynamics simulations complemented with strong experimental structural information, we investigated the underlying binding mechanism and the resulting local and global surface plasticity in the binding interfaces of distinct antibody-antigen complexes. In all studied allergen-antibody complexes, we clearly observe that experimentally suggested epitopes reveal less plasticity, while non-epitope regions show high surface plasticity. Surprisingly, the paratope shows higher conformational diversity reflected in substantially higher surface plasticity, compared to the epitope. This work allows a visualization and characterization of antibody-antigen interfaces and might have strong implications for antibody-antigen docking and in the area of epitope prediction.
Issue Section:
Original Article
Introduction
In the last decades, antibodies constitute one of the fastest growing areas in the field of biologic drugs and importance of antibodies as biotherapeutics increased substantially (Chames et al., 2009; Kaplon and Reichert, 2019). The antibody diversity and variability are concentrated on six hypervariable loops, also known as the complementarity-determining region (CDR), located at the antibody variable domain (Chothia et al., 1989; Al-Lazikani et al., 1997). Three CDR loops are situated on the heavy and the light chain, respectively. These six hypervariable loops form together with the relative interdomain orientation VH-VL the paratope, which is the antigen-binding site (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Dunbar et al., 2013). Characterization of the antigen-binding process is a vital step in antibody engineering. Besides characterization of the paratope also the detailed understanding of the antibody-binding site (epitope) recognized by the antibody is highly valuable for antibody and vaccine design (Pomés et al., 2015b). Allergens have emerged as important class of antigens, because they bind to the antibody isotype Immunoglobulin E (IgE). The symptoms associated with allergy are caused by cross-linking of IgE on effector cells (Mueller, 2017). The number of available different allergen structures has increased significantly, and this experimental structural information has provided more insights in understanding allergic disease (Pomés et al., 2015a). The availability of structural information on allergens allows insights in biophysical properties and biological functions in combination with various hypotheses about the mechanism behind allergen sensitization either through proteolytic activity or immune mimicry (Karp, 2010; Mueller et al., 2019). Additionally, these structures improved the understanding of clinical cross-reactivity and supported the development of hypoallergenic derivates for allergy vaccines (Tscheppe and Breiteneder, 2017). Various structural studies focused on understanding antibody specificity and cross-reactivity and observed antigen-antibody interactions at atomistic level (Dall’Antonia et al., 2014; Mueller, 2017; Tscheppe and Breiteneder, 2017). Recent antibody-allergen crystal structures provided detailed epitope information, insights in antibody recognition of complex molecular surfaces and an idea of the possible number of epitopes recognizable by the same antibody (Droupadi et al., 1994; Mirza et al., 2000; Chruszcz et al., 2012; Dall’Antonia et al., 2014; Pomés et al., 2015b; Kuroda and Gray, 2016; Mitropoulou et al., 2018).The ability of the same antibody to bind different epitopes or antigens follows the concept of conformational variability and this could increase the functional diversity of a limited repertoire of sequences and thereby facilitate the evolution of new antibodies (Pauling, 1940; Foote and Milstein, 1994; James and Tawfik, 2003). Thus, we analyzed the conformational diversity of antibody-antigen complexes by calculating the conformational surface plasticity and characterized both epitopes and paratopes. Additionally, we investigated the involved binding mechanism captured with our simulations. Methods
Various studies showed the characterization of the conformational diversity in antibody-antigen binding is crucial to understand the binding mechanisms and identify potentially relevant binding competent conformations in solution. Experimental structure information was available for all considered antibody fragments (Fabs), allergens and complexes. The starting structures for simulations were prepared in MOE (Molecular Operating Environment, Chemical Computing Group, version 2018.01) using the Protonate3D tool (Labute, 2009). To neutralize the charges we used the uniform background charge (Roe and Cheatham, 2013; Hub et al., 2014; Case et al. 2016). Using the tleap tool of the AmberTools18 (Case et al. 2018) package, the crystal structures were soaked with cubic water boxes of TIP3P water molecules with a minimum wall distance of 10 Å to the protein (Jorgensen et al., 1983). For all crystal structures parameters of the AMBER force field 14SB were used (Maier et al., 2015). The antibody fragments and allergens were carefully equilibrated using a multistep equilibration protocol (Wallnoefer et al., 2011). Table I shows a summary of all simulated crystal and solution structures, used as starting structures for Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (gaMD) simulations. If an unbound allergen structure was available, we used this as starting structure for gaMD simulations.

Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations
Taking the dynamics of biomolecules into account is crucial to understand their biological activity and function. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture flexibility on the nano-to-microsecond timescale, while various other relevant processes occur in much higher timescales. In this study we chose gaMD simulations, because it allows the simulations to overcome potential energy barriers without prior knowledge of the free energy surface (FES) (Miao and McCammon, 2017). The sampling is improved by the addition of a bias potential to the original FES potential, for potential energies below a threshold energy. The FES is smoothened by raising the potentials near the minima and leave the potentials close to the barriers unaffected (Bhattarai and Miao, 2018). In gaMD the bias potential is set as a harmonic potential, following Gaussian distribution. Starting from the previously solvated and equilibrated proteins, gaMD simulations were initiated with a 2 ns MD run, in which the simulation parameters for the actual gaMD simulations were obtained. We used the recommended simulation parameters and simulated the antibody-allergen complexes using dual boost on both dihedrals and the total potential. The gaMD simulations were performed in an NpT ensemble using the GPU implementation of the pmemd module (Salomon-Ferrer et al., 2013) to be as close to the experimental conditions as possible and to obtain the correct density distributions of both protein and water (Case et al. 2018). Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were restrained by applying the SHAKE algorithm (Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992), allowing a time step of 2.0 fs. Atmospheric pressure of the system was preserved by weak coupling to an external bath using the Monte Carlo barostat (Duane et al., 1987). The Langevin thermostat was used to maintain the temperature during simulations at 300 K (Adelman and Doll, 1976). All simulations were analyzed using cpptraj (Roe and Cheatham, 2013) in AmberTools18 (Case et al. 2018) the reweighting protocol provided by Miao et al., 2014, and in-house python (Millman and Aivazis 2011) scripts. We performed principle component analyses based on Cartesian coordinates of the Cα atoms ( Figures S3−S7) by using in-house python scripts and applied the PyEMMA library to visualize the covered conformational space (Scherer et al., 2015). The free energy profile was reconstructed from the gaMD simulations via Boltzmann reweighting using a Maclaurin series expansion as the approximation for the exponential term (Miao et al., 2014).

The orientation of the allergen is always the same. The substantially higher plasticity of Phl p 7 without the calcium ions present emphasizes the stabilizing role of the ions on the allergen binding site. The Phl p 7 allergen simulated in complex with the antibody reveals the lowest overall surface plasticity. Bottom: Gradient color-coded localized surface plasticity, highlighting differences in plasticity within one protein and between the studied variants. Characterization of surface plasticity
Conformational plasticity of proteins has been shown to play key role in molecular mechanisms such as catalytic activity, biomolecular recognition and allosteric regulation. Smooth antibody surfaces were generated by placing a Gaussian function on the center of each atom at every simulation frame. The average and standard deviation of the resulting grids were generated. An isovalue of the averaged grid can be used to visualize a typical protein surface. In contrast, the standard deviation shows regions that are sometimes occupied by the protein and solvent accessible. To emphasize large regions of high flexibility, a further Gaussian smoothing was applied on the standard deviation grid. Results
As first antibody-allergen complex systems we chose the human antibody binding to the grass pollen polcalcin Phl p 7. The abbreviation Phl p derives from the latin term Phleum pratense and is the taxonomic name of the timothy grass plant, from which the allergens originate (Marsh et al., 1986; Pomés et al., 2018). Polcalcins are important respiratory panallergens, whose antibody IgE binding capacity depends on the presence of calcium (Raith et al., 2019). As starting structures we chose the complex of an antibody-binding fragment (Fab) binding simultaneously two Phl p 7 molecules (PDB accession code: 5OTJ). Additionally, the two antigens bridge two identical antibodies and challenge the theory that one antibody is only able to recognize one antigen epitope (Mitropoulou et al., 2018). Due to the vital role of calcium to the function of Phl p 7, we included a variant with four mutations of the calcium-coordinating amino acids in the highly conserved calcium-binding domains. We introduced these four mutations by replacing the three aspartates and one asparagine with alanine. This Phl p 7 variant still represents a folded protein, however, loses the ability to bind calcium (Raith et al., 2019). Following the procedure described in the methods section, we simulated the wildtype Phl p 7 crystal structure with and without the two calcium ions present, the antibody complexed with Phl p 7 and in addition we also investigated the conformational diversity of the antibody without the presence of the allergen.Figure 1 shows the resulting surface plasticity of each 1 μs gaMD simulation of the wildtype Phl p 7 with and without calcium ions, with and without antibody present and the results clearly reveal substantial differences in surface plasticity. Especially without the presence of the calcium ions the epitope shows high surface plasticity, while with the calcium ions present the Phl p 7 conformational epitope free in solution displays significantly lower surface plasticity, similar to the resulting plasticity of Phl p 7 in complex with the antibody. The localized plasticity for all three Phl p 7 simulations, illustrated in Fig. 1, clearly shows a significant increase in flexibility, when simulated without ions. Figure 2 visualizes the results of the IgE Fab with and without the presence of Phl p 7 and we clearly see that the plasticity is reduced upon binding to the allergen, especially in the CDR-H3 loop, which is strongly involved in binding to the Phl p 7 allergen.
Fig. 2Open in new tabDownload slideIgE Fab binding to Phl p 7 simulated free in solution and in complex with Phl p 7 reveals a substantial decrease in surface plasticity in the CDR-H3 loop upon binding to the allergen. The orientation of the antibody is the same as shown for the complex with Phl p 7 on the right. Figures S1 and S2 illustrate the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values projected onto the structures of all studied Phl p 7 variants and we observe similar flexibility hotspots.Additionally, we were interested in investigating if during our simulations the allergen free in solution samples the binding competent shape and the results are shown in SI Fig. 3. The results in SI Fig. 3 clearly confirm that within the free ensemble in solution the binding competent conformation is frequently sampled. Comparison of the free ensembles in solution with the complex simulations show that the systems clearly follow the paradigm of conformational selection, because we observe a strong population shift toward the binding competent state. Figure 3 illustrates the results of the Phl p 7 variant, which loses the ability to bind calcium ions. As a consequence, not only the binding capacity to the antibody changes but also the thermal stability decreases substantially from 89 to 79°C. As a consequence of these mutations, we observe a significant increase in surface plasticity for the Phl p 7 variant (Raith et al., 2019).
Fig. 3Open in new tabDownload slideSurface plasticity of the Phl p 7 variant with the four mutated calcium ion stabilizing residues. Compared to the wildtype, the surface plasticity of the Phl p 7 variant reveals simulated free in solution, without ions and bound to the antibody substantially higher surface plasticity. This is in line with the lower thermostability and the decreased capacity to bind to the IgE Fab. The orientations of the Phl p 7 molecules are the same in all pictures and are shown in complex with the IgE Fab on the right.As second allergen-antibody complex we studied the complex between the major respiratory grass pollen allergen Phl p 2 and the specific human derived IgE Fab (Padavattan et al., 2009). The IgE-dominant epitope is formed by 21 residues located mainly within β strands. Nine of these 21 residues reveal van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions with the six CDR loops of the Fab (PDB accession code: 2VXQ). The conformational epitope was reported to be recognized with high affinity by the IgE Fab and thereby provide a structural basis for effector cell activation by allergen-antibody (IgE) immune complexes (Padavattan et al., 2009). The results of the obtained surface plasticity of the Phl p 2 molecule and the specific IgE Fab free in solution are shown in Fig. 4.
Fig. 4Open in new tabDownload slideTop: Surface plasticity of the Phl p 2 allergen and the specific IgE Fab both simulated free in solution. To better visualize the epitope, we included a 90° turn of the antibody and the Phl p 2 allergen on the right. In red the CDR-H3 loop is shown to easily identify the orientation. We clearly see that again the epitope of the Phl p 2 is more rigid compared to the paratope and the rest of the allergen, when simulated free in solution.We clearly observe in line with the results of the Phl p 7 molecule that the conformational epitope free in solution reveals less plasticity compared to other parts of the allergen, while the antibody illustrates the highest plasticity in the paratope. Analyses of the complex simulations show that the plasticity of the conformational epitope of Phl p 2 and the paratope are significantly reduced upon binding.The third investigated allergen-antibody complex describes the binding of the house-dust mite allergens to a specific IgE antibody 4C1. House dust mites produce potent allergens, e.g. Der p 1 and Der f 1, which cause sensitization and asthma. These two group 1 allergens are cysteine proteases and their proteolytic activity influences allergenicity. The sequence identity of the two group 1 allergens Der p1 and Der f 1 is more than 80% and therefore the reported cross-reactivity is not surprising. The presented antibody 4C1 Fab binds both allergens strongly. This is very unusual, because even though Der p 1 and Der f 1 show such a high sequence identity, the antibodies raised against these variants usually are species-specific and bind either Der p 1 or Der f 1 (Chruszcz et al., 2012). We simulated both available antibody-allergen complexes (PDB accession code 5VPG and 5VPL) and the free allergens in solution (PDB accession code 3F5V and 5PLG) to investigate differences in their conformational epitopes reflected in their revealed surface plasticity.Figure 5 visualizes the differences of the Der p 1 and Der f 1 allergens simulated free in solution and substantial differences in plasticity could be observed between the two allergens. For Der p 1 experimentally three epitopes were identified, while for Der f 1 only two epitopes were determined. Our results in Fig. 5 show that the captured surface plasticity of Der f 1 was substantially higher, compared to Der p 1, in particular in the area of the third identified epitope of Der p 1. The last investigated antibody-antigen complex is the D44.1 antibody complexed with the model antigen hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) and the resulting plasticity upon affinity maturation (Fig. 6).

We clearly see that the epitopes are the most rigid regions on the allergen. We identified all experimentally available epitopes and they are in line with the areas revealing the lowest surface plasticity free in solution.
Fig. 6Open in new tabDownload slideTop: Comparison of changes in the surface plasticity upon affinity maturation of the D44.1 antibody complexed with HEL (PDB accession code 1MLC (left), 1P2C (right)). While the plasticity of the HEL remains the same, especially the antibody paratope reveals a substantially decreased surface plasticity. Again, the epitope is the most rigid part of the allergen, while the paratope rigidifies upon affinity maturation. Bottom: Gradient color-coded localized surface plasticity, highlighting differences in plasticity before and after affinity maturation.Upon affinity maturation the paratope surface plasticity rigidifies significantly, which leads to a substantial increase of the complex stability. Again, in line with the previous observations the conformational epitope of the antigen reveals lower surface plasticity independent of performing the simulations free in solution or complexed with the D44.1 antibody. Discussion
This present study investigates the conformational diversity of allergen-antibody complexes and allows to determine the involved binding mechanism and characterizes the surface plasticity of allergen epitopes and antibody paratopes in solution. Various studies already investigated epitopes in terms of their physico-chemical, structural and dynamic properties, i.e. amino-acid preference, secondary structure composition and evolutionary conservation to determine which of these characterizations distinguish epitopes from the surrounding antigen surface (Rubinstein et al., 2008). Specifically, epitopes have been shown to be enriched with tyrosine and tryptophan residues and reveal preferences for charged and polar amino acids, which could enhance the number of possible interactions and thus contribute to more stabilized antibody-antigen complexes (Padlan, 1994; Jackson, 1999; Rubinstein et al., 2008). Additionally, also the antigenic shape, which is recognized the antibody, has been discussed to play a crucial role in biomolecular recognition, in particular flat surfaces on compact antigens have been identified as complementary to high-affinity antibody-binding sites (Wilson et al., 1991; Padlan, 1994; Wilson and Stanfield, 1994; Rubinstein et al., 2008). The epitope flexibility has been studied for various antibody-antigen complexes, also in combination with NMR experiments, showing that in numerous cases the antibody recognizes conformational epitopes in regions of relatively rigid structure on the antigen (Olejniczak et al., 2010). In agreement with these studies we observe in all four investigated allergen-antibody complexes that the epitope reveals less flexibility and plasticity, especially when comparing it to the antibody paratope. Previous studies showed the importance of taking the conformational diversity into account when characterizing antibody paratopes and the involved conformational changes upon antigen binding (Fernández-Quintero et al. 2019a, b, c). Conformational diversity of proteins, and the pre-existence of a conformational ensemble out of which the functional conformations are selected, has been focus of various studies (Foote and Milstein, 1994; James and Tawfik, 2003). The binding paradigm of conformational selection follows this idea of an ensemble of pre-existing conformational states with varying probabilities out of which the binding competent state is selected (Ma et al., 1999; Tsai et al., 1999; Csermely et al., 2010; (Fernández-Quintero et al. 2019a, b).The conformational selection mechanism has been discussed to be an extension of the induced fit mechanism proposed by Koshland, by considering the inherent flexibility of the proteins before binding (Koshland 1995; Ma et al., 1999; Csermely et al., 2010; Fernández-Quintero et al., 2020). Thus, both mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and in reality, the actual binding mechanism consists of various selection and adjustment processes, following the hypothesis of a pre-existing ensemble of weakly populated conformations, each of which is able to recognize different binding partners. Especially upon antibody maturation strong population shifts toward a smaller number of paratope states have been observed, thereby reducing the amount of possible binding partners (Ma et al., 1999; Tsai et al., 1999; Fernández-Quintero et al., 2019b). The investigated affinity maturation series of the D44.1 antibody binding to the model allergen HEL (Fig. 6) represents an example where only the antibody is mutated to enhance its specificity (Braden et al., 1994). We observe that both the global and local surface plasticity of naïve D44.1 antibody Fab are substantially higher compared to the decreased plasticity of the matured F10.6.6 antibody Fab, which is in line with the experimentally determined enhanced allergen-complex stability. As already described before, the allergen is the same in the wildtype and affinity-matured complex and in both cases the epitopes of the HEL reveal less plasticity and flexibility than the rest of the antigen. Astonishingly, we observe that also the other two potential lysozyme epitopes determined in crystal structures represent areas on the antigen with lower surface plasticity free in solution and in complex with the D44.1 antibody.
Figure S7 summarizes all potential lysozyme epitopes and visualizes the decrease in surface plasticity.
Figure S8 shows the free energy landscape of the lysozyme simulated free in solution and bound to the antibody. Apart from a strong population shift upon binding, we observe an additional miminum when simulating lysozyme free in solution. The first principle component in this case is dominated by a loop rearrangement (residues 80 to 89), which is more restricted upon antibody binding.Figures 1 and 3 show the results of the Phl p 7 simulations and the influence of the presence and absence of the calcium ions and four point mutations on the overall and in particularly, the epitope plasticity. We clearly see in agreement with experimental results that the two coordinated calcium ions between one asparagine and three aspartate residues are vital in stabilizing the conformational epitope of Phl p 7. This is reflected in a low surface plasticity of the Phl p 7 conformational epitope. Without the presence of the calcium ions the Phl p 7 allergen reveals a substantially higher surface plasticity, in line with the observations that without the binding of the calcium ions the ability to bind the antibody is abolished (Raith et al., 2019).
Figures S1 and S2 display a similar trend, when calculating RMSF values. However, high RMSF-values can also occur due to side-chain rotations, which do not necessarily translate into changes in the shape of the protein surface. As shape-complementary is an essential aspect of biomolecular recognition, we find that characterizing the protein plasticity allows a better shape-based interpretation of both, antibody and antigen binding sites, compared to other flexibility measures such as RMSF. The simulations of Phl p 7 in complex with the antibody present show a very similar result, because the plasticity of Phl p 7 epitope still exhibits less local and global surface plasticity. The FESs of the Phl p 7 allergen simulated bound to the antibody and free in solution ( Figure S3) show that even without the presence of the antibody, the binding competent state is present and frequently sampled. A clear difference between Phl p 7 simulated free in solution compared to the bound simulation is the restricted conformational diversity along the first principle component. The first principle component describes conformational rearrangements of the loop, which also reveals the highest plasticity and flexibility (residues 32 to 37), while the second principle component represents forward and backward movements of upper part of the last helix (residues 62 to 67). Thus, antigen binding strongly influences and restricts the conformational diversity of the loop, which mainly contributes to the first principle component.When mutating the key residues involved in stabilizing the calcium ions to alanine, we observe a similar plasticity compared to the Phl p 7 simulations without calcium ions bound. The mutants lead to a destabilization of the calcium ions and therefore also the binding capacity to the IgE Fab is abolished (Raith et al., 2019) and this loss of binding capacity to the ions and to the antibody is reflected in our results in a substantially higher plasticity, compared to the wildtype (Figs 1 and 3). Additionally, the calculated surface plasticity is in agreement with experimentally determined thermostability measurements (wildtype 89°C, mutant 79°C), because we surmise that lower melting temperature is reflected in higher surface plasticity and flexibility ( Figures S1 and S2). Focusing on the antibody, we clearly observe that the paratope reveals a significantly higher surface plasticity simulated free in solution, while the surface plasticity decreases substantially upon binding (Fig. 2). Figure 4 illustrates in line with the results of Phl p 7 that the surface plasticity of the epitope of Phl p 2 free in solution is lower compared to the rest of the allergen, while the antibody reveals a high surface plasticity of the paratope before binding to Phl p 2. Thus, also this example follows the concept of conformational selection by taking the pre-existing ensemble of conformations into consideration, which are accessible before binding. The captured plasticity of the Phl p 2 epitope and antibody paratope upon binding is substantially decreased, which might be correlated with the experimentally reported high complex stability (Padavattan et al., 2009).
Figure S4 shows a principle component analysis of Phl p 2 simulated in complex and free in solution. We again observe a strong population shift upon binding to the antibody. Also, in this example the motions of Phl p 2 dominating the first principle component are restricted upon binding. In strong agreement with the previously discussed antibody-allergen complexes the house dust mite allergens Der p 1 and Der f 1 binding to the 4C1 antibody (Fig. 5) exhibit a substantially lower surface plasticity in all three suggested epitopes for Der p 1 and two determined epitopes for Der f 1. The FESs of both Der p 1 and Der f 1 ( Figures S5 and S6) reveal a restriction in the first principle component upon binding. In both cases the second principle component describes conformational rearrangements of the loop located at the beginning of the protein (residue 30 to 25), while the principle component is dominated, especially when simulating free in solution, by the loop, which also reveals the highest plasticity (residues 93 to 106).By using enhanced sampling techniques, we observe in all analyzed antibody-allergen complexes that the allergen epitopes exhibit lower surface plasticity and flexibility, compared to other parts of the allergens. Additionally, antibody paratopes display a higher surface plasticity before and after binding to the allergen, in contrast to the substantially more rigid epitope. Global and localized surface plasticity combined with common flexibility measures, i.e. RMSF and PCAs, allows to characterize and localize the epitope and paratope conformational diversity and gives valuable insights in molecular recognition of protein interfaces. Conclusion
We characterized the conformational diversity of antibody-allergen complexes and identified in all studied cases that conformational epitopes reveal less plasticity compared to other regions of the allergens. Additionally, we observed that in all analyzed examples allergen-antibody binding follows the paradigm of conformational selection, because even without the allergen present, the binding competent shape was frequently revisited. For one example, we investigated the role of mutations on the binding capacity to the antibody and to stabilizing ions and the results showed in agreement with experimental information that this substantially increased plasticity of the variant, which reveals a reduced binding capacity to both ions and the antibody. Besides describing changes in plasticity of allergens, we also present an example of an antibody which displays a significant decrease in surface plasticity upon affinity maturation. Taking the conformational diversity of allergens and antibodies into account allows to identify experimentally determined epitopes and to better understand basic principles of molecular recognition. This study has broad implications in antibody-allergen docking and in the field epitope prediction and design. Author Contributions

The conformational diversity and binding mechanisms of antibody-antigen complexes can be investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and experimental structural information. The hypothesis suggests that the conformational epitopes of allergens will exhibit less plasticity compared to other regions of the allergens, while the antibody paratopes will display higher surface plasticity before and after binding to the allergen.

Research Proposal:
The proposed research aims to investigate the conformational diversity and binding mechanisms of antibody-antigen complexes using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and experimental structural information. The study will focus on characterizing the surface plasticity of allergen epitopes and antibody paratopes in solution. The research will involve simulating various antibody-allergen complexes to identify the conformational diversity and binding mechanisms, and to determine the influence of mutations and affinity maturation on the surface plasticity of the complexes. The ultimate goal is to gain insights into the molecular recognition of protein interfaces and to contribute to the fields of antibody-allergen docking and epitope prediction and design."

T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement induces forma-
tion of multi-protein signalling complexes essential forregulating T-cell functions. Generation of a complex ofSLP-76, Nck and VAV1 is crucial for regulation of theactin machinery. We deﬁne the composition, stoichiome-
try and speciﬁcity of interactions in the SLP-76, Nck and
VAV1 complex. Our data reveal that this complex cancontain one SLP-76 molecule, two Nck and two VAV1molecules. A direct interaction between Nck and VAV1 ismediated by binding between the C-terminal SH3 domainof Nck and the VAV1 N-terminal SH3 domain. Disruption of
the VAV1:Nck interaction deleteriously affected actin poly-
merization. These novel ﬁndings shed new light on themechanism of actin polymerization after T-cell activation.The EMBO Journal (2010) 29,2315–2328. doi:10.1038/

Introduction
Actin polymerization in Tcells is induced after engagement of
the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). In addition to controlling
cellular shape and polarity, this process regulates vital T-cellresponses, such as T-cell activation, adhesion and prolifera-tion. Alterations in dynamic actin cytoskeletal rearrangementcan also result in immunodeﬁciency. Multiple signalling
cascades link the TCR to actin polymerization (Bubeck
Wardenburg et al, 1998; Bunnell et al, 2001; Cannon et al,
2001; Badour et al, 2003; Barda-Saad et al, 2005; Dombroski
et al, 2005; Nolz et al, 2006). Immediately after TCR engage-
ment, several protein tyrosine kinases are activated leading to
phosphorylation of TCR components and various effectormolecules (Kane et al, 2000). One of these effector proteins
is the transmembrane adapter, linker for activation of T cells
(LAT) (Zhang et al, 1998). LAT is rapidly phosphorylated on
conserved tyrosines and, once phosphorylated, directlybinds to the SH2 domains of several proteins, includingGrb2, Grb2-related adaptor protein (Gads) and phospholipaseCg1 (PLC g1).
The recruitment of SLP-76 also brings a number of addi-
tional associated molecules into LAT-nucleated signalling
complexes. SLP-76-binding proteins include, among others,the Rho-family GTPase exchange factor (GEF), VA V1, the Nckadapter molecule and the nucleation-promoting factors(NPFs) including the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome family pro-
tein (WASp), key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (Wu and
Koretzky, 2004; Smith-Garvin et al, 2009). Several lines of
evidence suggest that phosphorylation of SLP-76 is critical tobring VAV1 and Nck into proximity (Raab et al, 1997; Bubeck
Wardenburg et al, 1998; Zeng et al, 2003). VAV1 then acti-
vates the small G-proteins including Cdc42 (GTP-Cdc42) and
Rac (Rac-GTP) speciﬁcally at the site of TCR signalling,whereas Nck recruits NPFs to the same site (Buday et al,
2002; Tybulewicz, 2005). NPF activation leads to the activa-tion of the Arp2/3 complex, which induces the nucleation ofbranched actin ﬁlaments at the site of the T-cell/antigen-
presenting cell interface, and to the formation of the immu-
nological synapse (IS) (Fuller et al, 2003; Billadeau and
Burkhardt, 2006; Burkhardt et al, 2008; Dustin, 2008).
Structure-function studies of SLP-76 have shown the
importance of multiple SLP-76 domains in TCR signalling.
SLP-76 consists of at least four domains: (1) the N-terminal
sterile amotif (SAM) domain; (2) an acidic domain contain-
ing three tyrosine residues subject to phosphorylation: Y113(in humans, Y112 in mice), Y128 and Y145; (3) the centralproline-rich domain that mediates the interactions with Gadsand PLC g1 and (4) the C-terminal SH2 domain that binds to
the adhesion- and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein
(ADAP) and to the hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1)(Fang et al, 1996; Zeng et al, 2003; Wu and Koretzky, 2004;
Kliche et al, 2006; Koretzky et al, 2006).
It has been demonstrated that although phosphorylation of
Y113 and Y128 enables the binding of SLP-76 to either VAV1
or Nck, the interaction of SLP-76 with Nck is more dependenton phosphorylation of Y128 than Y113 (Wu et al, 1996;
Bubeck Wardenburg et al, 1998; Wunderlich et al, 1999;
Jordan et al, 2006). Y145 is important for optimal association
of SLP-76 with the inducible tyrosine kinase, Itk, a key
regulator of T-cell function (Wunderlich et al, 1999; Bunnell
et al, 2000; Clements, 2003; Dombroski et al
, 2005). Recent
studies using a panel of murine SLP-76 tyrosine mutantsdemonstrated that phosphorylation of Y112 and Y128 facil-itates the phosphorylation of Y145, suggesting a functional
hierarchy among SLP-76 tyrosines (Jordan et al , 2006).
However, to date, there are no deﬁnitive measurements ofbinding at these phosphorylation sites, and details of proteininteractions at this domain of SLP-76 are still lacking.

2315Earlier, we have taken a multi-dimensional approach to the
study of the binding interactions of multi-molecular com-plexes. For example, we used ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) to follow the interactions between Nck and
WASp, which leads to actin polymerization (Barda-Saad et al,
2005). In other studies, we measured thermodynamic para-meters and calculated the binding afﬁnity of LAT to the SH2-containing proteins Grb2, Gads and PLC g1 using isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) (Houtman et al, 2004, 2006, 2007).
Our studies provided a description of the highly cooperative
nature of the interactions of Gads, SLP-76 PLC g1 and LAT
during the formation of signalling complexes (Houtman et al,
2004, 2006). In one of these earlier studies, we focused on theinteractions of SLP-76 at its proline-rich central domain. In
the current work, we have turned to the SLP-76 acidic
domain, the site of tyrosine phosphorylation and binding ofV AV1, Nck and Itk. In this study, we take a multi-disciplinaryapproach by using molecular imaging, FRET analysis andbiophysical techniques to focus on the binding properties ofSLP-76, Nck and VAV1 and their multi-molecular interactions.
Our data reveal an unexpected stoichiometry of association
and an unexpected direct molecular association between Nckand V AV1. We show the functional importance of this directassociation and demonstrate the cooperative nature of themulti-molecular interaction, which is critical to the regulation
of actin dynamics in activated T cells.
Results
Evaluation of Nck and VAV1 binding to SLP-76 using ITC
Our study began with an analysis of Nck and VA V1 binding to
SLP-76. ITC experiments were performed with puriﬁed full-
length Nck and a large polypeptide fragment of V AV1 tomeasure their speciﬁcity of binding and binding afﬁnitiesto short or long synthesized SLP-76 phosphopeptides(Supplementary Figure S1A–C; Supplementary Table S1)
(Houtman et al, 2004, 2006; Ladbury, 2007). As detailed in
the Supplementary data, these studies show that at least twomolecules of V AV1 or Nck can associate with one molecule ofSLP-76. These data also imply that V AV1 and Nck can binddirectly.
Analytical ultracentrifugation studies of VAV1 and Nck
binding to SLP-76We turned to analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to further
pursue these complex-binding events, to conﬁrm higher-
order protein complex formation, and to determine whetherthere is cooperativity of binding at SLP-76 in the presence ofV AV1, Nck or both.
We used labelled V AV1-FAM (after verifying by ITC that
V AV1-FAM has the same binding constant to SLPpY128 as
unlabelled V AV1) (as described in detail in Supplementarydata), unlabelled Nck and rhodamine TAMRA end-labelledSLP-76 phosphopeptides. The multi-signal sedimentationcoefﬁcient distribution analysis then can display the distribu-tion of s-values (Sv) speciﬁcally of all species containing SLP-
76 (c
SLP(s)), VA V1 ( cVAV(s)) and Nck ( cNck(s)) coexisting in the
same sample.
We conducted preliminary experiments with SLP-76 pep-
tides alone (Figure 1A), with V AV1-FAM alone, and with Nckalone (Figure 1B). The preparation of VA V1-FAM showed
some contaminations with irreversible VAV1-FAM oligomers(B15), which could not be further puriﬁed. However, by
considering only c
SLP(s) from SLP-76-containing species,
V AV1:SLP-76 complexes could still be rigorously character-
ized. With free SLP-76 peptides sedimenting at B1.2 S, all
contributions to cSLP(s)42 S are peptides bound to V AV1 or
Nck. We recorded their weight-average s-value ( sw) to esti-
mate their average size (Table I). Only for the largestmixed complexes observed in experiments with ternary mix-tures (magenta line in Figure 1C) were the s-values higher
than the contaminants of VAV1 and Nck, so that the
sedimentation coefﬁcient c
VAV(s) and cNck(s) allowed us to
assess the stoichiometry of VAV1-FAM and Nck in the mixedcomplexes.
When we studied mixtures of VA V1:SLP-76 and Nck:SLP-
76 separately, we observed that the size of the complexes
with SLP-76 increased with the triple phosphorylated peptiderelative to both double phosphorylated complexes. This isillustrated in Figure 1A for VA V1 where for both doublyphosphorylated SLP-76 peptides the main c
SLP(s) peak was
found at s-values only slightly higher than that of V AV1-FAM
(B3 S, commensurate with the small increase of the complex
molar mass compared to the mass of VA V1-FAM alone).However, for pY113,128,145 c
SLP(s) exhibited a strong peak
at 4.2 S. It is not possible to directly conclude from the s-value
what the molar mass of this species is due to uncertainties of
hydrodynamic shape and because the reaction boundary of a
rapidly interacting system always sediments slower than thesedimentation coefﬁcient of the complex species. Assumingno drastic change in the translational friction coefﬁcientbetween the ligated and unligated protein, we could estimate
lower limits of the complex molar mass. For the VA V1—
SLPpY113, 128, 145 being B4.2 S, the complex is likely
460 kDa, that is containing two V AV1 molecules. It is highly
unlikely that this peak represents binding to VAV1 dimerfraction, as a much lower amount of the 4.2 S populationswere observed with the double phosphorylated SLP-76 pep-
tides despite their higher afﬁnity for V AV1 (Supplementary
Table S1). This result corroborates the ﬁnding by ITC that thetriple phosphorylated peptide offers two binding sites. Similarresults were found for Nck binding to SLP-76 peptides(Table I). As in the analogous experiments with VAV1, a
signiﬁcant shift of the peak s-value is observed, again sup-
porting the observation by ITC of two simultaneous Nck siteson the triple phosphorylated peptide.
Next we asked whether offering both V AV1 and Nck to the
SLP-76 peptides could lead to mixed triple complexes. In acontrol experiment with V AV1-FAM and Nck at 4 mM in the
absence of SLP-76, we only observed a slight increase
(B0.15 S) of the sedimentation coefﬁcients of the mixture
over the individual free components, indicating weak andrapidly reversible binding of the puriﬁed molecules in solu-tion (data not shown). Figure 1B shows the sedimentation
coefﬁcient distribution c
SLP(s) of SLPpY113, 145 containing
species in the presence of VA V1, Nck, and both V AV1 andNck. A slightly higher average sedimentation rate of thecomplexes is observed for the binary mixture with SLP-76:Nck relative to SLP-76:VAV1, likely because of the higher
molar mass of Nck ( B47 versus B32 kDa for V AV1).
However, a drastic shift was observed in the simultaneouspresence of both VA V1 and Nck under otherwise identicalconditions (magenta line, compared with blue and greenlines for the individual proteins), clearly demonstrating theSLP-76 signalling complex and actin polymerization

to bind only one protein.
The s-value of the main peak of the ternary mixture is
consistent with that of a 1:1:1 complex, and the absence of
theB3–3.5 S species predominant for the binary mixtures
suggests the possibility of cooperative binding of VAV1 andNck to SLP-76. Unfortunately, these data do not allow us todistinguish possible structural conﬁgurations and answerwhether both proteins bound by each making contact to
different sites on SLP-76, or VAV1 bound to Nck on a
preformed Nck:SLP-76 complex.
We have seen that, on one hand, phosphorylation at all
three tyrosines 113, 128 and 145 allows for two binding siteseach for V AV1 and Nck, and on the other hand, that VAV1 and
Nck can bind simultaneously, possibly cooperatively, to the
same double phosphorylated SLP-76 peptide. Thus, we askedwhether the presence of both proteins in solution with thetriple phosphorylated peptide could generate even largercomplexes. We conducted sedimentation experiments withthe SLPpY113, 128, 145 peptide with V AV1, Nck and
VAV1þNck (Figure 1C). Strikingly, a large shift in the peak
s-value of the c
SLP(s) distribution of the ternary mixture can
be discerned relative to either V AV1:SLP-76 or Nck:SLP-76, as
well as the absence of species with sedimentation coefﬁcientsofB4 S that were predominant in the binary mixtures. This
indicates the cooperative formation of larger mixed multi-protein complexes. The weighted-average s
wvalue of 5.6 S
corresponds (assuming a translational frictional coefﬁcient
similar to the free proteins) to molar masses 4107 kDa,
suggesting the presence of a complex with at least three, orpossibly four proteins per SLP-76 peptide. Interestingly, therelative peak areas of the different distributions suggest a2:2:1 V AV1:Nck:SLP-76 molar ratio (on average) for the 6 S
species. The data are not consistent with a complex com-
prised of multiple SLP-76 molecules associated with Nck andVAV1 at the measured ratio. For example, a dimer of SLP-76with Nck and VAV1 (with a ratio of 4:4:2) would have anapparent molecular weight of 350 kDa and would migrate at

&2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 14 |2010 2317410 S. Thus, our data unequivocally show the formation of a
mixed multi-protein complex on a multiply phosphorylatedSLP-76 peptide in vitro .
The formation of the Nck, VAV1 and SLP-76 triple
molecular complexThe preceding analysis of VAV1, Nck and SLP-76 resulted in
the determination of basic binding parameters and the con-
clusion that these proteins can interact to create a multi-molecular complex at the N-terminal region of SLP-76. Toindependently conﬁrm a multi-molecular complex simulta-neously containing V AV1, Nck and SLP-76, and to examinesuch complexes in vivo , we used a molecular imaging
approach (Barda-Saad et al, 2005; Houtman et al, 2006).
T cells expressing ﬂuorescently tagged versions of Nck orV AV1 were dropped onto a surface coated with a stimulatorymonoclonal antibody that binds the TCR. Activation resultedin recruitment of multiple signalling molecules, including the
tagged versions, to cluster at the points of contact with the
stimulatory surface. These structures are known as signallingmicroclusters. This process leads to activation of tyrosinekinases, intracellular calcium elevation and cellular spread-ing, all functions seen with normal T-cell activation.
To assess the possibility of a trimolecular complex contain-
ing V AV1, Nck and SLP-76 by imaging, we studied the binding
of these proteins by a pairwise analysis of colocalization and,more deﬁnitively, FRET (Barda-Saad et al, 2005; Wallrabe and
Periasamy, 2005; Sohn et al, 2006). We determined FRET
between yellow ﬂuorescent protein (YFP) and cyan ﬂuores-
cent protein (CFP) tagged to either VA V1, Nck or SLP-76. The
association of wild-type (wt) versions of these proteins instimulated T-cell lines was examined by using mutant T cells(J14 and J-VAV) lacking the expression of speciﬁc signallingproteins (SLP-76 and V AV1, respectively) versus their recon-
stituted counterparts (Yablonski et al, 1998; Cao et al, 2002).
Where mutant T cells were not available, as in the case ofNck, gene-targeting approaches to silence both Nck aand
Nckbusing small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used.
VAV proteins are not required for the association
of Nck to SLP-76Nck recruitment to signalling clusters has been observedearlier (Zeng et al, 2003; Barda-Saad et al, 2005). To deter-
mine whether Nck can bind to SLP-76 independently of VAV
proteins, we used the mutant Jurkat Tcell, J-VAV, which lacks
the expression of VA V1 protein. Both CFP-SLP-76 and YFP-Nck were then expressed in these cells (Figure 2A). FRETanalysis in live activated T cells showed that Nck associatedwith SLP-76 and was recruited to the TCR signalling complex
in the absence of VAV1. No differences in the FRET efﬁciency
was measured in J-VAV cells lacking V AV1 (22.7% ±2) com-
pared with J14 cells reconstituted with YFP-SLP-76(27.5%±5.5) ( Pp0.094). To eliminate the possibility that
V AV2 and VA V3 isoforms expressed in J-VAV cells recruit Nckto SLP-76, gene silencing of these isoforms was performed
and FRET efﬁciency between SLP-76 to Nck was measured
(Supplementary Figure S2A). Our results indicate that VAVproteins were not required for the stabilization of the mole-cular interaction between Nck and SLP-76 (Figure 2A;Supplementary Figure S2A). These results are consistent
with the earlier biophysical binding data.Nck is required for the recruitment of VAV1 to SLP-76
To test whether VA V1 binds SLP-76 without Nck, we used J14SLP-76-deﬁcient T cells expressing YFP-SLP-76 and VA V1-
CFP. Gene silencing was used to regulate Nck expression.
We used siRNA speciﬁc for the SH2 domains of Nck aandb
(Figure 2B). Treatment of YFP-SLP-76 VAV1-CFP, J14 withNck-speciﬁc siRNA resulted in B90% reduction in Nck
expression in comparison to almost no effect with irrelevantsiRNA (Figure 2B). When control siRNA oligos were used
(Figure 2C), FRET levels between SLP-76 and VAV1 were
readily detected (18.9% ±1.5). However, FRET efﬁciency
between SLP-76 and VAV1 was dramatically reduced(Pp0.000015) between these two proteins in Nck gene
silenced cells (3% ±2). These results indicate that optimal
V AV1 binding to SLP-76 in activated Jurkat Tcells requires the
presence of Nck.
The FRET data thus indicate that V AV1 binding to SLP-76
in vivo is dependent on the Nck–SLP-76 interaction. These
results in combination with our biophysical data, suggestinga VAV1:Nck:SLP-76 binding stoichiometry of 2:2:1 lead to two
important predictions. First, disruption of each of the two
speciﬁc sites of interaction between Nck and SLP-76 shouldpartially block VA V1 interaction with SLP-76, whereas dis-ruption of both sites would be more dramatic. Second, VAV1and Nck must directly interact. To test the ﬁrst prediction,
V AV1-deﬁcient J-VAV cells expressing VAV1-YFP were transi-
ently transfected with constructs expressing SLP-76 mutatedat tyrosine 113 (Y113F) or tyrosine 128 (Y128F) or at bothsites (Y113, 128F). FRETanalysis was performed to follow theinteraction between VAV1 and SLP-76 mutants compared
with VAV1 and SLP-76 wt. Our data indicate that point
mutation at each site (Y113F or Y128F) individually partiallyreduced the FRET efﬁciency between VAV1 and SLP-76,whereas a double mutation (Y113, 128F) dramaticallyabolished this interaction (Supplementary Figure S2B).Assuming that Nck binding to SLP-76 is required for V AV1–
SLP-76 interactions (Figure 2C), this result shows that each
Nck-binding site recruits a VA V1 molecule. This experimentthus also provides strong support for the biophysical results.Each of the two Nck sites supports binding to a VAV1molecule and therefore two VA V1 molecules and two Nck
molecules can bind SLP-76.
SLP-76 is not required for the molecular association
between Nck and VAV1
Our second prediction, that Nck binds VAV1 directly in cells,
was tested next. We used the T-cell spreading assay, todetermine the distribution of Nck and VAV1 in the presenceor absence of SLP-76. Nck-YFP and V AV1-CFP interactionswere examined in wt Jurkat E6.1 cells, SLP-76-deﬁcient J14
cells or in J14 cells reconstituted with wt SLP-76 (SLP-76 wt,
J14). Our results showed that stimulation of E6.1 cells stablyexpressing VA V1 and Nck resulted in the formation of signal-ling clusters containing both molecules (Figure 3A). In theabsence of SLP-76 (J14 cells), the distribution of Nck andV AV1 was altered. The proteins remained homogenously
dispersed in the cytosol and no clusters were observed.
These data are consistent with our earlier ﬁndings (Barda-Saad et al, 2005; Braiman et al, 2006), indicating altered Nck
and V AV1 recruitment to the TCR sites in the absence of SLP-76. Surprisingly, no signiﬁcant alterations ( Pp0.07) in the
FRET efﬁciency was measured between Nck and VAV1 in theSLP-76 signalling complex and actin polymerization

(J14) (Figure 3A). J14 cells reconstituted with SLP-76 demon-strated FRET efﬁciency of about 25.6% ±7.5 between Nck to
VAV1 similar to that observed in E6.1 (Figure 3A). As FRET
can occur between ﬂuorescent species separated no furtherthanB10 nm, detection of FRET between these two mole-
cules strongly suggests their direct interaction.
To conﬁrm a direct VAV1–Nck interaction, we subjected
cell lysates from E6.1, SLP-76-deﬁcient or VA V1-deﬁcient
T cells to immunoprecipitation with anti-Nck antibodyand blotting with anti-VAV1 antibody (Figure 3B;Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D). As a control for thespeciﬁcity of the immunoprecipitation, we used cell lysates ofVAV1-deﬁcient T cells. No non-speciﬁc binding was observed
between Nck to the anti-VAV1 beads (Figure S2C). The
protein level of VAV1 (the 122 kDa chimeric protein)was determined and found to be 1.4-fold higher in J14 thanthe overexpressed protein in E6.1 cells, however, similar(1.05-fold) to endogenous VA V1 (Supplementary Figure
S2D). In agreement with the imaging results, Nck coprecipi-tated with VA V1 both in stimulated and non-stimulated wt,
Jurkat E6.1 cells and in SLP-76-deﬁcient T cells, J14
(Figure 3B), indicating a constitutive interaction betweenthe two proteins independent of SLP-76.
To demonstrate that the interaction between Nck and
VAV1 occurs independently of the acidic domain of SLP-76,
we transiently expressed SLP-76 wt or SLP-76 mutated at
tyrosines 113, 128 and 145 (Y3F) in SLP-76-deﬁcientT cells, J14 cells. Cell lysates were prepared and immunopre-cipitated with anti-VAV1 and blotted with anti-Nck. Ourdata clearly indicate a constitutive interaction betweenVAV1 and Nck regardless of whether wt or Y3F SLP-76 is
expressed. The association of Nck and V AV1 seemed to be
increased in stimulated SLP-76 wt compared with J14 cellsthough the difference was not signiﬁcantly different(Figure 3C).

YFP-SLP-76 and transfected with CFP-Nck. V A V1-deﬁcient Jurkat J-V A V cells were cotransfected with CFP-SLP-76 and YFP-Nck. High FRETefﬁciency was observed in the presence, as well as in the absence, of V A V1 ( Pp0.094). ( B) J14 cells expressing YFP-SLP-76 CFP-Nck were

M Barda-Saad et al
The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 14 |2010 &2010 European Molecular Biology Organization 2320To conﬁrm this ﬁnding in normal non-transformed T cells,
coprecipitation of V AV1 with Nck was performed in humanperipheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). PBLs were activated as
described earlier (Astoul et al, 2003; Laurence et al, 2004;
Barda-Saad et al, 2005) with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. T-cell
lysates from unstimulated and stimulated cells were immuno-precipitated with the V AV1 antibody and probed with anti-Nck. Nck proteins could be detected in unstimulated cells,conﬁrming that Nck and V AV1 form a constitutive interaction
(Figure 3D). However, the relative amount of the complex
was higher in stimulated T cells than that in unstimulatedcells, suggesting that this complex is enhanced on T-cellstimulation and phosphorylation of SLP-76 in PBLs asdescribed earlier (Zeng et al, 2003). The lysates were thus
also probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody both to
conﬁrm phosphorylation of SLP-76 in the activated cellsand to demonstrate the absence of basal phosphorylation ofSLP-76 in unstimulated cells (Figure 3E). The results clearlyshow a constitutive association between Nck and VAV1 inunstimulated primary human T cells, which is further in-
duced on activation. Although a direct interaction between
Nck and VAV1 was documented by FRET analysis, we alsosubjected puriﬁed, recombinant Nck and the binding do-mains of VAV1 (SH3–SH2–SH3) to a direct binding analysis.As noted earlier, a weak binding was seen by AUC, and as
well by ITC analyses (data not shown).
The C-terminal SH3 domain of Nck is required for
its association with VAV1
We next sought to identify the sites mediating the interaction
between Nck and VAV1. Earlier, it was shown that V AV1 bindsto the Grb2 C-terminal SH3 domain through its own SH3domain located on the N-terminal side of the SH2 domain(Ye and Baltimore, 1994; Nishida et al, 2001). As a high
homology exists between the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb-
2 and SH3 domains of Nck (Supplementary Figure S3), weaimed to assess whether a similar interaction occurs betweenNck and VAV1.
To identify which of the three SH3 domains of Nck might
mediate the association with VAV1, the three individually
SH3-point mutated full-length Nck molecules were checked:
the N-terminal SH3 domain (Nck W38K or YFP-Nck*SH3(N)), the central SH3 domain (Nck W143K or YFP-Nck*SH3(mid)) and the C-terminal SH3 adjacent to theSH2 (Nck W229K or YFP-Nck*SH3(C)). The proteins were
ﬂuorescently tagged with YFP, and their association to VA V1-
CFP was measured in J14, SLP-76-deﬁcient T cells by FRETanalysis. Levels of YFP-Nck wt or mutants and V AV1-CFPwere appropriate for FRET analysis as detected by FACSanalysis (Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B, respectively)
and by western blot (Supplementary Figure S4C). FRET
efﬁciency between VAV1-CFP and YFP-Nck wt during T-cellspreading averaged about 32.9% ±2.3. Our results clearly
show a signiﬁcant reduction in the FRET efﬁciency betweenVAV1-CFP and the Nck W229K mutant throughout the spread-ing process (average of about 9.4% ±2.4) (Figure 4A).
However, no signiﬁcant differences were measured between
VAV1-CFP and the two other constructs, Nck W38K and NckW143K (Figure 4A and B; Supplementary Figure S4C).
To further examine the association between the C-terminal
SH3 domain of Nck with VAV1 and its independence on TCR
activation, cell lysates were produced from non-activated andactivated stable cells and coimmunoprecipitation between
VAV1 and YFP-Nck*SH3(C) or YFP-Nck wt was performed.Levels of YFP-Nck wt and YFP-Nck*SH3(C) were appro-
priate for immunoprecipitation as detected by FACS analysis
and western blot (Supplementary Figure S4D and S4E,respectively). Biochemical analysis (Figure 4C) conﬁrmed theimaging approach. Coimmunoprecipitation between Nckand VAV1 was abolished in the presence of the mutatedC-terminal SH3 domain of Nck. Also, the constitutive binding
between the two wt proteins was veriﬁed.
VAV1 N-terminal SH3 domain is required for the direct
interaction with Nck
To determine the site on VAV1 responsible for the interaction
with Nck, we again turned to the comparison with VAV1-Grb2binding. The interaction between V AV1 and Grb2 was shownto involve the proline-rich region located in the N-terminalSH3 domain of VA V1 (Nishida et al, 2001). Therefore, we
examined whether a mutation in the proline-rich region of the
N-terminal SH3 of VAV1 perturbs its binding to Nck. We useda mutant form of VAV1 and determined its association to Nckwt using biochemical coprecipitation and in vivo cellular
FRET analysis. To examine Nck and VAV1 signalling complex
formation in the absence of SLP-76, VAV1-YFP mutated at the
proline-rich site, V AV1 W637A was introduced into SLP-76-deﬁcient T cells (J14). No FRET efﬁciency was measuredbetween V AV1 W637A-YFP and CFP-Nck. In contrast, anaverage FRET efﬁciency of about 38.6% ±3.4 was observed
between VA V1 wt-YFP and CFP-Nck (Figure 5A). To verify
that the mutation at the V AV1 W637A disrupts Nck–VAV1
association, V AV1 W637A and VA V1 wt were introduced intoJ-VAV lacking the endogenous form of V AV1 (Figure 5B andC). Although the expression levels of V AV1 W637A-YFPwere found higher than the wt both by western blot and
FACS analysis (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S4F,
respectively) coprecipitation of VAV1 and Nck was dramati-cally reduced in the VA V1 W637A mutant cell lysate incontrast to a constitutive interaction detected between VAV1wt and endogenous Nck (Figure 5C). In combination, thedata shown in Figures 4 and 5 indicate that point mutations
in either the C-terminal Nck SH3 domain or the previously
known SH3-binding site in V AV1 disrupt the Nck–VA V1interaction.
The stoichiometric analysis with puriﬁed proteins in vitro
(Figure 1A–C; Supplementary Figure S1A–C) suggests that a
2:2:1 V AV1:Nck:SLP-76 complex can be detected. Such
a result can be explained only if there is a direct interactionbetween Nck and VAV1. To conﬁrm the above in vivo ﬁndings
and better integrate them with the model derived from ourbiophysical data, V AV1 wt or V AV1 W637A were expressed in
VAV1-deﬁcient, J-VA V cells. Cell lysates were prepared and
immunoprecipitated with anti-SLP-76 and blotted with anti-VAV1 or anti-Nck (Figure 5D). Our data clearly indicate aninteraction between V AV1 wt and SLP-76 in stimulated cells;however, this interaction is substantially reduced in J-V AVcells expressing the VAV1 W637A mutant protein in which the
Nck-binding site was abolished. The binding of Nck to SLP-76
is similar in both cell types. These data conﬁrm that thebinding of V AV1 to SLP-76 is mainly mediated through theinteraction of VAV1 to the Nck bound to SLP-76.
Next, we explored whether Nck–VAV1 interaction is phy-
siologically relevant. As V AV1 has been found to have aSLP-76 signalling complex and actin polymerization

&2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 14 |2010 2321critical function in the regulation of actin polymerization, we
explored if a point mutation in the VAV1-binding site for Nck
impairs actin polymerization. For this study, actin polyme-rization was detected by phalloidin staining in VAV1-deﬁcientT cells, J-VAV , and J-VAV cells reconstituted either with V AV1wt or with V AV1 W637A. Cells reconstituted with VA V1 wt
showed a prominent actin ring, similar to normal T cells.
Predictably, J-VAV cells exhibited very poor spreading andactin polymerization as quantiﬁed by ﬂuorescence intensity(41.88±3.4) (Figure 6A). Strikingly, a similar result was

(59.3±2.2), which showed a signiﬁcant difference from the
J-VAV cells expressing the VA V1 wt form (150.38 ±6.78)
(Pp0.00001). This difference was proven to be not because
of low transfection efﬁciency of the VA V1 forms or poor TCRexpression (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure S4F and datanot shown). To eliminate the possibility that the point muta-tion of V AV1 at the Nck-binding site altered TCR-inducedphosphorylation of signalling molecules such as PLC g1a s
determined in J-VAV (Cao et al, 2002), the phosphotyrosine
proﬁle of VAV1 W637A reconstituted J-VAV cell lysate wascompared with J-VAV reconstituted with VAV1 wt and wasfound to be qualitatively similar (data not shown). Theseresults were supported by the ability of J-VAV stably trans-
fected with wt VA V1 or the mutant V AV1 W637A to ﬂux Ca

and restore NFAT(IL2)-dependent luciferase expression
in response to OKT3 stimulation (data not shown and
Figure 6B). Calcium ﬂux of J-VAV reconstituted with VAV1wt was similar to VAV1 W637A and dramatically differentfrom that in J-VA V as published earlier (Reynolds et al, 2002)
(data not shown). Interestingly, expression of VAV1 W637Aalso retained a signiﬁcant ability to maintain TCR-induced
NFAT(IL2) activation similar to VAV1 wt ( Pp0.59). These
results suggest that although the VAV1 W637A mutantenables signal(s) for NFAT(IL2) activation (Figure 6B), itdelivers an impaired signal for actin polymerization.

M Barda-Saad et al
&2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 14 |2010 2323Discussion
Key features of T-cell activation after TCR engagement are the
activation of protein tyrosine kinases, the phosphorylation of
LAT on multiple tyrosine residues and the recruitment to LATof additional adapter molecules and enzymes. The multi-domain adapter SLP-76 is central to this process. Manystudies have focused on the binding properties of the SLP-
76 proline-rich region, which binds Gads and PLC g1 and the
C-terminal SH2 domain, which binds ADAP and HPK. In thisstudy, we focused on a detailed analysis of the SLP-76N-terminal acidic region and its three tyrosine residues. Thesethree tyrosine sites Y113, Y128 and Y145 are critical for TCRsignalling and thymocyte development (Jordan et al, 2006,
2008). Earlier studies have shown that Nck and VA V1, whichare known to bind SLP-76 at phosphorylated Y113 and Y128,
have a critical function in the activation and actin polymer-
ization pathways of T lymphocytes (Zeng et al, 2003). Nck
recruits NPFs such as WASp to the IS where they activate theArp2/3 complex and actin polymerization (Buday et al ,
2002), whereas V AV1 acts as a GEF of Rho-family GTPaseproteins that activate NPFs after stimulation (Tybulewicz,
2005). The existing model has been that cooperation between
these proteins is essential and necessary for a complete T-cellimmune response. This model is mainly based on biochemi-cal studies, suggesting that SLP-76 functions as a necessary
Figure 6 The N-terminal SH3 domain of V A V1 is necessary for an efﬁcient actin polymerization. ( A) J-V A V cells were reconstituted with V A V1
W637A mutant or V A V1 wt. Cells were seeded over a stimulatory coverslip pre-coated with anti-CD3 antibody then ﬁxed 5 min into thespreading process and their actin polymerization measured by phalloidin staining. The integration of ﬂuorescence intensity of cells labelledwith phalloidin is presented. The results were compared with J-V A V cells. Different cell panels are presented. Three independent experimentswere performed. ( B) J-V A V cell lines stably expressing V A V1 wt or V A V1 W637A mutant or vector were transiently cotransfected with an NFAT
luciferase reporter plasmid. After 16 h, the cells were incubated for 6 h in tissue culture medium alone (unstimulated), with plate-bound
monoclonal antibody to CD3, or with a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. Cells were then lysed andassayed for luciferase activity as described in Materials and methods. All values were normalized to internal Renilla controls. The results areexpressed as a fraction of the activity obtained on stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. No signiﬁcant difference was found between V A V1 wtand V A V1 W637A mutant cells ( Pp0.59). The results are the average of ﬁve independent experiments.SLP-76 signalling complex and actin polymerization

Wardenburg et al, 1998; Zeng et al, 2003).
This model was generated primarily using coimmunopre-
cipitation, which is powerful, but limited. In our current
work, we used ITC techniques to measure the afﬁnity,stoichiometry and speciﬁcity of Nck and VA V1 binding tosites of tyrosine phosphorylation on SLP-76. AUC was usedto further explore the stoichiometry of the complex and toaddress the potential cooperativity of protein binding. These
experiments were performed using puriﬁed full-length Nck
and a large polypeptide fragment of VAV1 containing itsinteraction domains to test binding to SLP-76 phosphopep-tides. Finally, molecular imaging techniques were used todemonstrate intramolecular interactions in vivo . This analy-
sis including FRET was supported by gene silencing and
conﬁrmatory biochemical experiments.
ITC analyses of VA V1 and Nck binding to short phospho-
peptides (17-mers) with sequences centred at the three SLP-76 phosphotyrosines showed that VA V1 and Nck both bind atpY113 and pY128. There is no binding of VAV1 to pY145; Nck
binds this site with low afﬁnity. Unfortunately, our inability
to purify Itk precluded studies of its binding to the pY145 sitewhere it is thought to bind.
Additional results emerged during the study of longer
peptides (49-mers) made with the SLP-76 sequence and
containing two or three phosphorylated tyrosines. The thermo-
dynamic analysis performed with the SEDPHAT software(Houtman et al, 2007) revealed that only one molecule of
either VA V1 or Nck bound to phosphopeptides containing twophosphoproteins, either pY113 or pY128 with pY145.
Surprisingly, only one molecule of VAV1 bound the doubly
phosphorylated long peptide containing the two sites, pY113and pY128, which are each alone capable of binding VAV1.Also of note was that two molecules of either V AV1 or Nckbound the triply phosphorylated long peptides. We cannotconclude that both pY113 and pY128 are occupied in these
peptides, though that is what we would expect. However, we
can conclude that phosphorylation at Y145 inﬂuences thebinding, and it at least for the case of Nck binding, phos-phorylation on this site is required for the 2:1 (Nck:SLP-76)stoichiometry.
AUC conﬁrmed our ITC results and enabled us to probe
higher-order complex formation. V AV1 and Nck individuallymixed with doubly phosphorylated SLP-76 showed sedimen-tation proﬁles, suggesting a stoichiometry of binding of 1:1.VAV1 or Nck binding to the triply phosphorylated peptidesgenerated an additional peak with a greater s-value consistent
in both cases with the binding of two molecules to this
peptide. These data are consistent with the results of theITC analysis.
The strength of the multi-signal sedimentation velocity
method is the capacity to track the inclusion of several
molecular species in multi-molecular complexes. Thus, a
mixture of V AV1 and Nck added to the doubly phosphorylatedSLPpY113, 145 phosphopeptide resulted in a marked shift insedimentation proﬁle consistent with both Nck and VAV1binding to the SLP-76 phosphopeptide with a 1:1:1 stoichio-
metry. The mechanism of binding, that is, whether both
proteins bind to the two sites or whether a complex of thetwo binds to one site cannot be determined. The AUCsedimentation of the mix of VAV1 and Nck with the triplyphosphorylated peptide was even more striking. In this case,the sedimentation pattern suggests three or even four mole-
cules bound to the phosphopeptide. In the latter case, thebinding stoichiometry of V AV1 to Nck to peptide was likely
2:2:1. From this result, one would have to conclude that Nck
and VA V1 interacted directly in the complex even though weonly observed a weak interaction of these proteins in theabsence of SLP-76 with puriﬁed preparations. Moreover, oneand perhaps two Nck–VAV1 complexes would bind SLP-76,one at pY113 and one at pY128, with pY145 again in some
way enabling these binding events.
We turned to molecular imaging and speciﬁcally to FRET
analysis to further study the binding properties of theseproteins in intact, living cells. Nck binding to SLP-76 wasshown to be independent of V AV1 as the level of FRET
efﬁciency between Nck and SLP-76 was unaffected in V AV1-
deﬁcient cells. It is important to emphasis the point that ourdata did not support an interaction between Nck to VAV2and/or VAV3, eliminating the involvement of these proteinsin the recruitment of Nck to SLP-76 in the absence of VA V1.
In our in vitro studies, V AV1 binding to SLP-76 was readily
detected. Surprisingly, in vivo binding of VAV1 to SLP-76 was
very weak in the absence of Nck. We note that for technicalreasons, we used a large polypeptide fragment of V AV1 forour binding studies and not the full-length protein. Thisdifference and the possibility of multiple, cooperative-binding
events in vivo in the setting of numerous other binding events
may account for this difference in the in vitro and in vivo
results.
As V AV1 interaction with SLP-76 in vivo is dependent on
Nck binding, we tested the function of the individual Nck-
binding sites on SLP-76 for V AV1 binding. FRET efﬁciency
between SLP-76 and V AV1 molecules tagged with ﬂuorescentproteins was detected in V AV1-deﬁcient T cells (J-VAV cells).The interaction between these proteins decreased wheneither the SLP-76Y113F or SLP-76Y128F mutant was used.When we mutated both sites (Y113 and Y128), the FRET
efﬁciency between SLP-76 and V AV1 was dramatically re-
duced. Thus, each of the two SLP-76 phosphotyrosine resi-dues that bind Nck contributes to V AV1 recruitment. FRETwas not completely abolished with the mutation of Y113 andY128, so a weak interaction of Nck at phosphorylated Y145 is
possible.
Further analysis revealed that the Nck requirement for
VAV1 binding reﬂected the fact that Nck interacts directlywith V AV1. This association depends on binding betweenthe C-terminal SH3 domain of Nck and proline residues in theN-terminal V AV1 SH3 domain. Our conclusion from the
imaging studies of the Nck–VAV1 interaction shed light on
the AUC results. We suggest that it is likely that twoNck–VA V1 dimers bind phosphorylated SLP-76 through theinteraction of the Nck SH2 domain with SLP-76 (Figure 7A).However, based on the ITC data, we do not rule out the
possibility that minor fraction of VAV1 directly associate to
SLP-76 after TCR stimulation as suggested by Wu et al(1996)
(Figure 7B). The question of whether multiple SLP-76 mole-cules ",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the direct interaction between Nck and VAV1 and its impact on actin polymerization in T cells.,"Research hypothesis: The direct interaction between Nck and VAV1 mediates the binding of these proteins to SLP-76, and disruption of this interaction will affect actin polymerization in T cells.

Research proposal: This study aims to investigate the direct interaction between Nck and VAV1 and its impact on actin polymerization in T cells. The research will involve in vitro and in vivo experiments to characterize the binding properties of Nck and VAV1 to SLP-76, and to determine the functional importance of this direct association. The study will also explore the cooperative nature of the multi-molecular interaction and its critical role in the regulation of actin dynamics in activated T cells. The findings from this research will provide new insights into the mechanism of actin polymerization after T-cell activation and may have implications for understanding T-cell function and immune responses."

Therapeutic antibody development requires selection and engineering of molecules with high
afﬁnity and other drug-like biophysical properties. Co-optimization of multiple antibody
properties remains a dif ﬁcult and time-consuming process that impedes drug development.
Here we evaluate the use of machine learning to simplify antibody co-optimization for aclinical-stage antibody (emibetuzumab) that displays high levels of both on-target (antigen)and off-target (non-speci ﬁc) binding. We mutate sites in the antibody complementarity-
determining regions, sort the antibody libraries for high and low levels of af ﬁnity and non-
speci ﬁc binding, and deep sequence the enriched libraries. Interestingly, machine learning
models trained on datasets with binary labels enable predictions of continuous metrics thatare strongly correlated with antibody af ﬁnity and non-speci ﬁc binding. These models illus-
trate strong tradeoffs between these two properties, as increases in af ﬁnity along the co-
optimal (Pareto) frontier require progressive reductions in speci ﬁcity. Notably, models
trained with deep learning features enable prediction of novel antibody mutations that co-optimize af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity beyond what is possible for the original antibody library.
These ﬁndings demonstrate the power of machine learning models to greatly expand the
exploration of novel antibody sequence space and accelerate the development of highlypotent, drug-like antibodies.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31457-3 OPEN

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:3788 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31457-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11234567890():,;Antibody therapeutics are being used to treat human dis-
orders ranging from cancer and autoimmune diseases to
allergies and neurodegenerative diseases1–3. The success
of antibody therapeutics is due in large part to their highlyattractive molecular properties, including their high af ﬁnities,
long half-lives, potent effector functions, and excellent biophysi-
cal properties (e.g., high stability and solubility)
4–6. However, it is
well known that antibody candidates selected from immunization
or in vitro library sorting typically have a wide range of bio-
physical properties, such as diverse solubilities and viscosities in
common formulation conditions7–14. In many cases, antibody
candidates with the highest bioactivities exhibit one or more
undesirable biophysical properties that impede production, for-
mulation and/or delivery. This is often discovered late in the
developmental process, after substantial investment of limited
resources, and can compromise the therapeutic potential of
otherwise promising candidates9,12,15. Therefore, there is a need
for antibody engineering methods to improve their biophysical
properties while maintaining high af ﬁnity and bioactivity, espe-
cially during early stages of development. Unfortunately, it is
commonly observed that improving a given sub-optimal antibody
property, such as speci ﬁcity or solubility, results in de ﬁcits in
other properties, such as af ﬁnity16–22. These strong tradeoffs are
often due to the central role of the complementarity-determining
regions (CDRs) of antibodies in strongly impacting both their
afﬁnities and biophysical properties18,23–25.
Therefore, there is signi ﬁcant need for simple and robust
methods for predicting CDR mutations that co-optimize antibody
afﬁnity and various biophysical properties with minimal experi-
mentation. Encouragingly, advances in high-throughput evalua-
tion of antibody properties using a combination of display
technologies (e.g., phage and yeast-surface display) and deep
sequencing have enabled the generation of large datasets that link
multisite antibody mutations, such as mutations in multiple
CDRs, with different levels of a given property (e.g., high and low
levels of af ﬁnity, stability or speci ﬁcity)26–32. However, these
datasets have been substantially underused due to shortcomingsin extracting meaningful features from antibody primary
sequences and incorporating them into models that accurately
predict different levels of a given antibody property. Conventional
methods of analyzing such deep sequencing datasets typically use
frequencies or enrichment ratios to identify promising antibody
mutants, but these approaches fail to make use of the large
amount of available antibody sequence information and, in some
cases, only result in modest ability to identify antibodies with
large improvements in properties such as af ﬁnity
23,33. These
approaches are typically limited to the analysis of antibody var-
iants observed in the sequenced libraries, which represent an
extremely small fraction of maximal sequence space, even for
antibody mutations only in the CDRs. An exception is a reported
method that predicts enrichment ratios31.
One logical and simple approach for using the vast amount of
sequence information obtained from antibody library deep
sequencing is to encode the amino acid sequences as sequence-
identity vectors ( e.g., one-hot encoded antibody sequences) to
build predictive models. Indeed, models developed using this
approach are often highly accurate for predicting the classi ﬁcation
of antibody properties, such as low or high af ﬁnity34–36. However,
classi ﬁcation imposes binary labels on continuous properties, and
intra-class variability such as high versus very high afﬁnity is vital
to antibody optimization. Therefore, it would be signi ﬁcant if
methods could be developed for predicting continuous metrics
that are strongly correlated with antibody properties based only
on binary measurements of an experimentally tractable number
of antibody sequences. Moreover, it would also be signi ﬁcant if
such methods could generalize to novel mutational space,including at novel CDR sites not mutated in the original libraries,
to greatly expand the fraction of the maximal sequence space
explored during antibody optimization.
In this work, we have sought to address both outstanding chal-
lenges in order to co-optimize the af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity (non-
speciﬁc binding) of a clinical-stage antibody (emibetuzumab37).
This antibody is speci ﬁc for c-Met [also known as tyrosine-protein
kinase Met or hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR)] and
reached phase II clinical trials for the treatment of non-small cell
lung cancer. Previous work has revealed that the high levels of non-
speciﬁc binding for emibetuzumab are primarily due to the heavy
chain CDRs38. Given that heavy chain CDRs also play a central role
in mediating antibody af ﬁnity, we reasoned that CDR mutations in
the heavy chain of emibetuzumab would exhibit strong tradeoffs
between emibetuzumab on-target (af ﬁnity) and off-target (non-
speciﬁc) binding. Therefore, we expected that co-optimized anti-
body variants with both high af ﬁnity and low non-speci ﬁcb i n d i n g
would be extremely rare and require advanced methods to identify
them. Moreover, we expected that it would be important to develop
predictive models that can learn from large but sparsely sampled
antibody CDR libraries and predict antibody properties for novel
CDR mutants not sampled in the original libraries to identify rare
co-optimized variants. Herein, we report an integrated experimental
and computational approach that combines deep sequencing,
machine learning, and high-throughput experimental methods to
identify co-optimized therapeutic antibody variants, including var-
iants with superior combinations of af ﬁnity and non-speci ﬁc
binding relative to a parental, clinical-stage antibody (Fig. 1).
Results
Conventional analysis of deep sequencing data is poorly pre-
dictive of co-optimal emibetuzumab variants . Toward our goal
of identifying co-optimized emibetuzumab variants with high
afﬁnity and speci ﬁcity (low non-speci ﬁc binding), we designed a
large antibody sub-library (~107variants) by mutating sites in the
heavy chain CDRs that were predicted previously to mediate non-
speciﬁc binding (Supplementary Fig. 1)38. We sampled the wild-
type residue and ﬁve mutations at eight sites distributed across
heavy chain CDRs 1 (one site), 2 (four sites) and 3 (three sites)
that are predicted to reduce non-speci ﬁc binding. Next, we dis-
played the library on the surface of yeast as single-chain Fab
fragments and sorted the library via magnetic-activated cell
sorting (MACS, rounds 1 –2) against the antigen (HGFR) to
remove fragmented or non-displaying antibodies. The MACS-
sorted libraries were then sorted by ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS, round 3) for high levels of antigen binding and
high and low levels of non-speci ﬁc binding to two polyspeci ﬁcity
reagents (ovalbumin39and soluble membrane proteins isolated
from CHO cells15,40,41; Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, we deep
sequenced the input and FACS-sorted libraries and selected 4000
of the most frequently observed antibody mutants that were
observed in both the af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity selections for further
analysis (see Methods for more details).
To evaluate our ability to predict antibody mutants with high
afﬁnity and low levels of non-speci ﬁc binding, we next Sanger
sequenced 125 mutants from the FACS-sorted libraries and
evaluated their relative levels of antigen and non-speci ﬁc binding
on the surface of yeast. Although it is logical to assume that
antibody mutants which are most enriched (relative to the input)
or most frequently observed will display superior properties, we
found that this was generally not the case, in line with previous
work29,42,43, although some exceptions have been observed31,44.
We observed a lack of statistically signi ﬁcant positive correlations
between antigen binding and frequency (Spearman ’sρof 0.23
andpvalue of 0.08) or enrichment ratio ( ρof−0.01 and pvalueARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31457-3

observed a lack of statistically signi ﬁcant negative correlations
between non-speci ﬁc binding and frequency ( ρof−0.16 and p
value of 0.14) for negative non-speci ﬁc binding selections
(Supplementary Fig. 3). While we did observe a signi ﬁcant
negative correlation between non-speci ﬁc binding and enrich-
ment ratio ( ρof−0.47 and pvalue of 6 × 10−6), the lack of a
corresponding signi ﬁcant correlation for af ﬁnity prevents the use
of enrichment ratios for reliably identifying antibody variants that
are co-optimal for both high af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity.
Prediction of Pareto optimal antibody variants . We next eval-
uated the information contained in our selected dataset of
4000 sequences by analyzing the enrichment of library mutationsin the positive sorts relative to the negative sorts (Fig. 2). We
noticed strong enrichment of the wild-type residues for both the
high af ﬁnity and high non-speci ﬁc binding selections, particularly
for Y33 in HCDR1 and R50 and R55 in HCDR2. Surprisingly,
wild-type residues W97 and Y102 in HCDR3 were not enriched
in the af ﬁnity selections, suggesting opportunities for further
antibody af ﬁnity optimization.
To preserve this information for model development, we chose
to encode the antibody V Hsequences as one-hot encoded binary
vectors to capture the presence or absence of mutations at each
site in our library. We hypothesized that classi ﬁcation algorithms
with architectures that learn weights for these individual features
would enable not only accurate predictions of property class (e.g.,
high vs. low af ﬁnity) but also accurate predictions of continuous
property values (e.g., high vs. very high af ﬁnity).

Fig. 1 Overview of antibody library sorting, deep sequencing, and machine learning methods used to co-optimize the af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity of
a therapeutic antibody. A clinical-stage antibody (emibetuzumab) was mutated at eight positions in three heavy chain CDRs, and the antibody libraries
were sorted using yeast surface display and magnetic- and ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting for high af ﬁnity and high and low levels of non-speci ﬁc
binding. The sorted libraries were deep sequenced, and the resulting antibody sequences were used to train models for predicting metrics correlated with
antibody af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity (non-speci ﬁc binding) using different types of molecular features. These features included antibody sequences encoded as
binary vectors, physicochemical features, and deep learning features. The resulting models were used not only to predict the classi ﬁcation of antibody
afﬁnity and speci ﬁcity (e.g., high or low af ﬁnity), but also continuous metrics correlated with each property to predict intraclass variability (e.g., high vs.
very high af ﬁnity). The model predictions were also used to identify antibody mutants in the library at the Pareto frontier that maximize antibody af ﬁnity to
different extents while minimizing tradeoffs due to reduced speci ﬁcity (i.e., increased non-speci ﬁc binding). Some of the models, which generalized to novel
mutational space, were used to identify antibodies with even greater improvements in af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity than was possible in the experimentally sorted
libraries.NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31457-3 ARTICLE
NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2022) 13:3788 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31457-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of relatively
simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models to predict both
antibody af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity (Fig. 3). LDA models predict
binary classi ﬁcations by ﬁrst projecting high-dimensional data
into a continuous one-dimensional space to optimize classi ﬁca-
tion accuracy, and then ﬁnding the optimal classi ﬁcation cutoff
within the one-dimensional space. We reasoned that the scalings
learned by the models would re ﬂect the different levels of
mutational enrichment, and that the resulting one-dimensional
feature-space predictions, referred to as projections, would
correlate with the continuous values of antibody af ﬁnity and
speciﬁcity that were measured experimentally.
Therefore, we trained LDA models to predict deep sequencing
labels using the one-hot encoded features, herein referred to as
OneHot models. The models were trained to predict each
antibody property using ﬁve-fold cross-validation methods
(80%:20% training:test data splits) to prevent over ﬁtting.
Encouragingly, the OneHot models strongly classi ﬁed the af ﬁnity
and speci ﬁcity of the antibody mutants in the deep sequencing
datasets, as both models resulted in 93% accuracy for classifying
antibody af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity (Fig. 3A, B). These accuracies are
similar to those obtained using a simpler classi ﬁcation algorithm
(k-nearest neighbors) that makes predictions based on similarity
to training set data alone (83% for af ﬁnity and 89% for speci ﬁcity;
Supplementary Fig. 4). This ﬁnding is consistent with our
experience analyzing similar datasets with diverse types of models
and demonstrates that classi ﬁcation of antibody properties such
as af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity based on deep sequencing data is a
relatively simple task and weakly dependent on the type of model
used for the predictions.
However, predictions of property class (e.g., high vs. low
afﬁnity) are of limited use for identifying antibody mutants with
the best combinations of properties, including af ﬁnity and
speciﬁcity. Inspection of the LDA projections for each antibody
property revealed both signi ﬁcant intraclass variability and that
the values at either extreme predicted each property withthe highest accuracies (Fig. 3A, B), suggesting that the LDA
projections may be useful for predicting not only interclass
differences (e.g., classi ﬁcation of low versus high af ﬁnity) but also
intraclass differences (e.g., high versus very high af ﬁnity).
Therefore, we also evaluated the ability of the model projections,
which are continuous metrics and not actual property values, to
describe the relative af ﬁnity and non-speci ﬁc binding values for
experimental measurements obtained using yeast surface display
for the set of 125 antibody mutants that were isolated via Sanger
sequencing after library sorting (Fig. 3C, D). None of these
antibody mutants were present in the set of 4000 antibodies used
for training and testing. Strikingly, we observed strong correla-tions between the model predictions and the experimental
measurements, including Spearman correlation coef ﬁcients of
0.87 for af ﬁnity ( pvalue of 10
−39) and 0.67 for non-speci ﬁc
binding ( pvalue of 10−17). These encouraging results indicate
that continuous metrics correlated with each property can be
predicted for the sequences in the library with relatively high
accuracy, including for the 4000 sequences used in the training
process.
The simplicity of the LDA models naturally raises the question
of whether more complex machine learning models would lead to
improved performance for predicting antibody af ﬁnity and
speciﬁcity metrics. Therefore, we developed neural network
models to predict af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity metrics. Each
model included a dense layer with a single node to create ﬁnal
projections that could be used as metrics for correlation with each
property and identi ﬁcation of optimal classi ﬁcation cutoffs
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Notably, the neural network models
performed similarly to the LDA models. The classi ﬁcation
prediction accuracies were the same for both models for af ﬁnity
and speci ﬁcity, consistent with our general observation that the
accuracy of classi ﬁcation of antibody properties based on deep
sequencing data is weakly dependent on model complexity. For
the prediction of continuous antibody properties, we observed the
same performance for predicting antigen binding (Spearman's ρ

predicting non-speci ﬁc binding ( ρof 0.70 compared to 0.67 for
the LDA model).
Given the strong performance of simple and easy-to-
implement LDA models, we next plotted the LDA modelprojections of af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity for each of the 4,000
antibody sequences to directly visualize the tradeoffs between the
two properties on a continuous scale (Fig. 4A). Notably, the
emibetuzumab variants showed strong tradeoffs between both
properties, as increases in af ﬁnity typically required reductions in
speciﬁcity and vice versa. This analysis also revealed the Pareto
frontier for the antibody library, which corresponds to the set of
co-optimal antibody variants with the maximum af ﬁnities at each
level of speci ﬁcity. Notably, the wild-type antibody is not at the
Pareto frontier and, therefore, it may be possible to increase both
afﬁnity and speci ﬁcity at the same time.
To evaluate the predictions of Pareto optimal antibody
variants, we next identi ﬁed and produced 41 antibody mutants
(as soluble IgGs) that were predicted to be at or near the Pareto
frontier (Fig. 4A) and experimentally evaluated their levels of
antigen (Fig. 4B) and non-speci ﬁc (Fig. 4C) binding. Encoura-
gingly, we ﬁnd that the model predictions are strongly predictive
of afﬁnity (Spearman ’sρof 0.72 and pvalue of 8 × 10
−8; Fig. 4B)
and speci ﬁcity ( ρof 0.77 and pvalue of 3 × 10−9; Fig. 4C), whichis not observed for conventional analysis using enrichment ratios
and frequencies of the antibody mutants (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Moreover, we ﬁnd that simultaneous improvement of both
binding properties is achieved for more than one-third of the
antibodies (37%; Fig. 4D). We also observed strong tradeoffs
between af ﬁnity and non-speci ﬁc binding, as most antibodies
(87%) with high af ﬁnity (greater than wild type) also displayed
relatively high non-speci ﬁc binding (>50% of wild type).
Conversely, most antibodies (91%) with large reductions in
non-speci ﬁc binding (<50% of wild type levels) displayed reduced
afﬁnity (less than wild type). This demonstrates the strong
intrinsic tradeoffs between antibody af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity for
variants with heavy chain CDR mutations that include sites
strongly involved in both on- and off-target interactions.
Prediction of novel mutations that further co-optimize anti-
bodies . We identi ﬁed a lead candidate (EM1) for further opti-
mization that displayed an attractive combination of increased
antigen binding (1.20x of wild type) and reduced non-speci ﬁc
binding (0.51x of wild type; Fig. 4D). We also selected additional
clones for further mutagenesis, although to a more limited extent,
to investigate the potential for optimizing antibody mutants with
a diverse range of properties. We sought to predict novel CDR      Affinity projection

improve both the af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity of EM1 and related
variants beyond the Pareto frontier identi ﬁed for the ﬁrst-
generation library. This is not possible using the OneHot models
because they are de ﬁned based on the sequences of the antibody
mutants in the library and subsequent models would be insen-
sitive to variations at novel sites in the CDRs. However, we rea-
soned that it may be possible to predict bene ﬁcial novel
mutations using models that incorporate other types of molecular
features that are based on the entire V Hdomain.
Therefore, we evaluated two additional sets of molecular
features based on antibody V Hdomains for integration into
models that predict the impacts of novel mutations on antibody
afﬁnity and speci ﬁcity. The ﬁrst set of features are Uni ﬁed
Representation (UniRep) features, which are deep learning
features obtained from a neural network trained on over twenty
million unlabeled protein sequences to perform next amino acid
prediction35. A compelling aspect of these features is that they are
not biased by assumptions regarding which molecular features are
most important for antibody af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity. We used the
previously reported 64-unit neural network to generate 64
UniRep features per antibody35. The second set of features,
which we refer to as PhysChem features, are 26 physicochemical
features that are based on the V Hdomain sequence, including the
isoelectric point, average residue hydrophobicity, and number of
speciﬁc amino acids.We next used the UniRep and PhysChem features to build
LDA models for predicting both antibody af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity
metrics (Supplementary Fig. 7), as we did for the OneHot features
(Fig. 3A, B), and ﬁrst evaluated their ability to classify the
emibetuzumab mutants in the deep sequencing datasets.
Encouragingly, we observed strong accuracies for classifying
antibody af ﬁnity, with modestly higher accuracy for the UniRep
model (91%) relative to the PhysChem model (85%; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7). Likewise, we also observed strong accuracies for
classifying antibody speci ﬁcity (92% for both models). These
classi ﬁcation accuracies were similar to those obtained for
k-nearest neighbors models using the same features (80 –86%
for af ﬁnity and 88 –91% for speci ﬁcity; Supplementary Fig. 8). We
also tested whether LDA projections trained on UniRep or
PhysChem features correlated with continuous measures of
afﬁnity and speci ﬁcity (Supplementary Fig. 7), as we did for the
OneHot model (Fig. 3C, D). Encouragingly, our results were
highly similar for the three sets of features, as model predictions
were strongly correlated with experimental measurements of
afﬁnity and speci ﬁcity.
We also evaluated the ability of the UniRep and PhysChem
LDA models to predict property metrics of soluble IgGs, as we
did for the OneHot LDA models (Fig. 4). We observed similar
(albeit modestly lower) Spearman correlation coef ﬁcients between
model predictions and experimental measures of af ﬁnity (0.66 for
UniRep and 0.68 for PhysChem relative to 0.72 for OneHot) andC

0.77 for OneHot; Supplementary Fig. 7). We also repeated this
analysis using neural network models and observed similar
performance relative to the OneHot models for af ﬁnity (0.75 for
UniRep relative and 0.68 for PhysChem relative to 0.72 for
OneHot) and speci ﬁcity (0.70 for UniRep and 0.71 for PhysChem
relative to 0.77 for OneHot; Supplementary Fig. 9). Overall, these
results demonstrate that both simple (LDA) and more complex
(neural net) models are capable of predicting continuous metrics
that are strongly correlated with antibody properties based on
both simple (OneHot) feature sets that are limited to the observed
mutations in the sequenced library and more complex
(PhysChem and UniRep) feature sets that can be potentially
used to predict novel mutations features.
As a preliminary test of the generality of the UniRep and
PhysChem LDA models, we evaluated the ability of the models to
predict the impacts of CDR mutations on antibody af ﬁnity and
speciﬁcity for residues that were selectively omitted during the
training process, which we refer to as a leave-one-out analysis45.
We performed such analysis by training the models on new sets
of antibodies (4,000 sequences) that lack information about a
given wild-type residue at one of the eight mutated CDR sites
(i.e., no antibodies with the wild-type residue at a given CDR site
were included in the training process). Next, the trained models
were tested on antibodies that have the corresponding wild-type
CDR residue regardless of the identity of the residues at the other
seven mutated CDR sites (Supplementary Fig. 10). While the
UniRep and PhysChem models both performed reasonably well,
the UniRep models displayed the best overall performance. We
repeated this process by training LDA models that lack
information about the most common residue at each CDR site
that was not wild type and observed that the UniRep models
again displayed the best overall performance.
Encouraged by these results, we next directly tested if our
models could generalize to novel mutational space (Fig. 5).
Therefore, we predicted single mutations (29 unique variants)
that had not been sampled in the original library, includingmutations at 15 novel CDR sites in HCDR2 and HCDR3. These
mutations were primarily predicted for the EM1 clone (20 of 29
variants), but also for seven additional clones with the goal of
generating a wide range of predictions and experimental
measurements. We reasoned that focusing on evolutionarily
conserved mutations would be most productive, and only
considered predicted mutations with relatively high conservation
(Blosum62 substitution scores ≥0; see Methods for more
detail)
46. The antibody mutants were selected based on the
UniRep predictions and, notably, some of them were predicted to
exceed the Pareto frontier of the ﬁrst-generation library (Fig. 5A,
inset of left panel). Moreover, the predictions sample a range of
increases in predicted af ﬁnity or speci ﬁcity or both. The
PhysChem models predict different af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity
metrics for the same mutants, which led to different distributions
of each property (Fig. 5B, left panel).
Experimental validation of novel mutation predictions .T ot e s t
these predictions, we generated the 29 antibody variants as soluble
IgGs and evaluated their relative levels of af ﬁnity and non-speci ﬁc
binding (Fig. 5). Encouragingly, we observed signi ﬁcant correla-
tions between the UniRep LDA predictions and both antibody
afﬁnity (Spearman ’sρof 0.46 and pvalue of 0.01) and speci ﬁcity ( ρ
of 0.43, pvalue of 0.02 and Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient ( r)o f
0.34; Fig. 5A). Conversely, we only observed signi ﬁcant correlations
between PhysChem LDA predictions and antibody speci ﬁcity ( ρof
0.45, pvalue of 0.01 and rof 0.49; Fig. 5B). Notably, the neural
network models for UniRep and PhysChem features each onlyachieved statistical signi ﬁcance for one antibody property (Sup-
plementary Fig. 11). Likewise, the OneHot LDA models, which
only account for the absence of residues at previously mutated
CDR sites, also only achieved statistical signi ﬁcance for one anti-
body property ( pvalue of 0.01 for af ﬁnity and 0.27 for speci ﬁcity).
Finally, if we did not limit our predicted mutations to those with
relatively high conservation (Blosum62 substitution scores ≥0) for
our best models (LDA UniRep), statistically signi ﬁcant predictions
were only observed for one of the antibody properties ( pvalue of
0.03 for speci ﬁcity and pvalue of 0.41 for antigen binding). Overall,
these ﬁndings demonstrate that LDA models trained with deep
learning features were superior at generalizing to novel mutational
space relative to those trained with conventional physicochemical
antibody features, which is consistent with the ﬁndings from the
leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Fig. 10). More generally,
these ﬁndings demonstrate the great potential for using these
approaches to predict antibody mutations at novel CDR sites that
co-optimize multiple properties linked to therapeutic antibody
performance.
We next plotted the experimental measurements of the relative
antibody af ﬁnity and non-speci ﬁc binding against each other for
the 70 IgGs produced in this study, including the 29 IgGs with
novel mutations absent in the original library, to identify the
variants with the most co-optimal combinations of af ﬁnity and
speciﬁcity (Fig. 6A). One variant (EM2) displayed particularly
attractive properties, as it displayed increased antigen binding
(1.28x) and reduced non-speci ﬁc binding (0.30x) relative to wild
type. Therefore, we evaluated this variant and its ﬁrst-generation
parental variant (EM1) in more detail. Af ﬁnity analysis of IgG
binding as a function of antigen concentration revealed that both
EM1 (EC 50of 2.6 ± 0.2 nM) and EM2 (EC 50of 2.4 ± 0.3 nM) have
higher af ﬁnity than wild type (EC 50of 4.4 ± 0.8 nM; Fig. 6B).
Despite the increased af ﬁnity of these variants, they both showed
reduced non-speci ﬁc binding to a second polyspeci ﬁcity reagent
(soluble membrane proteins) relative to wild type (Fig. 6C), which
is consistent with similar non-speci ﬁc binding measurements
obtained using ovalbumin (Fig. 6A). Moreover, both EM1 and
EM2 are at least as active at inhibiting hepatocyte growth factor-
induced proliferation of human cancer cells as the wild-type
antibody (Fig. 6D). EM1 and EM2 also have attractive, drug-like
biophysical properties, as they display low levels of self-
association (CS-SINS scores <0.35) in a standard antibody
formulation (pH 6 and 10 mM histidine), which suggests the
antibody mutants will display low viscosity and opalescence in
concentrated antibody formulations (150 mg/mL; Fig. 6E)47.
Moreover, these antibody variants display high thermal stability
with melting temperatures >75 °C (Fig. 6F)15. Collectively, these
results demonstrate the great potential of using machine learning
for co-optimizing therapeutic antibodies to improve both af ﬁnity
and speci ﬁcity while maintaining high bioactivity and other drug-
like biophysical properties.
Finally, we sought to understand the molecular basis for the
improved antibody af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity of the best emibetuzu-
mab variant (EM2; Fig. 7). This variant contained ﬁve CDR
mutations relative to wild type, including one in HCDR2 and four
in HCDR3 (Fig. 7A). Given the importance of both HCDRs on
antibody af ﬁnity, we assumed that these mutations may be located
at CDR sites that are outside of the paratope. However, we found
that two of the ﬁve mutations occurred within the predicted
paratope and there was some rearrangement within this region
(Fig. 7B), which may be linked to the increased af ﬁnity of EM2
(Fig. 6B)48. The novel HCDR3 mutation in EM2 (D101E), which
increases both af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity, is a conservative mutation
located just outside the predicted paratope. Additional CDR
mutations located outside the predicted antibody paratope, such as
R54G in HCDR2, led to the removal of a large positively chargedNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31457-3 ARTICLE

the strong link between positively charged patches in antibody
CDRs and non-speci ﬁc binding24,49–52. Overall, these ﬁndings
suggest the combination of CDR mutations in EM2 that co-
optimize af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity do so by largely preserving the
paratope for high af ﬁnity binding while disrupting a positively
charged patch outside the paratope to reduce non-speci ﬁc binding.
Discussion
We have developed a facile approach for the multi-objective
optimization of therapeutic antibodies. We show that one-
dimensional projections obtained from LDA models re ﬂect the
continuous variability of the evaluated biophysical properties.
These projections, linear combinations of learned scalings that
maximize interclass separation, are trained on binary datasets for
afﬁnity and speci ﬁcity, yet are correlated with continuous prop-
erty values, which enables the direct identi ﬁcation of Pareto
optimal antibodies. Examination of the projection weights for
OneHot features revealed that LDA scalings were strongly cor-
related with the site-speci ﬁc enrichment of mutations in antibody
libraries screened for high levels of antigen and non-speci ﬁc
binding (Supplementary Fig. 12). While we are unaware ofprevious work on predicting continuous metrics correlated with
antibody properties such as af ﬁnity or non-speci ﬁc binding from
binary deep sequencing datasets, it is notable that this general
approach has been pursued in unrelated ﬁelds of study. For
example, in the ﬁeld of text analysis, it has been demonstrated
that continuum information can be predicted based on binarylabels
53. This approach used the outputs of a variety of trained
binary classi ﬁers to predict continuous sentiment scores asso-
ciated with text samples. We believe that this general approach
holds great potential for improving and simplifying antibody
engineering.
Another aspect of our work that deserves further consideration
is the demonstration of strict tradeoffs between antibody af ﬁnity
and speci ﬁcity at the library scale (thousands of mutants). Pre-
vious studies have elucidated similar tradeoffs for pairs of anti-
body and protein properties, including af ﬁnity/thermostability,
afﬁnity/solubility and humanness/thermostability16,21,54–60.
However, these studies are generally limited by low-throughput
measurements of relatively small sets of protein mutants (tens to
hundreds of individually produced and experimentally measured
variants)16,21,54. In contrast, our approach applies to much larger
numbers of antibody mutants, the size of which is only limited by
the deep sequencing technology. Moreover, previous studies thatAntigen bindingρ = 0.13

such as humanness (e.g., human string content)55and stability
(e.g., AMBER energy calculations)56are either not applicable for
predicting other antibody properties given the lack of models
(e.g., non-speci ﬁc binding) or the dif ﬁculty in applying them due
to the need for extremely accurate antibody/antigen structures
(e.g., af ﬁnity). In contrast, our methods enable the simple iden-
tiﬁcation of Pareto optimal clones directly from binary deep
sequencing data without the need for pre-existing models,
including those that require accurate antibody/antigen structural
information. Our approach also enables the selection of speci ﬁc
levels of multiple antibody properties at the same time, affording
greater control over the antibody engineering process than has
been possible previously.
Another key aspect of our work is the ability to identify
beneﬁcial mutations that were absent in the original antibody
library, enabling extrapolation to novel mutational space. A
common goal of machine learning in the ﬁeld of protein
engineering is to develop generalizable algorithms that can
extrapolate to unseen mutations , especially at non-mutated
sites in the training sets. A recent study demonstrates the great
potential of algorithms that use deep learning features togeneralize to novel mutational space for improving the activity
of enzymes and ﬂuorescent proteins36.
Our models, which used similar types of deep learning features
and generalize to novel mutational space, deserve further con-
sideration. First, we found that it was necessary to limit the
predictions to mutations with moderate-to-high evolutionary
conservation (Blosum62 substitution scores ≥0). This was
necessary because the models also predicted mutations with lower
evolutionary conservation, such as tryptophan mutations in the
CDRs, which we found resulted in levels of af ﬁnity and non-
speciﬁc binding that were poorly correlated with the model pre-
dictions. We expect that additional information about the site-
speciﬁc frequencies of mutations in antibody repertoires, which
were not considered in this work, could be incorporated into
future models to further improve predictions. Second, the deep
learning features used in this work were generated from algo-
rithms trained on millions of diverse proteins, including mostly
non-antibody proteins35,36. We expect that similar deep learning
features extracted from more closely related protein sequences,
such as human antibody repertoires, will lead to even better
model performance. Third, we used simple comprehensive scans
of single mutations to predict novel sequences. This approach willAntigen bindingIn-library

However, the neural networks used here could serve as a starting
point to implement generative neural networks that could enable
the prediction of antibody sequences with de ﬁned af ﬁnities and
speciﬁcities61,62. Fourth, the models in this work were trained to
generalize to novel mutational space for predicting metrics cor-
related with two antibody properties (af ﬁnity and speci ﬁcity) that
could be readily screened in a high-throughput manner using
massive antibody libraries. We expect that our approaches could
be easily extended to other antibody properties that can be
screened via in vitro library sorting. For example, our approachcould be used for simplifying the selection of species cross-
reactive antibodies. The lack of species cross-reactivity is a
common problem in pre-clinical development because antibodies
that bind their target human antigens with high af ﬁnity often
weakly bind or fail to bind antigen orthologs from different
species (e.g., mouse, rat and monkey) that are necessary for pre-
clinical testing
63,64. A key next step is to rigorously test the
generality of our approaches for predicting the impacts of addi-
tional sets of CDR mutations in emibetuzumab as well as CDR
mutations in other antibodies with unique physicochemical
properties. We believe that these and other exciting opportunities
are expected to lead to machine learning models that can
increasingly generalize to novel mutational space and reduce the
amount of required experimentation to obtain co-optimized
drug-like antibodies.

Abstract
MotivationUnderstanding antibody–antigen interactions is key to improving their binding affinities and specificities. While experimental approaches are fundamental for developing new therapeutics, computational methods can provide quick assessment of binding landscapes, guiding experimental design. Despite this, little effort has been devoted to accurately predicting the binding affinity between antibodies and antigens and to develop tailored docking scoring functions for this type of interaction. Here, we developed CSM-AB, a machine learning method capable of predicting antibody–antigen binding affinity by modelling interaction interfaces as graph-based signatures.ResultsCSM-AB outperformed alternative methods achieving a Pearson's correlation of up to 0.64 on blind tests. We also show CSM-AB can accurately rank near-native poses, working effectively as a docking scoring function. We believe CSM-AB will be an invaluable tool to assist in the development of new immunotherapies.Availability and implementationCSM-AB is freely available as a user-friendly web interface and API at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/csm_ab/datasets.Supplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 Introduction
Antibodies are powerful research and clinical tools, due to their ability to achieve high binding affinity and specificity to antigens. The interactions between antibodies and their targets are mediated by highly variable loops, the complementary determining regions, which have distinctive amino acid propensities considerably enriched in aromatic residues and Asp (Koide et al., 2007), allowing antibodies to form better shape complementarity to diverse epitopes using less close contacts compared with globular protein recognitions. This allows for a small fraction of variable loops to contribute to the majority of antibody–antigen binding energy (Robin et al., 2014), indicating that finding unique features across antibody–antigen binding interfaces should be key to improve the binding affinity and specificity of antibodies.Structural insights have proven important for guiding antibody design and engineering, but are often limited by availability of experimental structures. Significant efforts have, therefore, been focussed on improving molecular docking approaches (Agrawal et al., 2019); however, their success rate on identification of native poses of antibody–antigen complexes was lower than for enzyme–inhibitor complexes (Yan and Huang, 2019). Most scoring functions also showed only weak correlations to the experimentally determined binding affinities (KD) of antibody–antigen complexes (Guest et al., 2021), highlighting the need for more accurate scoring functions and affinity predictors for antibody design.Graph-based signatures are a simple way of describing the geometry and physicochemical properties of biological molecules, which allows complex networks of amino acids in antibody–antigen interfaces to be efficiently modelled. We have previously shown that they are a powerful tool for predicting the binding affinity of small molecules to proteins (Pires and Ascher, 2016), and understanding the effects of mutations on antibody binding (Myung et al., 2020a,b; Pires and Ascher, 2016). Here, we have developed CSM-AB, the first dedicated scoring function for antibody–antigen docking and binding affinity predictor by adapting our concept of graph-based signatures in order to capture not only close-contact features but also surrounding structural information relevant for antibody–antigen binding. We show that this is an accurate and scalable way of not only scoring docking poses, but to also predict the antibody binding affinity. We validate CSM-AB using independent blind tests and show it outperforms alternative methods. Details on data collection, feature engineering, model training and evaluation can be found in Supplementary Materials. 2 Results
CSM-AB achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient of up to 0.40 (RMSE = 1.71 kcal/mol, Supplementary Fig. S1) when attempting to predict antibody–antigen binding affinity on 472 complexes under cross-validation, performance that was consistent for different validation strategies (5-, 10-, 20- and leave-one-out cross validation), demonstrating that there were no significant sampling biases during training. When we compared the performance of our approach with other 18 existing methods, CSM-AB significantly outperformed all of them (P-value < 0.001) when predicting antibody–antigen binding affinity (as the Gibbs Free Energy of binding, ΔG, in kcal/mol) (Supplementary Table S1).As experimental structures might not always be available, the performance on theoretical models of structures can be important in antibody–antigen docking platforms. To assess the scoring capability of CSM-AB on mutated antibody–antigen complexes, we collected single-point and multiple-point mutants (up to 14 mutations per structure) from mCSM-AB2 (Myung et al., 2020b) and mmCSM-AB (Myung et al., 2020a) datasets, respectively, which were used as blind tests. CSM-AB achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.61 (RMSE = 1.68 kcal/mol) and 0.64 (RMSE = 1.75 kcal/mol) on 689 single-point and 301 multiple-point mutations (Supplementary Fig. S2). A significant number of the least accurate predictions (18) were in tight-binders (ΔG = −12 to −14 kcal/mol, for the PDB 3L5X) or (6) of constructs with many point mutations introduced (6 to 14 mutations per case for the PDB 3BDY), which accounted for more than 70% of outliers (Supplementary Fig. S3). Compared with other methods, CSM-AB showed superior performance on both single-point and multiple-point mutants (Supplementary Table S1), significantly outperforming (P-value < 0.001) all 18 methods used in the comparison.We further investigated the ability of CSM-AB in ranking docked poses on the Dockground (Kundrotas et al., 2018) and ZDOCK benchmark v4 (Hwang et al., 2010) datasets. The predicted ΔG of each complex was ranked and counted if the near-native model was ranked first. CSM-AB showed comparable performance to 18 available tools in scoring docked poses showing six Top1 ranked models (counts of near-native models) out of 15 antibody–antigen complexes (Supplementary Table S1). Also, we measured the performance of available docking methods on local perturbation poses using the ZDOCK dataset which were filtered by CαRMSD and DockQ-CAPRI quality (Basu and Wallner, 2016). Using Kendall's rank correlation coefficient between the predicted ΔG and DockQ-score, CSM-AB ranked Top1 out of 19 methods (Supplementary Table S2) achieving the average Kendall's tau of 0.43. Notably, obtaining correctly docked structures from unbound antibody and antigen chains has been more challenging than of using its bound form due to the possible structural changes upon binding. The 19 tools showed limited performance on the seven antibody–antigen complexes (avg. Kendall’s tau of 0.16) from their unbound forms than the six structures (avg. Kendall’s tau of 0.21) from their original antibody–antigen complexes. CSM-AB also showed better performance on the seven bound complexes (avg. Kendall’s tau of 0.43) than those of the six antibody–antigen complexes (avg. Kendall’s tau of 0.157).The CSM-AB web-server provides two prediction modes. The single mode predicts the binding affinity of antibody–antigen complexes (ΔG) and allows users to inspect the distribution of interactions found in the antibody–antigen interfaces via bar chart and 3D visualization (Fig.  1). The docking scoring mode allows re-scoring of docked structures. All docked structures should be provided in a single-receptor PDB file and a multiple-pose (up to 100 poses) PDB file. Users can browse the result of each pose in docking scoring mode with the interactive datatable with 3D visualization (Fig.  1). CSM-AB has also been made available as an Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate incorporation in Bioinformatics pipelines.
Fig. 1.Open in new tabDownload slideThe workflow of this study is described in four steps (top). In data collection and curation, binding affinity datasets (472 training data, 689 single-point mutations and 301 multiple-point mutations) and docking poses (15 Dockground and 13 ZDOCK antibody–antigen complexes) were collected and curated for evaluation of binding affinity and scoring poses. At the feature engineering step, graph-based signatures, Arpeggio interactions, free solvent accessible surface area, residue depth, secondary structure information were extracted and evaluated on collected datasets. During machine learning, all the extracted features were used for cross-validation and greedy feature selection with supervised machine learning algorithms. The performance of CSM-AB and available methods on single-point and multiple-point mutations were compared (middle). On the last step, the best performing model across both binding affinity and scoring docked poses was implemented into CSM-AB webserver. Users can predict ΔG and atomic interactions of an antibody–antigen complex via ‘affinity prediction’ mode and re-score up to 100 docked poses via ‘scoring poses’ mode (bottom) 3 Conclusions
Antibody–antigen docking approaches have been widely needed for accelerating lead characterization and optimization processes of immunotherapy development. While significant effort has been devoted to improve the performance of docking scoring functions, currently available methods show limited accuracy in predicting the binding affinity of antibody–antigen complexes.CSM-AB is a machine learning approach, taking account of structural features such as graph-based signature and atomic interactions across the antibody–antigen interface residues. Compared to other approaches, CSM-AB presented better performance on cross-validation and blind test, sets demonstrating its capability of binding affinity prediction and applicability in re-scoring docked antibody–antigen complexes. CSM-AB is available as a user-friendly web-server and API at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/csm_ab/. Funding

Abstract
Intravenously delivered antibodies have been previously found to distribute in a perivascular
fashion in a variety of tumor types and despite targeting a range of different antigens. Properties of
both the antibody and the targeted antigen, such as the administered dose, binding affinity, and
antigen metabolic half-life, are predicted to influence the observed perivascular distribution. Here,
the effect of antibody dose on the perivascular distribution is determined using an unbiased image
analysis approach to quantify the microscopic distribution of the antibody around thousands of
blood vessels per tumor. This method allows the quantitative determination of the localization of
blood vessels, extravasated antibody, and tumor antigen following the administration of antibody
doses covering two orders of magnitude in the dose range commonly utilized in preclinical
studies. A mathematical model of antibody extravasation, diffusion, binding, and endocytosis in a
Krogh cylinder geometry with parameters directly measured or taken from the literature is
quantitatively consistent with the experimentally determined profiles. A previously reported
scaling analysis is employed to extend these results to any tumor model in which the antigen
density and turnover rate are known, allowing facile quantitative prediction of the minimum
antibody dose required for complete tumor saturation.

INTRODUCTION
Antibodies represent a significant and rapidly growing proportion of oncology therapeutics.1
Although many have found success in a range of cancers, particularly hematologic
malignancies, there remain substantial barriers to the effective use of antibodies to treat solid
tumors. Solid tumors present a number of barriers to tumor targeting and penetration,
including blood clearance, extravasation, diffusion through the interstitial space, binding to

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptantigen, endocytosis, and degradation.2,3 Many of these barriers are further exacerbated by
the disordered physiology of solid tumors, which results in highly permeable and irregular
vasculature and high interstitial fluid pressure.4–6 For decades researchers have noted that
the penetration into solid tumor tissue is often limited for drugs ranging in size and
mechanism of action from chemotherapeutics to antibodies and nanoparticles.3,4,7–11
Limited penetration has been linked to reduced therapeutic efficacy, even in cases in which
bulk tumor uptake is high enough to exert an antitumor effect with a well-distributed
therapeutic.12 Recently it was shown that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved
monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and trastuzumab penetrate poorly into tumors in animal
xenograft models.13,14
Quantitative in vitro  studies of antibody delivery to and distribution within tumor spheroids
have yielded insights into the roles that antibody affinity and antigen internalization play in
this process.15,16 In vivo , for a range of antibodies, antigens, and cell lines, extravasation
from tumor blood vessels has been shown to display a characteristic perivascular
distribution in which the tumor cells within a few cell layers of the perfused vessels are
often saturated with antibody, but more distal regions show little to no evidence of
therapeutic targeting.7,8,12–14 Common bulk measures of tumor uptake such as percent
injected dose per gram fail to differentiate the heterogeneity of tumor targeting at the
microscopic scale.
Here, we present an in vivo  study of monoclonal antibody and antigen distribution around
tumor blood vessels as a function of antibody dose covering two orders of magnitude. A
computer-aided method of analyzing entire tumor cross sections in a quantitative and
unbiased manner is utilized to generate data. These results are consistent with a Krogh
cylinder model and scaling analysis, which predict the antibody dose necessary to saturate a
tumor for a given antigen cell surface expression level and metabolic half-life. Although
these modeling analyses are dramatic oversimplifications of the tumor microenvironment,
they are nonetheless successful in quantitatively predicting the distribution of extravasated
antibody averaged over the tumor cross section.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
A low-picomolar humanized antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), designated
sm3e, has previously been engineered and characterized.17 This antibody was secreted in
transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California),
purified by protein A resin (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) and buffer exchanged into
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The antibody was fluorescently labeled using the Alexa
Fluor 488 protein labeling kit from Invitrogen. Labeling was conducted in a single batch of
approximately 3 mg protein to yield a homogenously labeled reagent source for all
experiments presented. Anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M85151a was purchased from
Fitzgerald (Acton, Massachusetts), and goat anti-rat 546 secondary antibody was from
Invitrogen. Antibody M85151a was labeled with the Alexa Fluor 647 protein labeling kit
(Invitrogen) and has been previously determined to be noncompetitive with sm3e.18
Animal Model
Animal use and care was conducted in full compliance and under approval from the
Committee on Animal Care of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A CEA-positive
human colorectal cancer cell line, LS174T, was used to induce xenograft formation in the
flanks of 6–8 weeks old NCr nude mice (Taconic, Hudson, New York) by subcutaneous
injection of 5 × 106 cancer cells. Tumors were allowed to establish and grow to a size of 5–Rhoden and Wittrup Page 2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript10 mm, at which point antibody injections were conducted. Varying doses of fluorescently
labeled sm3e, ranging from 5 to 500 µg, were supplemented as needed with immunoglobulin
(Ig) G from human serum (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) to 500 µg total IgG and then
injected retroorbitally into tumor-bearing nude mice. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after
antibody administration and tumors were immediately excised and snap frozen in optimal
cutting temperature medium (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, California) via isopentane
over liquid nitrogen. Frozen blocks were stored at −80°C until sectioned by the Histology
Core Facility of Koch Institute. Frozen blocks were sectioned approximately 1–2 mm into
the tumor tissue at a thickness of 8 µm and stored at −80°C until stained and imaged.
Immunofluorescence Protocol
Frozen slides were first air dried for approximately 30 min and then the tissue samples were
circled with a PAP pen (Invitrogen). Tissues were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in
formalin and then washed three times with PBS. Blocking was performed with 5% goat
serum (Invitrogen) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was 5%
goat serum in PBS + 1:100 rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, California)
overnight at 4°C. Slides were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with PBS +
0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma–Aldrich) + 1:200 goat anti-rat 546 (Invitrogen) + 1:100
M85151a-647 anti-CEA antibody (Fitzgerald) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were
washed four times with PBS and then mounted in Vectashield + 4’,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, California).
Fluorescence Imaging
Slides were imaged using a DeltaVision Spectris microscope (Applied Precision, Issaquah,
Washington) equipped with a motorized stage and running Softworx software (Applied
Precision). Emission and excitation filters were arranged to permit simultaneous four-color
imaging of DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546, and Alexa Fluor 647. The paneling
feature of Softworx (Applied Precision) was used to capture the entire tumor section at a
resolution of 1.336 µm/pixel and to stitch together the fields into a single large mosaic image
for subsequent analysis.
Modeling
Antibody extravasation was modeled using an extension of a previously described Krogh
cylinder model of the tumor vasculature, as detailed in the Supplementary Material.19
Criteria for tumor saturation were estimated using the Thiele modulus concept described
previously and using parameters extracted from the literature or measured directly in tumor
sections. The key assumption underlying the Thiele modulus is that the extent of antibody
distribution through the tumor volume is determined by the balance between endocytic
consumption of bound antibody and extravasation/diffusion. The Thiele modulus represents
the dimensionless ratio of these competing rates and is described mathematically as
When ϕ2 = 1, these characteristic rates are equal and hence saturation is approximately
achieved. ke is the endocytic rate constant for antibody/antigen complexes. R is the average

RESULTS
Unbiased Image Analysis
Rather than introduce potential observer bias by manually selecting individual blood vessels
for analysis, images were analyzed as entire tumor sections for features including intervessel
distance, antibody penetration from blood vessels, and antigen distribution. The 546-nm
(blood vessel) plane was isolated, thresholded to include vessels only, and converted to a
binary image using ImageJ [National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland]. A
Euclidean distance map was created from the vessel binary, and this map was used as a
mask to measure the average intensity in the antibody (488) and antigen (647) planes as a
function of distance from the nearest blood vessel by an automated MATLAB (Mathworks,
Natick, Massachusetts) computer program (Fig. 1). Regions of the tumor revealed to be
necrotic or stromal tissue by examination of hematoxylin and eosin staining or by the
absence of antigen were excluded from the analysis.
Microdistribution Experimental Results
An anti-CEA IgG was dosed at levels ranging from 5 to 500 µg in mice with xenografted
LS174T tumors. Mosaic images of full tumor cross sections that have been intensity scaled
identically are shown in Figure 2. Corresponding imaging of antigen expression in these
tumor sections confirms CEA expression throughout (Supplementary Data).
At low antibody doses, ranging from 5 to 50 µg, considerable perivascular binding and
localization of extravasated antibody is observed, with a general trend of increasing
penetration distance and perivascular antibody intensity with increased antibody dose (Figs.
2a–2c). In contrast, higher doses of 150 and 500 µg show near-complete penetration of the
tumor, with no clear perivascular distribution of the antibody. When tumor sections are
analyzed by computer to quantitatively determine the microdistribution trends, doses of 5
and 15 µg are seen to display perivascular distribution, which then decreases to near-
background levels approximately 40–50 µm from the blood vessels on average. In contrast,
the 50 µg dose also shows enhanced localization adjacent to blood vessels with decreasing
signals with distance from vessels, beginning approximately 20 µm from the vessel, but this
dose retains some degree of specific signal and never drops to background levels. The
highest two-dose levels, which appear to saturate the tumor tissue, show no perivascular
localization. Essentially, all tumor tissue is reached, with marginal additional binding
detectable between the 150 and 500 µg doses.
Microdistribution Mathematical Modeling
To predict how antibody penetration will depend on parameters such as antigen density,
endocytic half-life, and antibody affinity, a previously described Krogh cylinder-based
model was extended (Supplementary Data).19 Parameter values were determined from the
literature where appropriate and from direct measurement in the case of the Krogh cylinder
radius (Supplementary Data). This model includes the effects of blood clearance,
extravasation, antibody diffusion through the interstitial space, binding, unbinding, and
endocytic clearance. Simulations of single-vessel extravasated antibody profiles over the
experimental dose range show excellent agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 3).
These experimental results represent the averages of the antibody microdistribution from
thousands of blood vessels per tumor section analyzed. The model reproduces theRhoden and Wittrup Page 4

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptperivascular distribution seen at low doses as well as the complete penetration, which occurs
at the highest doses, and the intermediate condition observed at the 50 µg dose level.
Thiele Modulus Analysis
For the LS174T tumor and the CEA-targeting sm3e antibody used in this study, tumor
saturation appears to occur at a dose between 50 and 150 µg. However, the dose required to
saturate a tumor will be dependent on several antibody- and antigen-dependent factors,
including antigen density and turnover rate as well as antibody affinity, permeability,
diffusivity, and clearance rate. For the case of IgGs, previous analyses have strongly
suggested that the factors limiting tumor penetration are not blood clearance related, but
instead related to binding and endocytosis of antibody–antigen complexes.2 A dimensionless
number termed the Thiele modulus ( ϕ2) can be used to quantitatively describe the ratio of
the rate of binding and endocytosis of an antibody to its rate of extravasation and diffusion
into the tumor. This rate of extravasation and diffusion must be greater than the rate of
binding and endocytosis (i.e., ϕ2 < 1) for the antibody to fully penetrate a given distance.
Applying this dimensionless analysis using parameters obtained from the literature or
directly measured from the experimental data (Supplementary Data) allows the
determination of the saturation criteria for a tumor as a function of antigen density and
turnover rate, parameters easily found in the literature or measured for a tumor model of
interest (Fig. 4). Antibody affinity also can play a significant role, as very-high-affinity
antibodies bind essentially irreversibly to tumor antigen and are eventually endocytosed and
degraded. Moderate-affinity antibodies require lower doses for tumor penetration, as they
are able to dissociate from bound antigen and diffuse farther into tumor tissue before being
endocytosed and degraded (Fig. 4b).
DISCUSSION
We present here an unbiased image analysis of the microdistribution of antibody and antigen
in xenograft tumors. The use of appropriately selected fluorophores allows independent
imaging of extravasated antibodies, blood vessels, and antigen in entire xenograft tumor
cross sections. The full cross-section, devoid of any nontumor or necrotic areas, can then be
analyzed by the use of the MATLAB program (Mathworks), which measures and averages
the pixel intensities in the antibody and antigen channels for each of the blood vessels in a
tumor section. These data represent a snapshot of the average extravasated antibody
distribution from all the vessels in an entire tumor section.
Using this image analysis method, we determined that for the particular antigen and
antibody pair used here, complete tumor penetration occurs at a dose between 50 and 150
µg. Quantitatively, perivascular distribution is clearly observed in low doses (5 and 15 µg),
less prominent at 50 µg, and absent at doses that fully penetrate the tumor. Interestingly, the
normalized antibody–antigen intensity changes relatively little between the highest dose
levels, suggesting that antigen saturation may have occurred and that increasing antibody
dose beyond this level has little potential beneficial effect on targeting tumor cells.
A Krogh cylinder model of antibody distribution around a blood vessel was employed to
predict these results. This model uses the parameters of the antibody and antigen that have
been culled from the recent literature, or measured from the experimental results in the case
of the Krogh cylinder radius. This parameter was estimated directly from intervessel
distribution data measured in the tumor sections imaged (Supplementary Data). Using no-fit
parameters, the model shows excellent agreement with the data. Despite the simplifications
inherited in the use of the Krogh cylinder model, the model is able to quantitatively predict
the antibody distribution profiles across the dose ranges examined. Low doses indicate an
exclusively perivascular distribution, moderate (50 µg) doses show enhanced binding nearRhoden and Wittrup Page 5
J Pharm Sci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 01.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptblood vessels but retain binding much further from the vessel, and high doses show uniform
antigen saturation. The model predicts that the highest doses saturate all antigen binding
sites; additional antibody accumulation at these high doses is due to the unbound antibody,
which has extravasated into the tumor and is free to diffuse or bind free antigen. The
experimental images may not capture this unbound antibody, as during the tumor excision,
embedding, sectioning, and immunofluorescent staining processes there are abundant
potential opportunities to wash away the free antibody.
These concepts can be generalized to different antibody– antigen combinations through the
use of the Thiele modulus dimensionless quantity. This number, a ratio of the rate of binding
and catabolism to the rate of extravasation and diffusion, succinctly captures the limiting
rate processes for long serum half-life therapeutics like antibodies. It should be noted that
molecules with substantially shorter half lives may also be limited by their rapid blood
clearance, although this is not the case for IgGs.2 Setting the Thiele modulus equal to unity,
at which point the rates are equal, allows the determination of the minimum criteria for full
penetration of a tumor. These criteria will depend upon the easily measured quantities of
antigen density and endocytosis rate, as well as the antibody properties. Typical antibody
properties are used for the plots in Figure 4 and are listed in Table 1. The rate of antigen
turnover can be seen to have a very strong effect on tumor penetration, suggesting that
antigens that are endocytosed as a part of constitutive membrane turnover may be good
targets with respect to beneficial intratumoral distribution.
Antibody affinity may also play a significant role in tumor penetration; the criteria for
penetration of a 10-pM binder are markedly different from those of a 1-nM binder. This
phenomenon occurs as a consequence of the different time scales of unbinding for high
versus moderate-affinity binders. High-affinity binders rarely dissociate over the lifespan of
a bound antigen, whereas moderate-affinity binders are more likely to bind multiple
antigens, diffusing between each one. This may allow moderate-affinity binders to penetrate
farther into the tumor than very-high-affinity binders, albeit at the cost of fewer antibodies
per targeted cell.
Quantitative analysis and modeling of perivascular antibody distribution can be a useful
window into elucidating the factors that ultimately determine whether a given therapeutic is
able to fully penetrate the tumor tissue. Experiments using a well-characterized antibody–
antigen model system in vivo  provide validation for the mathematical framework and show
that tumor penetration should be possible at antibody doses near the high end of those
commonly used in preclinical studies. However, penetration is much easier to achieve for
slowly internalizing antigens such as those turned over constitutively with the cell
membrane. Actively endocytosed antigens require much larger doses for complete
penetration; this is an important consideration for antibody–drug conjugates, which are
typically targeted to rapidly internalized antigens. The pharmacodynamic benefits of
efficient antibody–drug conjugate internalization are obtained at micropharmacokinetic cost
of impeded tumor penetration.

Abstract
Introduction— In pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT), a bifunctional antibody is
administered and allowed to pre-localize to tumor cells. Subsequently, a chelated radionuclide is
administered and captured by cell-bound antibody while unbound hapten clears rapidly from the
body. We aim to engineer high-affinity binders to DOTA chelates for use in PRIT applications.
Methods— We mathematically modeled antibody and hapten pharmacokinetics to analyze hapten
tumor retention as a function of hapten binding affinity. Motivated by model predictions, we used
directed evolution and yeast surface display to affinity mature the 2D12.5 antibody to 1,4,7,10-
tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), reformatted as a single chain variable
fragment (scFv).
Results— Modeling predicts that for high antigen density and saturating bsAb dose, a hapten
binding affinity of 100 picomolar (pM) is needed for near-maximal hapten retention. We affinity
matured 2D12.5 with an initial binding constant of about 10 nanomolar (nM) to DOTA-yttrium
chelates. Affinity maturation resulted in a 1000-fold affinity improvement to biotinylated DOTA-
yttrium, yielding an 8.2 ± 1.9 picomolar binder. The high-affinity scFv binds DOTA complexes of

INTRODUCTION
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) uses radionuclides directly conjugated to antibodies to target
tumor-specific antigens, aiming to deliver high doses of radiation to neoplasms while mostly
sparing healthy tissues. RIT has shown clinical efficacy in non-Hodgkins lymphoma and
other blood cancers. However, RIT has not been successful in the treatment of solid cancer,
where the antibody must traverse the tumor vasculature before encountering its target cells.
Due to the low permeability coefficient of antibodies across the capillary wall, large
concentrations are needed in order to achieve sufficient tumor penetration. At the same time,
systemic exposure of healthy tissues to radiation resulting from slow plasma clearance limits
the dose that can be safely administered.
PRIT decouples the pharmacokinetics of antibody targeting and radionuclide delivery, and
has been shown to increase efficacy and decrease toxicity in both preclinical and clinical
models [1-5]. In PRIT, a bifunctional antibody is administered first and allowed to bind to
cancer antigen. Because it is not directly attached to a radioactive metal, high doses can be
administered. After sufficient tumor uptake of the antibody, a chelated radionuclide is
administered and is captured by the pretargeted antibody while the unbound hapten is
cleared rapidly from the body.
The first PRIT reagents used the high-affinity binding of streptavidin to biotin for
radionuclide capture. However, this approach has significant disadvantages. Streptavidin is a
bacterial protein and is consequently immunogenic in humans. In addition, streptavidin
localizes to the kidneys, where it appears to remain accessible to bind biotinylated hapten
resulting in renal toxicity [6]. Endogenous biotin and the biotinylated hapten compete for
streptavidin binding sites [7]. Finally, endogenous biotinidase can cleave biotin from the
hapten molecule, requiring the use of biotinidase-resistant linkers [8].
Second generation PRIT approaches employ bispecific antibodies (bsAb) with specificity
for both cancer antigen and chelated radionuclide [2]. An approach with a bispecific
antibody recognizing an indium EDTA derivative has been studied previously [9]. Because
antibodies to metal chelates generally exhibit relatively weak binding, researchers have
taken advantage of avidity and developed bivalent haptens to improve tumor retention of the
radiometal chelate [2, 10-13]. Another approach to improve hapten tumor retention uses anOrcutt et al. Page 2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptengineered redox-reactive group in the radiometal chelate to attach covalently to a free thiol
in the antibody [14]. However, it remains a challenge to maintain the free thiol during
antibody production, purification and delivery.
We present here an alternative approach using DOTA as the radionuclide-carrying hapten.
DOTA-metal-complexes are essentially irreversible under physiological conditions and
demonstrate higher thermodynamic stability than linear DTPA and EDTA complexes for
many metals including gadolinium, yttrium, and lutetium [15-17]. DOTA-gadolinium
(DOTA-Gd) has extensive clinical history as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast
agent and has an excellent safety profile in humans [18]. DOTA-Gd diffuses rapidly, and
exhibits rapid renal clearance. A monoclonal DOTA-binding antibody, 2D12.5, was
previously isolated from an immunized mouse [3, 19]. 2D12.5 binds to DOTA chelates of
all lanthanides with similar nanomolar affinity [3, 20] and to DOTA chelated to indium and
copper with weaker affinity [14]. This promiscuity in binding is an unusual property, as
other anti-metal-chelate antibodies generally bind only one or two chelated metals with
significant affinity [21, 22].
The goal of the present study was to develop a high-affinity antibody to DOTA chelates,
starting from the 2D12.5 antibody. A high-affinity DOTA binder will enable the use of
simple DOTA as the pretargeting hapten.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Modeling
The PRIT models developed here are straightforward extensions of two model systems
developed and described by Thurber and colleagues [23]. The micrometastasis model uses
spherical geometry and assumes diffusion-only transport. The vascularized tumor model
uses cylindrical geometry around capillaries. Numerical simulations were performed in
MATLAB (The MathWorks, Framingham, MA). Details of the mathematical models are
provided in the supplemental materials.
PRIT simulations were performed for a 1 g vascularized tumor and a 400 μm diameter
micrometastasis assuming a 70 kg human with 3.5 L of blood volume. An IgG-like
bispecific antibody is given as a bolus dose of 7 μmol at time zero. The hapten is given as a
bolus dose of 350 nmol with 5 GBq initial activity at 72 h. The model implements a
clearing/blocking step 24 h before hapten dosing, in which 99.9% of bsAb hapten binding
sites are blocked in the blood compartment. After hapten dosing, unbound hapten
concentration in the blood is calculated as the initial hapten concentration minus hapten
binding sites in the blood from unblocked residual antibody. The model assumes a 90Y
radionuclide that has a residualization half life of 120 h after cellular internalization.

procedure of Takenouchi et al. [25] starting with the compound H-Lys(Boc)-OMe (Bachem,
E-1620). H-Lys(Boc)-OMe was treated stepwise with methyl bromoacetate and
diethylenetriamine to obtain tert-butyl 4-(3,12-dioxo-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-2-

followed by trifluoroacetic acid Boc deprotection to obtain 4-(1,4,7,10-

(biotin-xx, SSE) purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) in DMSO with a 10 fold molar
excess of triethylamine for 3 h vortexing at room temperature to form DOTA-alkyl-biotin
(Figure 2). In all synthesis steps compounds were purified by HPLC and their identity and
purity confirmed by mass spectrometry with a Waters (Milford, MA) LCT electrospray
time-of-flight (ES-TOF) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) or by MALDI-
TOF as described above.
Metal complexes of each DOTA derivative (see Figure 2 for chemical structures) were
prepared as follows. Yttrium nitrate hexahydrate, lutetium (III) chloride hexahydrate, indium
(III) chloride, gallium (III) nitrate hydrate, and gadolinium (III) chloride hexahydrate were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and prepared as stock solutions in 0.4 M sodium
acetate pH 5.2. To a 2 mM (for DOTA and DOTA-Bn) or 400 μM (for DOTA-Bn-biotin)
solution of the chelating agent, a 5-fold molar excess of the metal stock solution was added
and chelated by overnight rotation at room temperature. The pH was adjusted to 7 with 10 M
NaOH and the complex was diluted with phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (PBSA) to a final concentration of 1 mM (for DOTA and DOTA-Bn) or 200 μM
(for DOTA-Bn-biotin). For gadolinium chelates, an identical metal loading procedure was
used except that the complexation reaction took place at 80°C for 12 h in a thermocycler.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptKinetic Characterization
KD Measurements for DOTA-Bn-biotin-metal— Equilibrium dissociation constants
(KD) for binding of yeast surface-displayed scFv to biotinylated DOTA complexes at 37°C
were determined in triplicate by titration as described by Chao et al. [27]. Briefly, yeast
expressing an scFv clone on their surface were grown, washed with PBSA and incubated
with various concentrations of DOTA-Bn-biotin-metal long enough to allow for at least a
95% approach to equilibrium. Bound DOTA-Bn-biotin-metal was detected by fluorescence
activated cell sorting (FACS) after incubation with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Generally, 5 × 105 induced cells were used for each concentration point.
When antigen concentrations less than 10 pM were assayed, the titration was performed
with 2.5 × 104 induced and 7.5 × 105 non-induced cells to ensure antigen excess over the
scFv without requiring impractically large volumes. The addition of non-induced cells aids
pelleting during centrifugation [28]. When antigen concentrations greater than 100 nM were
used, non-specific antigen binding to the yeast surface was taken into account. Yeast
expressing an irrelevant scFv on their surface were treated in the same manner as the yeast
displaying the scFv of interest, and mean total phycoerythrein fluorescence (MFU tot) due to
non-specific binding was measured by flow cytometry and averaged over three replicates.
This value was subtracted from the MFU tot for the yeast of interest, and the data was fit by
least-squares regression.
KD Measurements for DOTA-metal and DOTA-Bn-metal— To determine the K D for
scFv binding to nonbiotinylated haptens, the above protocol was modified to a competition-
based assay as follows. After determining the K D for scFv binding to DOTA-Bn-biotin-Y, a
titration was set up with 100 pM DOTA-Bn-biotin-Y, 2.5 × 105 cells per tube, and varying
concentrations of the nonbiotinylated complex. Incubation, staining, and flow cytometry
analysis was the same as that for biotinylated antigen. MFU tot as a function of the
concentration of the nonbiotinylated antigen ([Ag]), normalization constant (MFU range),
minimal total mean fluorescence (MFU min), K D for DOTA-Bn-biotin-Y (KD,biot), DOTA-
Bn-biotin-Y concentration ([Ag biot]), and K D for the antigen of interest (K D) follows this
modified equation:
The data was fit by least squares regression as before, varying MFU min, MFU range and K D.
Dissociation Kinetics— To determine the dissociation rate, k off, for DOTA-Bn-biotin
complexes, cells were induced and washed as above, and 1 × 107 cells were incubated in 1
mL PBSA with 1 nM DOTABn-biotin-metal for 1 h to reach saturation. Subsequently, the
yeast were washed with 1 mL PBSA, resuspended in 1 mL PBSA with 1 μM (excess) non-
biotinylated antigen as competitor and split into 100 uL aliquots. These aliquots were
incubated at 37°C for different lengths of time, then washed with cold PBSA and left on ice.
All samples were simultaneously stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrein for 10-20 minOrcutt et al. Page 5

regression, varying MFU min, MFU range and k off:
For nonbiotinylated antigens, the procedure was identical except that initial saturation was
with the nonbiotinylated antigen and DOTA-Bn-biotin-metal was used as competitor. The
data followed the expression
Affinity maturation
The 2D12.5 scFv served as our starting point and was subjected to nine rounds of directed
evolution by random mutagenesis and subsequent selection for improved binding using
yeast surface display as described by Chao and colleagues [27] and adapted as follows.
Mutagenesis— To counteract the mutational bias of error-prone PCR, mutagenesis at each
round was also performed with the Mutazyme mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the resulting mutagenized DNA was
pooled with that obtained by error-prone PCR. All other steps were carried out as described
[27].
Selection— Each round of mutagenesis resulted in a library size of 0.5–4 ×107 and was
sorted 2-3 times by flow cytometry for improved binders. At least five times the estimated
library diversity was labeled for cell sorting. Staining was performed by equilibrium
incubation at a biotinylated DOTA-Y concentration of approximately 1/3 of the average K D
of the previous library (in early rounds) or by saturation with antigen followed by
dissociation for 2-3 dissociation half-times (in later rounds), and subsequent labeling with
streptavidin-phycoerythrein (Invitrogen). To label for full-length scFv expression, the yeast
were also stained with a mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science, Basel,
Switzerland) or a mouse anti-cmyc (clone 9e10, Covance, Princeton, NJ) primary antibody
and a goat anti-mouse Alexa-647 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody. Yeast expressing the best
0.01–0.1% of binders were collected. Periodically, the antigen was alternated between
DOTA-Bn-biotin-Y and DOTA-alkyl-biotin-Y.
Disulfide stabilization and glycosylation knockout— The N-linked glycosylation
site in the heavy chain of the scFv was removed and a disulfide bond between the heavy and
light chain was introduced during the seventh mutagenesis of the affinity maturation. This
was accomplished by introducing through PCR site-directed mutagenesis the mutations

plasmid DNA was isolated using a Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The plasmid DNA
was sequenced and transformed back into yeast with the EZ yeast transformation kit (Zymo
Research). Clonal yeast cultures were grown and their kinetic parameters determined.
Bispecific Antibody Construction
An IgG-like bispecific antibody that binds to CEA and DOTA was engineered from a high-
affinity Sm3e antibody [29] and the C8.2.5 scFv as described [30]. An analogous bispecific
antibody with the wild-type 2D12.5ds scFv was also constructed by ligating the 2D12.5ds
scFv into the light chain plasmid between the Nhe1 and Sal1 restriction sites. The bispecific
antibodies were produced in transient HEK293 culture and purified by protein A
chromatography as described [30].
Radiolabeling
The HPLC/mass spectrometry platform used for purification of radioactive small molecules
has been described in detail [31, 32]. DOTA-Bn was dissolved at 5 mM in ammonium
acetate pH 5.5. 1-2 mCi 111InCl 3 (Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH) were added to the metal
chelate and incubated for 1 h at 90°C. The radiolabled compound was purified by RP-HPLC
with gamma detection on a 4.6 × 75 mm Symmetry C18 column using a linear gradient from
0% to 100% B over 15 minutes, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, where A = water and B =
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
Animal Model
All animal handling was performed in accordance with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center Animal Research Committee guidelines. LS174T human colorectal carcinoma cells
(CL 188) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained under
standard conditions and confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma and mouse pathogens by
the Yale Virology Lab. Xenografts were established in 5-6 week-old male NCRU-nu/nu
mice (Taconic Farms) by subcutaneous injection of 1-2 × 106 LS174T cells into the flank of
the mouse. After 8-10 days, tumors were 0.1 – 0.5 g in size. 30 ug of bispecific antibody was
injected intravenously followed 24 h later by intravenous injection of 1.3 pmol 111In-labeled
DOTA-Bn. Mice were euthanized 24 h later by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, a
method consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American
Veterinary Medical Association. Tumors were resected, washed in PBS, weighed, and
counted with a model 1470 Wallac Wizard (Perken Elmer, Wellesley, MA) 10-detector
gamma counter. A Students t-test was used to examine the differences between the
experimental groups.
RESULTS
Mathematical Modeling
We mathematically modeled the effect of DOTA-binding affinity on the delivery of ionizing
radiation in pretargeted radioimmunotherapy. Two mathematical models were implemented
that simulate PRIT based on previously validated models, one that simulates antibodyOrcutt et al. Page 7
Nucl Med Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 May 26.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptdistribution in vascularized tumors and the other in micrometastases [23]. These two types
of tumors were considered separately due to different modes of transport. For
micrometastases, antibody and hapten diffuses into the tumor mass from the surrounding
interstitial fluid. While there may be some transport from surrounding interstitial fluid into
the edges of large vascularized tumors, the majority of antibody and hapten transport occurs
across the tumor vasculature.
We extended both models to account for hapten kinetics, assuming an IgG-like bsAb with an
affinity of 100 pM to CEA [30], and a 15 h internalization half-life [33]. We used a bsAb
blood concentration of 2 μM as an input variable. We expect this initial concentration to
essentially saturate the antigen binding sites for vascularized tumors from both modeling
predictions and from Fenwick and colleagues [34] demonstrating that antibody doses of
several hundreds of micrograms or more are required to obtain saturation in a mouse
xenograft model. PRIT model timing and dosing parameters are similar to that of a recent
Phase II human trial [35] with bsAb dosing at time 0, followed by a clearing/blocking step at
48 h and hapten dosing at 72 h, with an initial hapten blood concentration of 100 nM. Our
model predicts that this hapten dose will saturate the pretargeted bsAb binding sites in the
vascularized tumor. Note that bsAb and hapten doses are orders of magnitude above those
predicted to saturate micrometastases. The model assumes a 70 kg man and 2-compartment
pharmacokinetic parameters for antibody and hapten. A detailed description of all model
parameters is provided in the supplemental materials.
PRIT model simulations were run, varying the hapten dissociation rate while keeping the
association rate constant. We simulated hapten concentration in the tumor as a function of
time and total cumulative activity assuming a 90Y radionuclide over a time interval of 15
days. Hapten retention in vascular tumors (Figure 1A) and micrometastases (Figure 1B)
were predicted over a hapten K D range of six orders of magnitude. The half-time of
residualization of DOTA chelates after internalization is assumed to be 120 h (estimated
from [36]). We looked at the effect of varying the association rate while maintaining a
constant K D and found no significant difference in hapten retention for typical hapten
association rates (5×105 – 5×107 M−1s−1), demonstrating that the relevant parameter is K D.
For the aforementioned PRIT conditions, we predict that a hapten K D greater than 100 pM
will allow significant hapten retention for both vascularized tumors and micrometastases.
The affinity of the bsAb to the tumor antigen has a negligible impact on hapten retention for
bsAb/antigen affinites of ~10 nM or better (data not shown). This is due to lower capillary
permeability of large proteins such that they are able to re-bind repeatedly and remain in the
tumor even at modest affinities [37].
Affinity maturation
We affinity matured the 2D12.5 antibody fragment against biotinylated DOTA-Y by
directed evolution. We used biotinylated DOTA-Y in order to probe binding using a
streptavidin-fluorophore secondary label and flow cytometry, as DOTA-Y itself possesses
no intrinsic fluorescent properties. The gene encoding the variable domains of the 2D12.5
DOTA-binding antibody in an scFv format (Figure 3C) was synthesized from its published
sequence [38]. The scFv was subsequently subjected to nine rounds of affinity maturation.Orcutt et al. Page 8
Nucl Med Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 May 26.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptYeast expressing 2D12.5 scFv variants were labeled for expression with either DOTA-Bn-
biotin-Y or DOTA-alkyl-biotin-Y (Figure 2) followed by streptavidin-phycoerythrein and
sorted by flow cytometry to select the highest affinity clones. The antigen was periodically
switched to minimize selection of variants with mutations that conferred binding
improvement to the linker region. During the seventh mutagenesis, we introduced an
intramolecular disulfide bond between the heavy and light variable regions of the scFv [39]
and removed the N-linked glycosylation site in the heavy chain. These additional mutations
may improve stability and result in simpler downstream processing of the scFv.
Sequences and kinetic constants were determined for several clones from libraries 8.2 (8
rounds of mutagenesis followed by 2 sorts) and 9.3 (9 rounds of mutagenesis and 3 sorts).
All clones from library 9.3 had lost the disulfide bond between the heavy and light chain and
were consequently discarded. Of the clones from library 8.2, C8.2.5 retained the disulfide
bond and bound most tightly to DOTA-Bn-biotin-Y.
Improved mutant C8.2.5
The sequence (Figure 3C) of the high-affinity C8.2.5 scFv differs from 2D12.5ds (the
original 2D12.5 scFv with the addition of the intramolecular disulfide bond and removed
glycosylation site) at 15 amino acid positions. The spatial distribution in the crystal structure
of wild-type 2D12.5 is depicted in Figure 3A and 3B. Only one mutation, N53(L)H
(numbering corresponds to the 2D12.5 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) for which the crystal
structure was determined [38]), occurred within 5 Angstroms of the bound hapten,
indicating that most mutations enhanced affinity via subtle structural perturbations remote
from the binding interface.
Kinetic characterization
The kinetic properties of both 2D12.5ds and C8.2.5 were characterized and are summarized
in Tables 1 and 2 and in Figures 4 and 5. The affinity of the scFv to DOTA-Bnbiotin-Y was
improved by 3 orders of magnitude, from nanomolar to single-digit picomolar. The
dissociation half-time for DOTA-Bn-biotin-Y increased from 5.5 min for 2D12.5ds to just
over 5 hours for C8.2.5 (Table 2 and Figure 5).
The high-affinity clone C8.2.5 binds DOTA-Bn-biotin-Y, DOTA-Bn-Y, and DOTA-Y with
equilibrium dissociation constants of 8.2 ± 1.9 pM, 15.4 ± 2.0 pM, and 103 ± 35 pM,
respectively. The addition of the benzene ring and biotin moiety may change the charge
distribution of the DOTA epitope, altering the affinity. It is also possible that there are some
binding interactions between the scFv and the benzene ring and biotin linker region. The
affinity differences between these various yttrium chelates are reflected in their dissociation
half-lives (Table 2 and Figure 5).
DOTA complexes of lutetium and gadolinium were bound by C8.2.5 similarly to those of
yttrium (Table 1 and Figure 4). The high-affinity scFv also binds indium and gallium
chelates with nanomolar affinity. All DOTA-metal chelates were bound by C8.2.5 with
about an order of magnitude weaker affinity than the respective DOTA-Bn metal chelate.Orcutt et al. Page 9
Nucl Med Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 May 26.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptComplete metal complexation of DOTA was confirmed using LC/MS as described in the
materials and methods. However, LC/MS may not be able to distinguish the
thermodynamically stable complex from intermediates that may form [40]. To confirm that
the kinetic characterization described above was not influenced by the presence of
intermediate complexes, the DOTA-Bn metal complexes were incubated for an additional
12 h at 80°C; the measured binding affinities of these DOTA-Bn complexes to C8.2.5 were
essentially the same as those described above (data not shown).
Analysis of tumor targeting in vivo
The C8.2.5 scFv was engineered into an IgG-like bispecific antibody as a C-terminal fusion
to the light chain of a CEA-targeting Sm3e IgG [30]. The bispecific antibody retains
parental affinities of both the C8.2.5 scFv and Sm3e IgG, with an affinity of ~100 pM to
CEA-expressing LS174T cells, and also exhibits IgG-like blood clearance and tumor
targeting in vivo  [30]. Mice injected with 30 ug C8.2.5 bispecific antibody 24 hours prior
to 111In-DOTA-Bn administration exhibit significantly greater tumor uptake of the hapten
24 hours later, compared to an analogous bispecific antibody containing the wild-type
2D12.5ds scFv and 111In-DOTA-Bn only (Figure 6), demonstrating improved retention of
the 111In-DOTA-Bn at the site of the tumor for the affinity matured scFv.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have used a mathematical model of PRIT to predict the maximum
achievable cumulative activity in the tumor as a function of antibody binding affinity to the
radiometal chelate. While other mathematical models of PRIT have been developed [41, 42],
for the present work we exclusively used published measured parameters without any curve
fitting. Hapten retention at the site of the tumor depends on a large number of factors,
including the hapten dissociation rate, rebinding of dissociated hapten, diffusion rate,
capillary permeability, hapten pharmacokinetics in the blood, and antigen internalization.
For therapeutic applications, it is desired that the hapten is retained at the site of the tumor
until the majority of radioactive decays have occurred.
From predicted hapten tumor concentrations, we have calculated tumor cumulative activities
for a 90Y radionuclide. It would be straightforward to further calculate doses to the tumor
assuming spherical geometry and published S-values for 90Y [43]. However, we have not
presented dose estimates, as we expect the model to provide qualitative trends but due to
significant heterogeneity in many of the model parameters, we do not expect accurate
predictions of true clinical doses.
Motivated by mathematical modeling, we used directed evolution and yeast surface display
to affinity mature the 2D12.5 scFv to biotinylated DOTA-Y with a goal of low picomolar
affinity. The resulting high-affinity clone not only binds DOTA-Y chelates but also lutetium
and gadolinium chelates with low picomolar affinity and indium and gallium chelates with
nanomolar affinity. While the 2D12.5 Fab binds the DOTA chelates of all lanthanides with
similar nanomolar affinity and indium DOTA chelates with micromolar affinity [44], it was
not a priori obvious that this versatility would persist throughout the affinity maturation. The
engineered high-affinity clone possesses mutations that significantly improve binding toOrcutt et al. Page 10
Nucl Med Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 May 26.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptseveral metal chelates, despite selective pressure only toward the yttrium chelate. This
promiscuous binding is highly advantageous in further preclinical and clinical development
of a bispecific agent containing the C8.2.5 scFv for pretargeting, as it allows metals (with
their different radioactive properties) to be varied and used with the same bsAb.
Interestingly, the metals whose complexes are bound by C8.2.5 most tightly – yttrium,
lutetium, and gadolinium – are chelated by DOTA with identical coordination chemistry,
having a coordination number of 9 with one crystalline water molecule in the complex
[45-47]. Indium and gallium, in contrast, are chelated by DOTA with coordination numbers
of 8 and 6, respectively [48, 49]. This leads us to hypothesize that C8.2.5 may bind all
lanthanides with low-picomolar affinities, as they are known to form nonacoordinate
chelates with DOTA that bind with similar nanomolar affinities to wild-type 2D12.5 [20] .
This suggests further potential biotechnological applications for C8.2.5, exploiting for
example the luminescence of Tb and Eu.
The nature of the accumulated mutations in C8.2.5 is similar to that previously observed for
engineering extremely high-affinity binders from a moderate binder to the same antigen
[50]. Most mutations occurred away from the binding interface, many of them at second-
shell residues, and are conservative with respect to physicochemical properties. This
indicates that enhanced binding stems from slight structural adjustments, rather than novel
direct binding contacts to the hapten. Determining a crystal structure for C8.2.5 bound to
DOTA-Y would enable a more detailed analysis of the binding interactions.
Based on our model, we predict that our high-affinity scFv will effect approximately 4-fold
higher cumulative activities in vascularized tumors and 8-fold higher cumulative activities in
micrometastases when compared to the wild type 2D12.5 antibody (for 90Y radionuclides)
for the model conditions. We also predict that any further improvement in affinity to yttrium
chelates would result in no more than a two-fold increase in cumulative activity in
micrometastases and would have no significant effect in vascularized tumors. Four-fold and
eight-fold improvements in cumulative activity may seem modest for an affinity
improvement of three orders of magnitude. However, these predictions are based on the
selection of a highly expressing cancer antigen and saturating bsAb and hapten doses
(similar to optimized doses tested previously in pretargeted radioimmunotherapy studies in
the clinic [35]). While sub-saturating bsAb doses, lower antigen densities, and smaller
hapten doses would result in more striking cumulative activity increases for hapten affinity
improvements, they would also result in significantly lower tumor cumulative activities
overall.
We investigated the effect of the in vitro  affinity maturation of 2D12.5 in vivo  in a xenograft
mouse model, where we compare bispecific antibodies constructed with the high-affinity
C8.2.5 scFv and the wild-type 2D12.5 scFv (Figure 6). The comparative tumor uptake data
show that the affinity maturation resulted in a significant improvement in hapten retention in
vivo in this model. These results encourage the design of more elaborate in vivo  studies in
mice including optimization of the injected dose of bsAb and blockage of the circulating
bsAb with a clearing agent. Detailed studies with optimized dosing will be presented
elsewhere. While we have utilized a bispecific antibody that is a C-terminal scFv fusion toOrcutt et al. Page 11
Nucl Med Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 May 26.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptthe light chain of an IgG, other bispecific constructs could be constructed with the C8.2.5
scFv such as diabodies [51], scFv-IgGs, di-diabodies, and scDb-Fc fusions (reviewed in
[52]).
While IgG-like bispecific antibodies are expected to result in significantly higher tumor
accumulation than smaller antibody fragments due to slower blood clearance [53, 54], a
considerable amount of antibody will likely remain in the blood at the time of hapten dosing.
Thus a clearing/blocking step may be necessary to minimize hapten binding to residual bsAb
in the blood. This may be achieved with a DOTA conjugated dextran or albumin blocking
agent, a cold dose of DOTA chelate, a galactosylated DOTA-dextran or DOTA-albumin
clearing agent, or a combination thereof. While three-step pretargeted radioimmunotherapy
is more complex than proposed two-step approaches [12, 55], it may result in higher tumor
doses for a given amount of bispecific antibody (due to a higher concentration of hapten
binding sites accumulating in the tumor) and possible antibody dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cycotoxicity (CDC) due to the retained Fc
domain.
Based on the model results, hapten retention is expected to be similar for DOTA-Bn-Y with
a 10 pM affinity and DOTA-Y with a 100 pM affinity under antigen saturation for highly
expressed tumor targets. This is a hypothesis that will be tested in vivo . Either DOTA or
DOTABn could be used with this system; we have recently shown that 111In-DOTA-Bn
clears rapidly from the blood, and is not retained significantly in any organ (K.D. Orcutt et
al., manuscript in press).
We have engineered a versatile, DOTA-chelate-binding scFv with picomolar binding to
yttrium, lutetium, and gadolinium chelates and nanomolar binding to indium and gallium
chelates. Our approach comprised mathematical modeling of the pharmacokinetics of the
bsAb and the metal chelate for the treatment of both micrometastatic disease and
vascularized tumors to derive design specifications, and protein engineering via directed
evolution using yeast surface display to achieve the desired outcome experimentally. We
anticipate that the high-affinity DOTA-binding C8.2.5 scFv will prove useful for pretargeted
imaging with positron emission tomography using 86Y and single photon emission
computed tomography using 111In and pretargeted therapy with beta-emitters 177Lu and 90Y.
C8.2.5 may also be useful for targeted MRI with multivalent macromolecular contrast
agents containing DOTA-Gd.

Research proposal: The goal of this study is to engineer a high-affinity antibody to DOTA chelates for use in pretargeted radioimmunotherapy and imaging. The research will involve affinity maturation of the 2D12.5 antibody fragment using directed evolution and yeast surface display to improve its binding to DOTA chelates. The engineered high-affinity antibody will be evaluated for its potential use in developing pretargeted imaging and therapy protocols to exploit the potential of a variety of radiometals. The study will include in vitro characterization of the binding affinity and specificity of the engineered antibody to DOTA chelates, as well as in vivo evaluation of its tumor retention in a xenograft mouse model."

Key Points
The family of Fc receptors for IgG (FcγRs) is broadly expressed by cells of haematopoietic origin and consists of one inhibitory and several activating receptors that differ in their affinity and specificity for immunoglobulin subclasses.
On innate immune effector cells, activating and inhibitory FcγRs set a threshold for cell activation by immune complexes. Important examples for effector responses that are regulated by FcγRs are phagocytosis, ADCC and the release of inflammatory mediators.
On dendritic cells (DCs), paired FcγR expression regulates cell maturation and antigen presentation, thereby indirectly controlling the cellular immune response.
On B cells, the inhibitory FcγRIIB is essential for the maintenance of humoral tolerance. It acts as a late checkpoint at the level of class-switched memory B cells, plasmablasts or plasma cells. In addition, FcγRIIB has an important role in regulating plasma-cell homeostasis and survival.
The antibody–FcγR interaction is influenced by several factors that have an impact on the expression level of activating and inhibitory FcγRs (such as cytokines) or change the affinity of the antibody–FcγR interaction (such as differential antibody glycosylation).
Depending on the specific glycosylation pattern, IgG molecules can have enhanced pro- or anti-inflammatory activities. Importantly, antibody glycosylation is regulated during immune responses.
Targeting the factors that influence the antibody–FcγR interaction might open new avenues for immunotherapeutic interventions in autoimmune and malignant diseases.
AbstractIn addition to their role in binding antigen, antibodies can regulate immune responses through interacting with Fc receptors (FcRs). In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that regulate the activity of IgG antibodies in vivo. In this Review, we discuss recent studies addressing the multifaceted roles of FcRs for IgG (FcγRs) in the immune system and how this knowledge could be translated into novel therapeutic strategies to treat human autoimmune, infectious or malignant diseases.

GlossaryRegulatory T cells
A T cell subset that is capable of suppressing the activity of other antigen-specific T cells including autoreactive T cells. Depletion of regulatory T cells results in the loss of peripheral tolerance and the development of autoimmune disease.
Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif
(ITAM). A short peptide motif containing tyrosine residues that is found in the cytoplasmic tail of several signalling adaptor proteins such as the common γ- or CD3ζ-chain. It is necessary to recruit proteins that are involved in triggering activating signalling proteins. The consensus sequence is Tyr-X-X-(Leu/Ile)-X6–8-Tyr-X-X-(Leu/Ile), where X denotes any amino acid.
Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif
(ITIM). A short peptide motif containing a tyrosine residue that is found in the cytoplasmic portion of FcγRIIB and other regulatory proteins such as CD22 or CD72 that is necessary to recruit negative regulatory signalling proteins. The consensus sequence is (Ile/Val/Leu/Ser)-X-Tyr-X-X-(Leu/Val), where X denotes any amino acid.
Type I transmembrane glycoproteins
Glycoproteins of which the carboxyterminus of the polypeptide chain is located in the cytosol whereas the aminoterminus is exposed to the extracelluar space.
Neonatal FcR
(FcRn). FcRn is unrelated to classical FcRs and binds to a different region in the antibody Fc fragment. Structurally it is related to the family of MHC class I molecules and is responsible for regulating IgG half-life.
Dyad symmetry
The symmetrical arrangement of the repetitive structural elements an antibody molecule is composed of.
Complement cascade
There are three independent pathways that can lead to the activation of the complement cascade. The classical pathway is activated via C1q binding to immune complexes, the alternative pathway is triggered by direct C3 activation, and the lectin pathway is initiated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binding to the surface of microorganisms.
K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model
A mouse strain formed by crossing non-obese diabetic (NOD)/Lt mice with KRN T-cell-receptor-transgenic mice on the C57BL/6 background. As the KRN receptor on the T cells recognizes a peptide from the autoantigen glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, these mice develop an arthritis that is mediated, and transferable, by circulating antibody against glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.
Class switching
If B cells recognize their cognate antigen in the spleen a portion of them switch the expression of their B-cell receptor from IgM to other isotypes such as IgG, IgA or IgE. The decision of which isotype is generated is strongly influenced by the specific cytokine milieu and other cells such as T-helper cells.
Pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain
An amino acid motif that enables proteins to recognize phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.
Plasmablasts
A short lived, dividing cell population that can develop from any type of activated B cell and that is characterized by its capacity to secrete antibodies.
Plasma cells
Terminally differentiated quiescent B cells that develop from plasmablasts and are characterized by their capacity to secrete large amounts of antibodies.
Affinity maturation
A process in which random mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B-cell receptor genes followed by selection of cells with a higher affinity for the cognate antigen. This process takes place in specialized compartments of the spleen, which are known as germinal centres.
Competitive dislocation
This term refers to the competition of newly developed plasma cells for anatomical niches in the bone marrow that are already occupied by plasma cells that were generated during previous immune responses.
Cross presentation
The uptake of proteins by dendritic cells results in their degradation into small peptides in endosomal and lysosomal compartments and peptide presentation on MHC class II molecules. Cross presentation describes a process in which endocytosed material escapes into the cytoplasm where it is degraded by the proteasome followed by presentation on MHC class I molecules.

ABSTRACT  
Despite recent progress in understanding the cancer genome, there is still a relative delay in 
understanding the full aspects of the glycome and glycoproteome of  cancer. Glycobiology has been 
instrumental in relevant discoveries in various biological and medical fields, and has contributed to 
the deciphering of several human diseases. Glycans are involved in fundamental molecular and cell 
biology processes occurri ng in cancer, such as cell signalling and communication, tumour cell 
dissociation and invasion, cell –matrix interactions, tumour angiogenesis, immune modulation and 
metastasis formation. The roles of glycans in cancer have been highlighted by the fact that  
alterations in glycosylation regulate the development and progression of cancer, serving as 
important biomarkers and providing a set of specific targets for therapeutic intervention. This 
Review discusses the role of glycans in fundamental mechanisms cont rolling cancer development 
and progression, and their applications in oncology.  
INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, glycobiology has gained increased importance in cancer research, given its role in 
understanding various cancer mechanisms and as it provides a s et of targets for diagnostic 
application and therapeutic strategies1 –6. Glycosylation can act as a key regulatory mechanism 
controlling several physiopathological processes. Defects in glycosylation in humans and their links 
to disease have shown that the mammalian glycome contains a remarkable amount of biological 
information7. Glycan diversity arises from differences in monosaccharide composition (for example,

A01/00  galactose (Gal) or N ‑acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)), in link ‑ age between monosaccharides (for 
example, between carbons  1 and  3 or carbons  1 and  4), in anomeric state, in branching structures, in 
other substitutions (such as sulfation state) and in linkage to their aglycone part (protein or lipid)8,9  
(FIG.  1). Characterizing the biological functions of each glycan10, as well as those of glycan ‑binding 
proteins (including galectins and sialic acid -binding immunoglobulin -type lectins (siglecs)), has been 
shown to make important contributions to the canc er field1 –3,5. Different types of glyco ‑ 
conjugates interfere with key cancer cell processes as well as with the tumour microenvironment, 
leading to cancer progression. This Review describes how glycans affect and regulate the genesis 
and progression of ca ncer. The recent cutting ‑edge technological developments in glycobiology 
and their innovative applications in the oncology field are also introduced and discussed.  
Glycoconjugates and glycosylation  
Glycosylation is defined as the enzymatic process that pro duces glycosidic linkages of saccharides 
to other saccharides, proteins or lipids1,11. Glycoconjugates are primarily defined according to the 
nature of and linkage to their aglycone (non ‑glycosyl) part (FIG.  1). Glycoproteins carry one or 
more glycans cova lently attached to a polypeptide backbone, usually via nitro ‑ gen or oxygen 
linkages, in which case they are known as N -glycans or O -glycans, respectively8,12,13 (FIG.  2). A 
common type of protein O ‑glycosylation is ini ‑ tiated via GalNAc — the first monos accharide that 
connects serine or threonine in particular forms of protein O ‑glycosylation (O ‑GalNAc) called 
mucin‑ type O -glycosylation12,13 — which can be extended into various different structures14. 
There are other types of O -glycans as well, such as t hose attached via O -mannose, and the 
nucleocytoplasmic glycan O ‑linked β‑N‑acetylglucosamine (O -GlcNAc)15 (FIGS  1,2). In addition, 
other forms of glycosylation exist that occur only in specific types of proteins, such as the Notch 
receptor, and these have been shown to be impor ‑ tant in cancer cell biology16 (BOX  1). Moreover, 
several proteins are linked to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 
anchor; these are known as GPI ‑anchored proteins8 (BOX  2). Other major classes of 
glycoco njugates include the proteoglycans and glycosphingolipids (FIG.  1). Proteoglycans are 
glycoconjugates that have one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) , such as chondroitin sulfate,  
heparan sulfate and keratan  sulfate8. Hyaluronan is a GAG primarily found as a  free sugar  chain. 
Glycosphingolipids are molecules composed of a glycan linked to a lipid ceramide. The structural 
and functional classifications of glycosphingolipids have traditionally been based on their glycan 
part8. The first sugars linked to ceramid e in higher animals are typi ‑ cally β‑linked galactose 
(galactosylceramide) or glucose (glucosylceramide). In vertebrate glycosphingolipids, the glucose 
moiety is typically substituted with β‑linked galactose, creating a lactosylceramide 
(d‑galactosyl ‑1,4‑β‑d‑ glucosylceramide). Glycosphingolipids include a series of neutral ‘core ’ 
structures and gangliosides, which typically carry one or several sialic acids and have been shown to 
regulate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling17.  
Glycosylation alterati ons in cancer  
Changes in glycosylation associated with oncogenic transformation were first described over more 
than six decades ago18,19. Those observations were further corroborated with the advent of 
monoclonal antibody technology, which showed that tumour‑specific antibodies were directed 
against carbohydrate epitopes and, in most cases, were oncofetal antigens present on tumour

A01/00   glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids20,21. Tumour cells display a wide range of glycosyla ‑ tion 
alterations compared with  their non ‑transformed counterparts. Protein glycosylation increases 
molecular hetero geneity as well as the functional diversity within cell populations (FIG.  2). This 
heterogeneity occurs because aberrant glycan modifications are protein ‑ specific, site ‑specific 
(different sites on a given protein can be differentially glycosylated) and cell ‑specific. The 
specificities of glycosylation depend on various intrinsic factors of the glycosylation process within a 
given cell or tissue type. Two principal mechan isms underlying the tumour ‑associated alterations 
of carbo‑ hydrate structures were first postulated by Hakomori and Kannagi, in the so ‑called 
incomplete synthesis and neo ‑synthesis processes22. The incomplete syn ‑ thesis process, 
occurring more often in early stages of cancer, is a consequence of the impairment of the nor ‑ mal 
synthesis of compl ex glycans expressed in normal epithelial cells, which leads to the biosynthesis of 
trun‑ cated structures, as seen with s ialyl Tn (STn) expression in gastrointestinal and breast 
cancers23,24. Conversely, neo ‑synthesis, commonly observed in advanced stages of cancer, refers 
to the cancer ‑associated induction of certain genes involved in the expression of carbohydrate 
determin ants, as seen in the de  novo expression of cer ‑ tain antigens (such as sialyl Lewis  a (SLea) 
and SLex) in many cancers25. In general, a shift from the normal glycosylation pathway occurs in 
cancer cells, leading to altered glycans expression owing to one o r various factors. First, altered 
expression of glycans can be attributed to under ‑ or overexpression of glycosyltransferases (owing 
to dys‑ regulation at the transcriptional level25 –28, dysregulation of chaperone function29,30 
and/or altered glycosidase a ctivity31). Second, altered glycan expression can be due to changes in 
the tertiary conformation of the peptide backbone and that of the nascent glycan chain. Third, the 
differences can stem from the variability of vari ‑ ous acceptor substrates as well as the availability 
and abundance of the sugar nucleotide donors and cofac ‑ tors32. Finally, changes in glycan 
expression can be due to the expression and localization of the re levant glycosyltransferases in the 
Golgi apparatus33,34. Mislocalization and/or ch anges in the activity of the glycosyltransferases 
results in the synthesis of imma ‑ ture core glycan structures35,36. Studies have shown that early 
acting enzymes synthesizing core O ‑glycans, such as GalNAc transferases, core  1 GalNAc  β1,3‑ga 
lactosyltrans ferase  1 (C1GalT1) and core  2 β1,6‑N‑ acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT), are 
enriched in cis - and medial ‑Golgi cisternae34,37, whereas late ‑ acting enzymes (such as 
sialyltransferases) are enriched in trans -Golgi cisternae. In cells, overexpression of α‑GalNAc 
α‑2,6‑sialyltransferase  I (ST6GalNAc ‑I; encoded by ST6GALNAC1), the enzyme responsible for 
STn biosynthesis23,24,38, leads to expression of enzymes in all Golgi cisternae and disrupts 
glycosylation by pre ‑ maturely adding sialic acid to form the S Tn antigen36,38. The most ‑widely 
occurring cancer ‑associated changes in glycosylation are sialylation, fucosylation, O ‑glycan 
truncation, and N - and O‑linked glycan branching2,39,40 (FIGS  2,3).  
Sialylation.  Sialylation is an important modification in cellular glycosylation, as sialylated 
carbohydrates have an important role in cellular recognition, cell adhesion and cell signalling. An 
increase in global sialylation — especially in α2,6 ‑ and α2,3‑linked sial ylation — owing to altered 
glycosyltransferases expression has been closely associated with cancer41. The lactosaminic chains 
are frequently terminated with a sialic acid. For example, α2,6‑sialylated lactosa ‑ mine 
(Sia6LacNAc) is the product of β ‑galactos ide α2,6‑sialyltransferase  I (ST6Gal ‑I)42, an enzyme 
with altered expression in various malignancies — includ‑ ing colon, stomach and ovarian cancer42 
— and that has been reported to be a predictive marker of poor progno ‑ sis in colon cancer43. 
Other major  sialylated antigens associated with cancer are SLea and SLex (REF.  2) (FIG.  2). SLea 
and SLex have been demonstrated to be highly expressed in many malignant cancers, and SLex 
expression levels have been correlated with poor survival in cancer patients44, 45. SLex is the

A01/00  well‑known ligand for selectins46, which are vascular cell adhesion molecules that belong to a 
family of C ‑type lectins (which require calcium for binding). During inflammation, selectins 
mediate the initial attach ‑ ment of leukocytes to th e endothelium during the process of leukocyte 
extravasation46. In cancer, SLex interactions with selectins regulate the metastatic cascade by 
forming emboli of cancer cells and platelets and favouring their arrest on endothelia (FIG.  4), 
therefore determin ing the malignant behaviour and development of metastasis47. Tumour 
metastasis has been shown to be attenuated in animal models by the use of specific GAGs, such as 
heparin, that inhibit P ‑selectin‑mediated interactions of platelets with carcinoma cell ‑surface 
ligands48. The SLea tetrasaccharide, which is detected by the serological assay CA19 ‑9, is a 
cancer‑associated marker widely used in the clinical practice. The CA19 ‑9 assay has been mostly 
applied in patients with an established diagnosis of pancreati c, colorectal, gastric or biliary can ‑ cer 
and used to monitor clinical response to therapy3,49. In addition, elevated preoperative 
concentrations of CA19 ‑9 have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in colon and 
gastric carcinoma50. Increased si alylation in cancer also includes the expression of polysialic acid, 
which is associated with several types of cancers and is frequently expressed in high ‑grade 
tumours51,52. Polysialic acid can often be pre ‑ sent in neural cell adhesion molecule  1 (NCAM1) , 
and this is associated with aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome in cancers, including lung 
cancer, neuroblastoma and gliomas51,52. Gangliosides are also overexpressed in tumours such as 
melanoma, neuroblastoma and breast cancer, in which they mediat e cell proliferation, tumour 
growth and cancer cell migration17,53.  
Box 1 | The unique type of Notch glycosylation  
Notch signalling is essential for cell fate, and dysregulation of the pathway leads to various human 
diseases, including cancer96. Glycosyla tion of the Notch extracellular domain has been shown to 
regulate Notch activity96. The Notch ligands (the Delta, Serrate and LAG -2 family of proteins) bind 
to the extracellular domain of Notch receptor, triggering its activation by inducing a conformation al 
change that exposes cleavage sites in Notch. Cleavage at these sites results in liberation of the 
Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and controls the transcriptional 
activation of the transcription factor recombining binding p rotein suppressor of hairless (RBP -Jκ). 
The Notch extracellular domain is modified with different types of carbohydrates, including Asp -
linked N-glycans and several O-glycans, such as O-fucose208. O-fucose monosaccharides are 
elongated to a N-acetylglucosamine β1-3fucose (GlcNAc β1-3Fuc) disaccharide by the action of the 
Fringe N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in Drosophila melanogaster and by the Fringe homologues 
in vertebrates96,209. The disaccharide can be further elongated to the tetrasaccha ride 
Neu5Ac α2-3/6Gal β1-4GlcNAc β1-3Fuc by the sequential action of several glycosyltransferases in 
mammals96.  
Fringe was demonstrated to be a modulator of Notch activity209. Three Fringe homologues exist in 
mammals: lunatic fringe, manic fringe and radical  fringe210. Notch regulation by glycosylation, 
such as the addition of GlcNAc by Fringe, was shown to interfere with Notch –ligand interactions, 
promoting Notch –Delta binding and reducing Notch –Serrate binding96,209.  
Several studies have reviewed the mecha nisms of glycosylation in the regulation of this important 
receptor in cancer96. Glycosylation -dependent modulation of Notch signalling controls 
development, maintains tumour cell ‘stemness’ and mediates cancer metastasis96.

A01/00  Fucosylation . Fucosylation has been also associated with cancer. Fucosylated glycans are 
synthesized by a range of fucosyltransferases (Fuc ‑Ts; Fuc‑TI–Fuc‑TXI (encoded by FUT1 –FUT11, 
where FUT3 is also known as the Lewis gene, Le)), with fucosylation existing as a non ‑extendable 
modific ation and being generally sub ‑ divided into terminal fucosylation (giving rise to spe ‑ cific 
Lewis blood ‑group antigens, such as Lex and Ley  and Lea and Leb) and core fucosylation54. The 
ter‑ minal steps of the biosynthesis of SLe antigens include the α1,3‑ or α1,4‑fucosylation of a 
previously α2,3‑sialylated type  1 (SLea) or type  2 (SLex) chains54,55 (FIG.  2). The enhanced 
expression of SLex in adult T  cell leukaemia cells has been shown to be dependent on Fuc ‑TVII 
activity. The aetiologic agent of this le ukaemia, the human T ‑lymphotropic virus  1 (HTLV‑1) 
retrovirus, encodes a transcriptional activator protein, TAX, which regulates the FUT7 gene 
encoding Fuc ‑ TVII, the limiting enzyme controlling SLex synthesis in leukocytes56. In breast 
tumours, the expres sion of SLex seems to be regulated mainly by Fuc ‑TVI (encoded by FUT6)57. 
However, the biosynthesis of SLe antigens in gastro ‑ intestinal cancer may depend on the 
coordinated expres ‑ sion of several glycosyltransferases. The expression of both SLex and SLe a 
antigens expressed by glycolipids in colon cancer tissues has been related to the activation of a 
β1,3GlcNAc transferase; this enzyme synthesizes a sugar chain that is a precursor for both type  1 
and 2 Lewis structures58. A similar mechanism was observed  in gastritis induced by Helicobacter 
pylori59,60, a bacterium that expresses adhesins that recognize glycan receptors expressed by the 
gastric epithelium subsequently causing gastric ulcers and, potentially, gastric carcino genesis5 
(BOX  3). Fuc‑TVI has a lso been reported as a major enzyme modulating the SLex biosynthesis in 
colorectal cancer (CRC)61. Core fucosylation consists in the addition of α1,6‑fucose to  the 
innermost GlcNAc residue  of N‑glycans through the action of Fuc ‑TVIII (encoded by FUT8) 
(FIG. 2). Overexpression of FUT8 and core fucosylation is an important feature in several cancers, 
such as lung cancer and breast cancer62,63. This increased core fucosylation is reflected in the 
serum levels during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis64. Inte restingly, core fucosylation of 
α‑fetoprotein is an approved biomarker for the early detection of hepa ‑ tocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), distinguishing it from chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis65. In breast cancer, increased core 
fucosylation of epidermal g rowth factor receptor (EGFR) was associated with increased 
dimerization and phosphorylation, which resulted in increased EGFR ‑mediated signalling 
associated with tumour cell growth and malignancy62,66.  
Branching and bisecting GlcNAc N ‑glycans . During mali gnant transformation, a frequently 
occurring glycosylation change in cancer cells is the increased expression of complex 
β1,6‑branched N ‑linked glycans2,67 (FIGS  2,3). Increased GlcNAc ‑branching N ‑glycan 
expression is due to increased activity of GnT ‑V, which is encoded by the mannoside acetyl ‑ 
glucosaminyltransferase  5 (MGAT5) gene. MGAT5 expression is regulated by the RAS –RAF –MAPK 
sig‑ nalling pathway, which is activated in cancer67. Branched N ‑glycans are further modified by 
β1,4‑GalTs and elongated wi th poly‑N‑acetyllactosamine (repeats of Gal β1,4GlcNAc β1,3) by 
β1,3‑GnTs, and further capped with sialic acid and fucose. This poly ‑N‑acetyllactosamine 
structure is a ligand for galectins, a family of con ‑ served carbohydrate ‑binding proteins, which 
form ga lectin –glycan structures termed ‘lattices ’ (REF.  68). Galectins have important roles in 
cancer, contribut ‑ ing to neoplastic transformation, tumour cell survival, angiogenesis and tumour 
metastasis69. Overexpression of MGAT5 in an immortalized lung epithel ial cell line resulted in loss 
of contact inhibition, increased cell motility and tumour formation in athymic mice70, as well as in 
enhanced invasion and metastasis in mouse mammary carcinoma cells71. Moreover, early events in 
breast carcinoma formation in  a Her2‑transgenic mouse mammary tumour model were found to 
be regulated by GnT ‑V72. In addition, downregulation of GnT ‑V in mouse mammary cancer cell

A01/00  lines resulted in a significant suppression of tumour growth and metastasis71. Breast cancer 
progression and metastasis induced by a viral oncogene in transgenic mice is markedly sup ‑ 
pressed in Mgat5 -deficient background73. Moreover, GnT ‑V‑mediated glycosylation regulates the 
colon cancer stem cell compartment and tumour progression through WNT signalling74.  In contrast 
to the function of GnT ‑V, GnT‑III (encoded by MGAT3) catalyses the addition of bisect ‑ ing 
GlcNAc N ‑glycans in a β1,4‑linkage, suppressing additional processing and elongation of N -
glycans such as the β1,6 ‑branching structures. GnT ‑III coun‑ teracts the role of GnT ‑V in cancer, 
being involved in the suppression of cancer metastasis75. MGAT3 trans ‑ fection into mouse 
melanoma B16 cells with high metas tatic potential resulted in a significant reduction of 
β1,6GlcNAc branching (owing to GnT ‑III and GnT ‑V enzymatic competition), leading to a 
significant sup ‑ pression of lung metastasis in mice. GnT ‑III suppresses tumour metastasis through 
the regulation of key glyco ‑ proteins, such as EGFR, integrins and cadherins66,76, as 
described  below.  
Truncat ed O‑glycans. Another common feature of tumours is the overexpression of truncated 
O‑glycans (FIGS  2,3). The GalNAc ‑type O‑glycans, also called mucin ‑ type O‑glycans, are 
frequently found in most transmem ‑ brane and secreted glycoproteins. During malignanc y, 
aberrant glycosylation also occurs in glycoproteins that display abnormal expression of shortened 
or truncated glycans, such as the disaccharide Thomsen –Friedenreich antigen (T antigen, also 
known as core  1) and the mono ‑ saccharide GalNAc (also known a s Tn) and their sia ‑ lylated forms 
(ST and STn (Neu5Ac α2‑6GalNAc α‑O‑R), respectively), which result from the incomplete 
synthesis of O ‑glycans77. Altered expression of polypeptide GalNAc trans ‑ ferases (ppGalNAcTs) 
— the enzymes initiating the mucin ‑type O‑glycosylation12,13 — is often observed in cancer78,79. 
The ppGalNAcTs control the sites and density of O ‑glycan occupancy12,13, and changes in their 
expression lead to alterations in O ‑glycosylation80. In addition, enzymes competing for the same 
substrate  can also induce expression of truncated glycans and exposure of protein epitopes that 
would other ‑ wise be hidden in the normally glycosylated protein. The relative enzymatic activities 
of C2GnT and α2,3 ‑sialyltransferase  I (ST3Gal ‑I) have been shown to d etermine the O ‑glycan 
structure in cancer cells81. These relative activities underlie the aberrant expres ‑ sion of a 
tumour‑associated epitopes on glycoproteins, such as mucins in breast81 and gastric82 cancers. 
STn is rarely expressed in normal healthy ti ssues but can be detected in most carcinomas, such as 
those from the pancreas83,84, stomach23,85,86, colorectum23,87, breast38, bladder88 and 
ovary89, correlating with decreased cancer cell adhesion, increased tumour growth, increased 
tumour cell migration , invasion and poor prognosis. The abnormal synthesis of STn in cancer occurs 
owing to the overexpression of ST6GalNAc ‑I. Mutations in T ‑synthase C1GalT1 ‑specific chap ‑ 
erone  1 (C1GALT1C1) — which blocks further O ‑glycan elongation and shifts the pathway towards 
generation of Tn — can also lead to STn expres sion through the action of ST6GalNAc ‑I90,91 
(FIG.  2). 
Therefore, STn has been proposed as an important prognostic marker and a target for the design of  
antican cer vaccines92,93.

A01/00  Box 2 | GPI -anchored proteins and disease  
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins are formed by a glycan bridge between 
phosphatidylinositol and a phosphoethanolamine, which is then linked to the carboxy -terminal 
amino a cid of a protein. This structure typically constitutes the only anchor to the lipid bilayer 
membrane for some proteins8. Mutation in the GPI phosphatidylinositol 
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A ( PIGA ) gene leads to defects in the synthesis of the  GPI 
anchor, resulting in deficiency of all GPI -bound proteins. Haematopoietic stem cells that are 
defective in GPI anchor assembly owing to a mutation in the PIGA gene preferentially expand in the 
bone marrow and give rise to defective peripheral blood el ements that are deficient in GPI -
anchored protein expression. Mutation in the X -linked PIGA gene causes paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria, a disease characterized by haemolytic anaemia, thrombosis and impaired bone 
marrow function, with an increased ris k of developing leukaemia211.  
 
Glycosylation in the cancer cell  
Glycans have been found to participate in numerous fun ‑ damental biological processes involved in 
cancer, such as inflammation (BOX  3), immune surveillance, cell –cell adhesion76,94,95, cell –matrix 
interaction76, inter ‑ and intracellular signalling96 –99, and cellular metabolism100,101 (FIG.  4). 
Furthermore, glycans alter protein conformation and structure, thereby modulating the functional 
activity of the protein102. Unravelling the biological  significance of glycan ‑based interactions in 
cancer can contribute to the deciphering of m olecular mechanisms underlying  the biology 
of cancer.  
Glycosylation in tumour cell –cell adhesion.  The devel ‑ opment of malignant tumours is in part 
characterized by  the ability of a tumour cell to overcome cell –cell adhesion and to invade 
surrounding tissue. Epithelial cadherin (E ‑cadherin) is a transmembrane glycopro ‑ tein103 and a 
major epithelial cell –cell adhesion mole ‑ cule in cancer104. Glycans can have a profo und effect on 
tumour cell –cell adhesion by directly interfering with E ‑cadherin functions. GnT ‑V overexpression 
in gastric cancer cells induces E ‑cadherin cellular mislocalization from the cell membrane into the 
cytoplasm and its functional impairment94,95 . The addition of GnT ‑V‑mediated 
β1,6GlcNAc ‑branched N ‑glycans to E ‑cadherin leads to incorrectly assembled and 
non‑functional adherens junctions, which compromise cell –cell adhesion94,95,105 and 
downstream signalling pathways106, contributing to tumour in vasiveness and metastases107. 
Preventing this aberrant glycosylation in a specific Asp site improves E ‑cadherin functions in 
cancer108. Interestingly, patients with gastric carcinoma displaying loss of E ‑cadherin function (not 
explained at the genetic or s tructural level) exhibit an increase in β1,6GlcNAc ‑branched N ‑glycans 
on E‑cadherin5,94. Conversely, GnT ‑III‑mediated bisecting GlcNAc N ‑glycans counteract GnT ‑V 
activity through E ‑cadherin regulation75,94. This E ‑cadherin glycan modification was associated 
with a delayed turnover rate at cell membrane94,109, inhibition of endocytosis94, decreased 
phosphorylation of β ‑catenin that remained in complex with E ‑cadherin110, and increased 
stability of adherens junctions, promoting tumour suppression5,94 ,95. Moreover, expression of 
GnT‑III is also associated with suppression of epithelial ‑to‑mesenchymal transition28,111. 
Therefore, a mutual regulatory mechanism between E ‑cadherin‑mediated cell –cell adhesion and 
its glycosylation exists in cancer, which is  controlled by the competitive action of GnT ‑III and

A01/00  GnT‑V, and can culminate in either tumour suppression or tumour metastasis, respectively5,112 
(FIG.  4). Cancer cells produce increased levels of sialylated glycans, leading to the high expression of 
tumo ur‑ associated antigens2,113. Increased expression of sialylated antigens promotes cell 
detachment from the  tumour mass through electrostatic repulsion of nega ‑ tive charges, which 
physically inhibits and disrupts cell –cell adhesion114,115. Transfection of  breast cancer cells with 
ST6Gal‑I results in increased cell migra ‑ tion and decreased cell –cell adhesion in  vitro116 (FIG.  4). 
Furthermore, sialylated glycans (such as SLex) can pro ‑ mote the adhesion of tumour cells to 
vascular endothe ‑ lial cells throug h their interaction with selectins, such as E ‑selectin, mediating 
the initial steps of the forma ‑ tion of cancer metastases2 (FIG.  4). In addition, de  novo expression of 
STn in gastric carcinoma cells modulates the malignant phenotype, inducing more ‑aggres sive cell 
behaviour, with decreased cell –cell aggregation and increased matrix interaction, migration and 
invasion85. RNA interference ‑mediated gene silencing of ST6GALNAC1 suppresses the metastatic 
potential of gastric cancer cells owin g to a reduction in  expression of insulin growth factor  I (IGF‑I) 
and reduced activa ‑ tion of signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT5B 117. 
Furthermore, somatic mutations and hyper ‑ methylation of C1GALT1C1 have shown that loss of 
C1GALT1C1 function leads to STn expression, preventing cell –cell interactions and contact 
inhibition of cell growth in cancer cells84. Clinically, increased sialylation is often associated with 
invasiveness  and poor prognosis of cancer patients44,47.  
Glycosylation in cell –matrix interaction and signalling . The extracellular matrix (ECM) is composed of 
a dynamic and complex array of glycoproteins, collagens, GAGs and proteoglycans. It provides 
mechanical and structural sup ‑ port, as well as spatial context, for signalling events, with direct 
implications in tumour development, maintenance of stem cell niches and cancer progression118. 
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are present on the cell surface and in  the ECM and can 
modulate cell growth and differentiation, controlling embryogenesis, angiogenesis and 
homeostasis. HSPGs contain one or more covalently attached heparan sulfate GAG chains119. 
There are different groups of HSPGs classified according to the ir location: membrane HSPGs, such 
as syndecans and the GPI ‑anchored proteoglycans, the glypicans; the ECM HSPGs, such as agrin, 
perlecan and type XVIII collagen; and the secretory ‑vesicle HSPG, serglycin119. HSPGs can bind 
cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, protecting them against proteolysis; in addition, HSPGs 
can act as co ‑receptors for various growth factors for tyrosine kinase receptors, lowering their 
activation thresholds or changing the duration of their signalling reactions119 (FIG.  4). 
Over expression of proteoglycans occurs in several cancers in which the heparan sulfate chains 
covalently bound to the proteoglycans can modulate the activation of protein receptors, such as 
HER2, EGFR, MET (also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR )) and transforming 
growth factor ‑β (TGF β)120. Heparan sulfate chains regulate the interactions121, and increase the 
solubility, of various signalling molecules122, therefore increasing their access to receptors and 
facilitating signal transduction. For in stance, heparan sulfate chains can release HGF, inducing cell 
growth and motility through interaction with MET121, which is frequently activated in cancer 
cells99 (FIG.  4). Heparan sulfate chains can also release vascular endothelial growth factor  A 
(VEGFA ), a regulator of angiogenesis that stimulates growth, motility, and tubulogenesis in 
vascular endothelial cells through interactions with VEGF receptor  1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2 
(REF.  121). Another important membrane receptor involved in matrix ‑dependent cell  motility and 
migration is CD44, which is the main receptor for hyaluronic acid. CD44 is a multifunctional cell 
surface molecule involved in can ‑ cer cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and sig ‑ 
nalling123. CD44 splicing variants have been assoc iated with tumour development and 
progression124. The role of CD44 glycosylation in matrix ‑dependent cell adhe ‑ sion, motility and

A01/00  migration is far from being elucidated. Nevertheless, evidence has shown that changes in glyco ‑ 
sylation of CD44 can markedly  influence hyaluronic acid ligand recognition and binding, modifying 
cancer cell signalling125. Treatments of CD44 with inhibitors of glycosylation and de ‑glycosylating 
enzymes signifi ‑ cantly change the binding to hyaluronic acid, modulating CD44 ‑dependen t 
signalling and function126. Moreover, glycosylation modification of CD44 induced by transfection 
of α1,2–Fuc‑T enhanced cell motility and tumori ‑ genicity in rat carcinoma cells127. Additionally, 
GAG forms of CD44 containing chondroitin and heparin sul ‑ fate chains modulate the binding of 
tumour cells to fibro ‑ nectin128. Proteoglycans are also involved in the biogenesis and recognition 
of exosomes, which are secreted vesicles of endosomal origin involved in signalling processes129. 
Syndecans control the interaction with key acces ‑ sory components of the endosomal ‑sorting 
complexes required for transport machinery. In addition, hepara ‑ nase modulates 
syndecan ‑controlled pathways, foster ‑ ing endosomal membrane budding and the biogenesis of 
exosomes by trim ming the heparan sulfate chains on syndecans and controlling the selection of 
specific cargo to exosomes129. Hyaluronidases also have many roles in cancer metastasis by 
participating in the degradation of the ECM surrounding the tumour, enabling cancer cel ls to 
disseminate from the primary tumour and allowing invasion by degradation of the basement 
membrane and by clearing the ECM of the secondary site130. Recent studies demonstrated that 
expression of bulky glycoproteins in the cancer cell glycocalyx facil itates integrin clustering by 
funnelling active integrins into adhesions and by applying tension to matrix ‑bound integrins, 
independently of actomyosin contractility131. Expression of large tumour ‑associated glycoproteins 
in non‑transformed cells facilitat es integrin ‑dependent growth factor signalling to support cell 
survival, further confirming that alterations of glycoprotein expres ‑ sion in the cancer cell 
glycocalyx could foster invasion and metastasis by mechanically enhancing cell ‑surface receptor 
function131. Cell –ECM interactions play essential parts during the acquisition of migration and 
invasive behaviour of tumour cells132. Integrins are carriers of N ‑glycans and are important 
receptors for signals in the ECM and connect many biological functions, such as cell proliferation, 
protection against apoptosis and malignant transformation131. Integrin expression is upregulated 
in migratory cells associated with tumour metastases133. N ‑glycans on α5β1 integrin, a receptor 
for fibronectin (encoded  by FN1), are required for αβ ‑heterodimer formation and for proper 
integrin –matrix inter action76. Changes in N ‑glycans in cancer can regulate integrins functions. 
Transformation of NIH3T3 cells with an oncogenic RAS gene resulted in enhancement of cell 
spreading on fibronectin due to increased modifica ‑ tion of α5β1 integrins with 
β1,6GlcNAc ‑branching N ‑glycans134 through the upregulation of the  
 RAS –RAF –MAPK signalling pathway and subsequent activation of MGAT5 transcription. Similarly, 
over‑ expression of human fibrosarcoma cells with GnT ‑V resulted in an increased cell migration 
towards fibro ‑ nectin and invasion through the Matrigel due to an increase in β1,6‑branching 
N‑glycans on α5β1 integrin135. Moreover, the characterization of carbohydrate moieti es of 
α3β1  integrin, the receptor for laminin ‑5 showed that β1,6GlcNAc ‑branched structures were 
highly expressed in metastatic human melanoma cells136. Changes in N ‑linked β1,6‑branching 
occurring dur ‑ ing oncogenesis alter cell –matrix adhesion and migrati on by inhibiting the clustering 
of integrins and subsequent signal transduction pathways136. In contrast to the over ‑ expression of 
GnT‑V, the overexpression of GnT ‑III resulted in an inhibition of α5β1 integrin‑mediated cell 
spreading and migration, and t he phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The affinity of 
the binding of α5β1  integrin to fibronectin was greatly reduced as a result of the introduction of a 
bisecting GlcNAc N ‑glycans on the α5 subunit137. Similarly, in MKN45 gas ‑ tric cancer cells, the 
overexpression of GnT ‑III suppresses α3β1 integrin‑mediated cell migration on laminin ‑5,

A01/00  counteracting the GnT ‑V activity138. Overall, GnT ‑III is described to suppress cancer metastases 
by at least two major mechanisms: an enhanceme nt in cell –cell adhesion and a downregulation of 
cell–ECM adhesion139. Furthermore, an increased terminal α2,6 ‑sialylation of integrins N ‑glycans 
can control cancer cell migratory and metastatic potential, interfering with the ligand ‑ binding 
properties of  integrins101,140. Analysis of cancer cells that overexpress ST6Gal1 consistently 
indicates altered adhesion of cells to ECM substrates, such as colla gen, fibronectin and laminin in 
colon cancer141 and breast cancer cell lines116. Additionally, altered N ‑glycosylation of integrins 
can have an impact on their cis ‑interaction with membrane ‑ associated receptors, including 
EGFR142 and the tetra ‑ spanin family of proteins, as well as gangliosides in the microdomain. 
Glycosylation of α3β1 integrin was dem ‑ onst rated to regulate its association with the tetra spanin 
CD151, modulating cell spreading and motility143. Therefore, changes in the N ‑glycosylation 
profile of integ ‑ rins modulate tumour cell motility and migration through interference with the 
supramolecu lar complex formation (tumour cell focal adhesions) on the cell surface. In the 
formation of these focal adhesions, integrins interact with HSPG on the surface of tumour cells144. 
Syndecan ‑4 is frequently upregulated in a range of cancers145; it binds to f ibronectin and 
laminin‑5 enhancing the function of β1 integrin during cell spreading146. Similarly, syndecan ‑1 
was described to functionally couple with αvβ3 integrin in breast cancer cells, resulting in increased 
αvβ3‑dependent cell spreading and migratio n147.  
Box 3 | Glycosylation at the interface of inflammation -induced cancer  
During inflammation, a considerable number of glycosylation changes occur, and some of these 
have been associated with the carcinogenesis process. Helicobacter pylori , a Gram -negative 
bacterium specialized in the colonization of the human stomach, can cause gastric ulcers, and 
persistent infection may cause chronic atrophic gastritis with the development of intestinal 
metaplasia, dysplasia and gastric carcinoma5. The a dhesion of H. pylori to the gastric mucosa is 
mediated by different bacterial adhesins that recognize glycans expressed by the gastric mucosa. 
The antigen -binding adhesin BabA binds to fucosylated antigens normally expressed by secretor 
individuals212, and  the sialic acid -binding adhesin SabA recognizes sialylated Lewis glycans (sialyl 
Lewis a (SLea) and SLex) expressed in gastritis213. Inflammation -induced glycosylation alterations, 
such as the aberrant overexpression of SLex, occur because of changes in g lycosyltransferases 
expression59,60,214. Changes in glycosylation have also been studied in acute -phase proteins, such 
as α1 antitrypsin, as potential biomarkers in cancer and in acute and chronic inflammatory 
conditions215. Furthermore, glycosylation alte rations have been shown to correlate with disease 
severity in certain inflammatory conditions, such as in inflammatory bowel disease216. In addition, 
glycosylation alterations have been reported in circulating proteins produced by the liver in patients 
with inflammatory diseases, such as gastritis203 and pancreatitis215.  
Several studies have shown that the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is enriched in 
red meat, an epidemiological risk factor for cancer development217. Humans cannot synthesi ze 
Neu5Gc because the human gene cytidine monophosphate -N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase 
(CMAH ), which encodes the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of CMP -Neu5Gc from 
CMP -N-acetylneuraminic (CMP -Neu5Ac) acid is irreversibly mutated. The active form of CMAH is 
found in apes218, and the mutated CMAH form is estimated to have originated 2 –3 million years 
ago, prior to the emergence of the genus Homo 218. Neu5Gc has been shown to be bioavailable, 
undergoing metabolic incorporation into human tissues. Huma n-like Neu5Gc -deficient mice have 
been shown to develop inflammatory conditions when fed with Neu5Gc and challenged with

demonstrate the potential role in cancer de velopment of the sialic acid Neu5Gc and provide an 
explanation for the epidemiological association between red meat consumption, inflammation and 
cancer risk.  
Glycosylation in cancer metabolism and signalling.  A key feature of cancer cell metabolism is a s hift 
from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect)148, which is 
characterized by high rates of glucose uptake to cope with the increased energetic and biosynthetic 
needs to generate a tumour. Additionally, to help meet increased  biosynthetic demands, cancer 
cells also upregulate glutamine uptake. The abundance of glucose in the cytoplasm of cancer cells 
not only contributes to increased glycolysis but also increases flux into the metabolic branch 
pathways, such as the hexo samine  biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Approximately 3 –5% of the total 
glucose entering a cell is shunted through this pathway149. Therefore, increased glucose and 
glutamine uptake by cancer cells probably drives increased HBP flux. The end ‑product of HBP is 
uridine  diphosphate (UDP) ‑GlcNAc, which is a critical metabolite that is subsequently used for O-
GlcNAcylation as well as for  O- and N‑glycosylation150. Given O ‑GlcNAcylation responsiveness 
to the glucose flux, O ‑GlcNAc can act as a ‘nutritional sensor’ (REF.  151). Increased levels of 
O‑GlcNAc transferase (OGT) have been found in breast cancer, and knockdown of OGT in  vitro 
reduces cancer hyper ‑O‑GlcNAcylation and inhibits tumour growth, invasion and metastasis, 
further indicating that elevated O ‑GlcNAc c ontributes to cancer progression152 –154. Moreover, 
O‑GlcNAc modulates key protein functions by regulating protein phosphorylation, altering protein 
degradation, controlling protein localization and mediating transcription155. O ‑GlcNAc modi ‑ 
fications have been implicated in key molecular events occurring in cancer, such as tumour cell 
proliferation (by regulating the activities of transcription factor forkhead box protein  M1(FoxM1) 
and cyclin  D1, which are both involved in cell cycle progression154), cancer  cell survival and 
angiogenesis (through the effect of hyper ‑O‑Glc‑ NAcylation (via activation of nuclear 
factor  κB‑mediated signalling153) and upregulation of VEGFA and matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs)156, respectively), and cancer cell invasion and metas tasis (through O ‑GlcNAc  regulation 
of E‑cadherin trafficking and function)157. Many oncogene and tumour ‑suppressor gene products 
were shown to be modified by O ‑GlcNAc158. MYC undergoes O ‑GlcNAcylation at Thr58, which is 
also a phosphorylation site. In fac t, O‑GlcNAcylation has extensive crosstalk with phosphorylation 
and serves as a nutrient sensor to modulate signalling, transcription and cytoskeletal functions158. 
Altered phosphory lation events affect GlcNAcylation levels and vice versa. Increased MYC 
O‑GlcNAcylation competes with phos ‑ phorylation, stabilizing MYC and thus contributing to 
oncogenesis159. This type of interplay also occurs with the p53 tumour ‑suppressor protein160. 
Similarly to O ‑GlcNAcylation, N ‑glycan branching is nutrient sensitive, wi th functional 
consequences for the cancer cell. The degree of N ‑glycan branching modulates the activity and/or 
signalling and surface retention of many cell surface proteins, including growth factor receptors97. 
Cell surface glycoprotein receptors have dif ferent number of N ‑glycan sites. The number of 
N‑glycans is defined by the protein sequence of each glycoprotein, and the types of N -glycan 
structures are determined by the Golgi N ‑glycan‑processing pathway and metabolite sup ‑ ply to 
sugar –nucleotide pools 161. Receptors that stimu ‑ late cell proliferation, growth and oncogenesis 
(such as EGFR, IGF receptor (IGFR), fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) and platelet ‑derived growth 
factor (PDGFR)) have more N ‑glycan sites (8 –16 Asn‑X‑Ser/Thr sites, in which X is any  amino acid) 
per 100 amino acids, and longer extracellular domains. Conversely, growth ‑arrest receptors 
involved in organogenesis and differentiation (such as TGFβ receptor  1 (TGFβR1) and TGFβR2) have 
few N‑glycan sites161. Lau et  al. proposed a mechanism for metabolic regulation of cellular

A01/00  transition between cell proliferation and arrest and/or differentiation that arises from the 
cooperation of complex N ‑glycan num ‑ ber and the degree of branching structures161. Changes in 
metabolic flux through the HBP affect the stability and retention of receptors at the cell surface by 
modulating the interaction of branched N ‑glycans with galectin ‑3 (REFS  162,163). The galectin ‑3 
lattice restricts receptor endocytosis, enhancing the signalling68,161. Hence, the more N ‑glycan 
sites, the more β1,6‑branching structures are added, which crosslink with galectins, precluding 
endocytosis and thereby increasing signalling161,162. Mammary carcinoma cells derived from 
polyomavirus middle T (PyMT) Mgat5−/− ‑transgenic mice are les s responsive to IGF, EGF, PDGF, 
FGF and TGF β compared with Mgat5+/+ tumour cells, showing reduced galectin ‑3 binding and 
internalization of receptors from the cell surface to endosomes164. Similarly, human cancer cells 
with targeted silencing of the MGAT5 gene also exhibit reduced EGFR signalling165. Sensitivity to 
EGF and TGFβ cytokines was rescued by hexosamine supplementation with UDP ‑GlcNAc or by 
GnT‑V expression, implying that remodelling of N ‑glycans in tumour cells is sensitive to 
metabolism161. Acco rdingly, the decrease of galectin lattice interactions induced by the addition of 
bisecting GlcNAc N ‑glycans counterbalances the highly branched N ‑glycosylation of EGFR and 
PDGFR, restraining its downstream signalling and in this way retarding mam ‑ mary tu mour 
progression166. GnT ‑III overexpression reduces the ability of EGF to bind to its receptor, blocking 
EGFR‑mediated ERK phosphorylation and increasing EGFR endocytosis167. Increasing intracellular 
metabolic flux with UDP ‑GlcNAc promotes a hyperbolic act ivation profile for high ‑n receptors 
(receptors with a high number of N ‑glycan sites (growth receptors)) and a sigmoid or switch ‑like 
profile for low ‑n receptors (receptors with a reduced number of N ‑glycan sites (arrest receptors)), 
thereby regulating the  transition between cell growth and differentiation161. Overall, the nutrient 
flux that regulates complex N ‑glycan biosynthesis coordinates the cellular response of tumour cells 
determining growth, invasion and drug sensitivity100. Interestingly, the prese nce of branching 
N‑glycans on VEGFR2 interacting with galectin ‑1 underlies an aberrant and compensatory 
angiogenesis mechanism associated with tumour growth in tumours resistant to anti ‑VEGF

Ectopic expression or inhibition of specific glycosyltransferases modifying gangliosides regulates

Altered glycosylation in cancer cells affects cell adhesion and migration through modulation of glycan-binding proteins and cell surface receptors, leading to changes in cell signaling and communication.

Research Proposal:
To investigate the impact of glycosylation alterations on cancer cell adhesion and migration, we propose to conduct a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The research will involve analyzing the expression and activity of glycosyltransferases, galectins, and glycan-binding proteins in cancer cells with altered glycosylation patterns. Additionally, the effects of glycosylation alterations on cell surface receptors, such as EGFR, IGF receptor, and integrins, will be studied to understand their role in modulating cell adhesion and migration. Furthermore, the investigation will include assessing the impact of glycosylation alterations on downstream signaling pathways and the formation of glycan-protein complexes. Overall, this research aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which altered glycosylation influences cancer cell adhesion and migration, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment."

Telomeres prevent chromosome ends from being repaired
as double-strand breaks (DSBs). Telomere identity inDrosophila is determined epigenetically with no sequence
either necessary or sufﬁcient. To better understand this
sequence-independent capping mechanism, we isolatedproteins that interact with the HP1/ORC-associated pro-tein (HOAP) capping protein, and identiﬁed HipHop as asubunit of the complex. Loss of one protein destabilizes
the other and renders telomeres susceptible to fusion. Both
HipHop and HOAP are enriched at telomeres, where theyalso interact with the conserved HP1 protein. We devel-oped a model telomere lacking repetitive sequences tostudy the distribution of HipHop, HOAP and HP1 usingchromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). We discovered
that they occupy a broad region 410 kb from the chromo-
some end and their binding is independent of the under-lying DNA sequence. HipHop and HOAP are both rapidlyevolving proteins yet their telomeric deposition is underthe control of the conserved ATM and Mre11–Rad50–Nbs
(MRN) proteins that modulate DNA structures at
telomeres and at DSBs. Our characterization of HipHopand HOAP reveals functional analogies between theDrosophila proteins and subunits of the yeast and mam-malian capping complexes, implicating conservation inepigenetic capping mechanisms.

Introduction
Telomeres shield the ends of linear chromosomes from DNA
repair activities. This capping function is essential for
genome integrity, as uncapping can lead to chromosomefusions. Telomeres also facilitate the elongation of chromo-
some ends, a function performed by the telomerase enzyme
in most eukaryotic organisms studied. Loss of telomerase
function does not impair genome stability immediately, butonly does so when telomeric repeats become critically shortafter several generations (Blasco et al, 1997; Riha et al, 2001;
Meier et al, 2006). However, loss of the capping function can
have immediate effects on genome integrity (van Steensel et al,
1998; Baumann and Cech, 2001; Ferreira and Cooper, 2001;Pardo and Marcand, 2005; Song et al, 2008), suggesting that the
presence of telomeric repeats is not sufﬁcient for maintainingtelomere identity. Furthermore, specialized yeast and plant
cells can be immortalized in the absence of telomeric repeats
with protected telomeres, suggesting that the presence of therepeats is also not necessary for capping (Maringele and Lydall,2004; Watson et al, 2005). These results suggest that sequence-
independent capping might serve as a backup mechanism in
telomerase-maintained organisms.
The understanding of this mechanism requires a clear picture
of chromatin structure at telomeres. In lower eukaryotes, telo-meric repeats are not packaged into regular nucleosomes(Wright et al, 1992), while the bulk of telomeric repeats in
mammalian cells are packaged into nucleosome arrays
(Makarov et al, 1993; Tommerup et al, 1994). Partly due to
the repetitive nature of telomer ic sequences, it has been difﬁcult
to study how duplex-binding proteins are distributed overtelomeric chromatin in most organisms. The Rap1 protein
from budding yeast binds telomeric repeats (Conrad et al,
1990) to serve its functions in telomere elongation and cappingregulation (Marcand et al, 1997; Pardo and Marcand, 2005).
Interestingly, Rap1 from budding and ﬁssion yeast and Taz1from ﬁssion yeast have been localized to subtelomeric regions
(Strahl-Bolsinger et al, 1997; Kanoh et al,2 0 0 5 ) ,s u g g e s t i n gt h a t
the binding of capping proteins need not be limited to theextreme end of a chromosome.
In Drosophila, telomere identity is determined epigenetically.
Although telomeres are elongated by the transposition of telo-mere-speciﬁc retrotransposons, these elements are neither ne-
cessary nor sufﬁcient for capping (reviewed in Rong, 2008a). In
particular, terminally deleted chromosomes that lack telomeric
retrotransposons are stable, hence capped, for many generations( L e v i s ,1 9 8 9 ;B i e s s m a n n et al, 1992; Ahmad and Golic, 1998). In
addition, population studies uncovered frequent occurrences of
such terminally deleted chromosomes in natural populations
(Kern and Begun, 2008).
Despite using a telomerase-independent mechanism for
elongating chromosome ends, Drosophila use highly con-served factors to regulate capping. The ATM and ATR check-point kinases, along with the Mre11–Rad50–Nbs (MRN)
complex and the ATRIP protein, respectively, control redun-
dant pathways for capping regulation that are conservedin other organisms (Bi et al, 2005; Ciapponi et al, 2006;
Oikemus et al, 2006). Several other proteins serving capping

HP1 (Fanti et al, 1998), UbcD1 (Cenci et al, 1997), Woc (Raffa
et al, 2005) and the H2A.Z histone variant (Rong, 2008b).
Epigenetic capping mechanisms that might be conserved in
other organisms can be effectively studied in the uniquesystem of Drosophila due to the natural uncoupling of theend capping function from the end elongation function.
Telomeres in yeast and mammals are capped by multi-
subunit protein complexes that protect both the duplex and
single-stranded regions of the telomere (Liu et al, 2004; Gao
et al, 2007; Miyoshi et al, 2008). In Drosophila, the structural
constituents of the ‘cap’ remain poorly deﬁned. The HP1/ORC-associated protein (HOAP) is cytologically present at telo-meres, and loss of HOAP leads to telomere fusions (Shareef
et al, 2001; Cenci et al, 2003). In this study, we isolated HOAP-
interacting proteins by afﬁnity immunoprecipitation, and iden-tiﬁed the HP1-HOAP-interacting protein (HipHop) as a newcomponent of the Drosophila capping complex. Using chro-matin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) performed on a modeltelomere devoid of telomeric transposons, we discovered a
large domain of telomeric chromatin enriched with HipHop,
HOAP and HP1, suggesting that this capping complex preventsend fusion by maintaining a chromatin state that is indepen-dent of its underlying DNA sequence. Both HipHop and HOAPare fast-evolving proteins highlighting a common feature
among telomeric-binding proteins in other organisms. On the
basis of functional similarity and analogies in distributionpatterns, we suggest that HipHop and HOAP serve similarfunction as subunits of the capping complex that bind theduplex region of telomeric DNA in other organisms.
Results
Isolation of HOAP-interacting proteins identiﬁed
HipHop
To isolate HOAP-interacting proteins by afﬁnity puriﬁcation,we tagged the endogenous HOAP-encoding caravaggio (cav)
locus with a myc epitope tag at its N-terminus using genetargeting (Supplementary Figure S1). The myc-HOAP proteinis functional in that ﬂies with the myc-cav locus are viable
and fertile whereas cavmutants are lethal (Cenci et al, 2003).
We veriﬁed that a signiﬁcant fraction of the cellular HOAPproteins are tightly associated with chromatin as reportedearlier (Shareef et al , 2001), and generated a nuclease
solublized chromatin extract from 0 to 12 h embryos for IP.
Protein mixtures pulled down with an anti-myc antibody
were analysed by mass spectrometry. As expected, peptidesfrom HOAP were abundant in the ‘myc-tagged’ but not the‘untagged’ extracts (Supplementary Figure S2). In anti-mycprecipitants from the ‘tagged’ extracts, we also identiﬁed
peptides from HP1, a known HOAP-interacting protein, and
peptides from a third protein encoded by the CG6874 gene
(also known as l(3)neo26 ).
We veriﬁed the interaction between the CG6874 protein
and HOAP using three different approaches. First, we gener-ated an antibody against CG6874 and detected its presence in
anti-myc IPs from myc-HOAP extracts but not from untagged
extracts (left panels in Figure 1A). In a reciprocal experiment,anti-CG6874, but not its pre-immune serum, precipitatedHOAP and HP1 from wild-type embryonic extracts (rightpanels in Figure 1A). Second, we puriﬁed GST-CG6874 fusion
protein from bacteria and tested its ability to physicallyinteract with HOAP in chromatin extracts from wild-type
embryos. As shown in Figure 1C, GST-CG6874 producedfrom the ‘221’ construct, but not the ‘GST only’ control,
precipitated both HOAP and HP1 from the extract. Using
this assay, we mapped the domain in CG6874 that is respon-sible for interacting with HOAP and HP1 to the ﬁrst 99 aminoacids (‘N99’ in Figure 1B and C). In the third approach, wedemonstrated the ability of myc-tagged HOAP and FLAG-tagged CG6874 proteins to interact in co-transfection experi-
ments using S2 cells (Supplementary Figure S3). On the basis
of results from these approaches, we conclude that CG6874strongly interacts with HOAP and HP1, and named CG6874 asthe HP1-HOAP-interacting protein, or HipHop.
HipHop protects telomeres from fusion
To establish HipHop’s function in capping we set out to
disrupt its function. The cav
1mutation in the gene encoding
HOAP causes abundant telomere fusion in proliferating cells(Cenci et al, 2003). We expected a similar phenotype when
HipHop function is disrupted. We used RNAi to reduce thelevel of HipHop in S2 cells, and performed mitotic chromo-
some spread to assay telomere uncapping. As a control, we
treated cells with RNAi reagents that were highly effective inknocking down gfpexpression (Wei et al, 2000). We observed
telomere fusion in none of the gfp-RNAi-treated cells, but
abundant fusion in 58% of the cav-RNAi-treated cells, and in
57% of the hiphop -RNAi-treated cells (Figure 2A). To quanti-
fy the degree of telomere uncapping in these RNAi-treated
cells, we measured the frequency of double telomere fusionsthat involve two pairs of sister telomeres, as this type offusion constitutes the majority class in cav
1larval neuroblasts
(Cenci et al, 2003; Bi et al, 2005). As shown in Figure 2C,
knocking down HOAP or HipHop caused similar degrees of
uncapping. In addition, double knockdown of both HOAP andHipHop further enhanced uncapping, suggesting that eachsingle knockdown resulted in a partial loss of function. Thisis consistent with western blot results showing partial reduc-tion of the target proteins in RNAi-treated cells (Figure 2B).
We observed an interesting interdependence of HOAP and
HipHop protein stability as knocking down one protein led toa concomitant reduction of the other with knocking downHOAP having a larger effect on HipHop level (Figure 2B). Wealso observed a reduced level of HipHop in extracts for
homozygous cav
1mutant larvae (Figure 2B), consistent
with results from knocking down HOAP in S2 cells. Thisinterdependence of protein stability is consistent withHipHop and HOAP forming a complex as suggested by ourearlier biochemical results.
HipHop is a rapidly evolving protein
The predicted HipHop protein has 221 residues. Blast
searches did not identify homologs in non-Drosophilidaeorganisms. Alignments among HipHop homologs fromDrosophila species revealed large areas of sequence diver-gence (Supplementary Figure S4; Supplementary Table S1), asituation reminiscent of that for HOAP, which has been
classiﬁed as one of the fastest evolving proteins in
Drosophila (Schmid and Tautz, 1997). To provide evidencethat HipHop is also rapidly evolving, we calculated the dNvalue for all pairwise comparisons between hiphop genes
from Drosophila melanogaster and other Drosophila species.
dN is the number of replacement mutations (non-synon-Interaction of HipHop with HOAP and HP1 to protect Drosophila telomeres

The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 4 |2010 &2010 European Molecular Biology Organization 820ymous substitutions) per non-synonymous site (codon sites
that would result in an amino-acid change when altered). Forcomparisons, we also calculated dN values for the cav,
su(var)205 and catgenes (Figure 3). su(var)205 encodes
HP1, a conserved protein with a role in telomere capping inDrosophila (Fanti et al , 1998). catencodes Catalase, an
enzyme highly conserved in aerobically respiring organisms.It was chosen as a control locus because it abuts hiphop on
the chromosome. The dN values for hiphop andcavincrease
dramatically as the evolutionary distance between a species
and D. melanogaster increases. In contrast, only a moderate
increase was observed for su(var)205 , and the dN values for
catremain the lowest of the four genes. Therefore, HipHop
seems to also evolve faster than typical proteins.HipHop is predominantly enriched at telomeres
HipHop’s intimate interaction with HOAP suggests that theymay be similarly distributed, that is predominantly at telo-
meres. This was conﬁrmed in immunostaining experiments
performed ﬁrst on the polytene chromosomes from larvalsalivary glands where we observed strong HipHop signals onall telomeres (Figure 4A). In double-staining experiments,HipHop co-localized with HOAP at telomeres (Figure 4B).We also studied HipHop localization in cycling cells from
the larval brain and S2-cultured cells. In mitotic cells, HipHop
is highly enriched at telomeres and co-localizes very wellwith HOAP (Figure 5A and B). During interphase, bothHipHop and HOAP localize to multiple foci that possiblycorrespond to telomeres (Supplementary Figure S5), which

(Rashkova et al, 2002).
HOAP localization to telomeres is controlled by a set of
DNA damage checkpoint/repair proteins that include ATM
and the MRN complex (reviewed in Rong, 2008a). Wediscovered that HipHop binding to telomeres is similarly
regulated. On polytene chromosomes, HipHop was absentfrom mre11 -o rnbs-mutant telomeres and greatly reduced on

The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 4 |2010 &2010 European Molecular Biology Organization 822localization was greatly reduced by null mutations of either
mre11 ornbs (Figure 5D and E). More speciﬁcally, we
detected HipHop on at least two telomeres in 100% of the
wild-type cells, but only in 23% of mre11 -null cells and in
36% of nbs-null cells, a situation very similar to HOAP
localization as reported earlier (Bi et al , 2004, 2005;
Ciapponi et al, 2004, 2006). HipHop binding to atm-mutant
telomeres was not severely affected in that 86% of the mutantcells displayed HipHop on multiple telomeres. Therefore, the
presence of HipHop at telomeres depends on ATM and MRN
functions, although there seems to be a stronger dependencein endo-replicating cells than in cycling cells, a phenomenonobserved earlier, although the cause remains undetermined.
We used western blot to investigate whether the reduced
presence of HipHop and HOAP at ATM or MRN-deﬁcient
telomeres is associated with a reduced level of the targetproteins. Although we did not observe signiﬁcant changes ofHOAP level in both mutants and of HipHop level in the atm
mutant, we did observe a signiﬁcant reduction of HipHop in
thenbsmutant (Figure 4H). This is consistent with earlier
immunostaining results showing fewer HipHop-occupiedtelomeres in mrnmutants than in atmmutants. It is possible
that inefﬁcient loading of HipHop to mrn-mutant telomeres
leads to it destabilization. However, we cannot rule out thepossibility that MRN directly regulates HipHop protein stability.
We observed essentially background staining of HipHop on
cav
1mutant chromatin in interphase (not shown), and on
mutant telomeres of polytene or mitotic chromosomes(Figures 4C and 5F). This is consistent with that HipHop
level is greatly reduced in cav1mutants (Figure 2B).

Results from immunostaining experiments clearly showed a
predominant enrichment of the HipHop–HOAP complex attelomeres, although at a limited resolution. To gain mechan-istic insights into how the two proteins fulﬁll their cappingfunctions, we investigated their binding to telomere chroma-
tin at a higher resolution using ChIP and real-time PCR to

G Gao et al
&2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 4 |2010 823measure enrichment. As loss of HipHop or HOAP leads to
telomere fusion in cycling cells, we focused our analyses onthose cells in larvae by performing ChIP on dissected tissues
of brains and imaginal discs.
The repetitive nature of the telomeric retrotransposons
makes it difﬁcult to study protein distribution in relationshipto the chromosome ends. To sidestep this problem, weestablished a model telomere that has unique sequencessuitable for designing ChIP primers, by taking advantage of
the fact that terminally deleted chromosomes are functionally
capped even in the absence of retrotransposons. We con-structed a P-element insertion, D4A, at the tip of chromosome2R, about 200 kb from the nearest natural telomere(Supplementary Figure S6). The D4A insertion carries a
mini- white reporter gene with a direction of transcription
pointing towards the centromere. This gene gives rise toeye pigmentation in an otherwise white -null background.
Next to its promoter, we placed a recognition site for therare-cutting I-SceI endonuclease from yeast (Rong and Golic,2003). When I-SceI was expressed from a heat-inducible
transgene in the germline of D4A heterozygous ﬂies, I-SceI
cutting at D4A sometimes led to the loss of the distal-most200 kb fragment, giving rise to a terminal deletion (TD) of 2R.Such a TD placed the white promoter at the very end of the
chromosome, resulting in a variegated eye pigmentation
pattern, distinct from the uniform pattern produced by the
original D4A insertion (Supplementary Figure S6B). Wenamed this TD as D4A
TD. The non-repetitive nature of the
sequences at D4ATDends allowed us to design primers
for real-time PCR that covers an 11-kb region from the
new telomere. As a control, we used samples from the
original D4A ﬂies in which mini- white has a non-telomeric
location.
For the original D4A chromosome, HipHop and HOAP
binding to the P-element and its surrounding region were atthe background level (Figure 6). For D4A
TD, we detected
highly signiﬁcant binding for both proteins within the 11-kb
region at the telomere. The binding seems very strongas we observed as much as 320-fold enrichment for HipHopand 270-fold enrichment for HOAP over their bindingto the same region on the original D4A chromosome
(Supplementary Table S2.1). In contrast, Histone H3 occu-
pancy at the D4A region did not show enrichment towardsthe telomere (Supplementary Figure S7). Therefore, HipHopand HOAP are highly enriched at the telomeric region ofD4A
TD, and cover a large duplex region of the telomere.
More importantly, this broad domain of HipHop and HOAP
binding is independent of the presence of telomeric
retrotransposons.
The HP1 protein has a ‘spreading’ behaviour that allows it
to occupy large heterochromatic domains in many differentorganisms (reviewed in Grewal and Jia, 2007). We studied its
distribution at the model telomere and discovered a large
HP1-binding domain with a distribution pattern essentiallythe same as those of HipHop and HOAP (Figure 6). Inparticular, there is a prominent reduction of HP1 binding atthe ‘0.3-kb’ position when compared with its peak of binding
at the ‘1-kb’ position. A similar reduction, but to a lesser
degree, was observed for both HipHop and HOAP. Therefore,the binding of HipHop, HOAP and HP1 are not limited to theextreme end of the telomere but cover 410 kb of the double-
stranded telomere region.Sequence-independent binding of HipHop–HOAP
to natural telomeresOur ChIP results showed that HipHop and HOAP are capableof binding to telomeres without the presence of retrotrans-posons. However, it is possible that this mode of binding isdifferent from that to the natural, transposon-capped telo-
meres in that HipHop and HOAP might have developed
higher binding afﬁnity for certain regions of the retro-elements. If that were the case, one would predict that thelevel of HipHop and HOAP binding might be proportional tothe abundance of telomeric transposons, a behaviour similar
to that of the Prod protein in Drosophila (To ¨ro¨ket al, 2007).
To test this prediction, we performed immunostaining onpolytene nuclei that have homologous chromosomes bearingdifferent amounts of telomeric transposons. In the ﬁrst case,we compared HipHop binding to D4A
TDwith its binding to
the natural end of 2R on the homologous chromosome and
discovered that the intensities of antibody signal on those

Gaiano strain in which the retrotransposon arrays on alltelomeres are several times longer than those in typical
laboratory strains (Siriaco et al, 2002). We generated ﬂies in
which all bivalents were heterozygous for a wild type and aGaiano chromosome. In polytene cells, the Gaiano chromo-
somes were visibly longer than their wild-type homologs,allowing us to directly compare HipHop binding to the two
ends bearing different levels of retrotransposons. Again, the
degrees of HipHop binding were very similar for all bivalents

pairs of D4A primers in Figure 6. ( C) A model for how HipHop and HOAP distributions differ from that of HP1 at natural telomeres. HipHop–
HOAP complexes (collectively represented by the oval) bind only to distal retro-element(s) (left-facing block arrow), whereas two classes ofHP1 molecules (diamonds) occupy the telomeric region. One associates with HipHop–HOAP. The other binds multiple retro-elements as well assubtelomeric repetitive regions (black rectangle).Interaction of HipHop with HOAP and HP1 to protect Drosophila telomeres
G Gao et al
&2010 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 4 |2010 825(Figure 7A). These results suggest that HipHop and possibly
HOAP binding to natural telomeres are not affected by theamount of telomeric transposons, but are likely sequence
independent and limited to the vicinity of the ends.
We performed ChIP to study HipHop and HOAP binding to
natural telomeres in cycling cells, using a primer pair fromthe conserved GAG region of HeT-A , the most abundant
telomeric retrotransposon in Drosophila (reviewed inPardue and Debaryshe, 2008). We observed signiﬁcant en-
richments for both HipHop and HOAP when compared with
for the non-telomeric CG32795 locus (Figure 7B, 5.19%
versus 0.22% IP/input for HipHop (a 23-fold enrichment)and 3.28% versus 0.36% for HOAP (a 9-fold enrichment)).However, these values from HeT-A primers are much lower
than the values generated with the seven D4A primers
(30.45% on average for HipHop (a 138-fold enrichment)and 10.32% on average for HOAP (a 28-fold enrichment),from Figure 6; Supplementary Table S2.1). Because of therepetitive nature of telomeric transposons, the enrichmentsderived from HeT-A primers could represent moderate
HipHop and HOAP binding to all or most HeT-A elements.
Alternatively, we favour that these moderate enrichmentsreﬂect strong protein binding to a selected few HeT-A ele-
ments but averaged over the entire transposon array as thePCR primers would anneal to all HeT-A elements, but only
some of which bind HipHop and HOAP (see the model in
Figure 7C). We suggest that these HeT-A elements that
HipHop–HOAP binds are at the very ends of the chromo-somes as supported by our earlier immunostaining results(Figure 7A).
HP1 was also enriched at telomeric HeT-A elements
(Figure 7B), but it behaves differently from either HipHopor HOAP. The ‘% IP over input’ value for HP1 derived fromtheHeT-A primers was similar to the average value derived
from D4A primers (an average of 1.31% for the seven D4Aprimers versus 1.9% for HeT-A primers). This is different
from what we observed in HipHop or HOAP ChIP experi-
ments, suggesting that HP1 binding is not limited to distalmost HeT-A elements. We suggest the existence of two classes
of HP1 molecules on telomeres (see the model in Figure 7C):one associates with the HipHop–HOAP complex and serves
capping function, the other associates with multiple retro-
transposons and possibly other repetitive elements such asTAS and serves functions in transcriptional regulation assuggested earlier (Perrini et al, 2004; Frydrychova et al,
2008). Kanoh et al(2005) reported strikingly similar distribu-
tion patterns of the Swi6 protein (HP1 homolog) and the Taz1
capping protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe as those of
Drosophila HP1 and HipHop–HOAP.
Discussion
In this study, we identiﬁed the HipHop protein as a novelcomponent of a Drosophila capping complex. HipHop loca-lizes to all telomeres in both proliferating and endo-replicat-ing cells. Loss of HipHop leads to one of the strongest
uncapping defect observed so far.
We identiﬁed HipHop based on its ability to associate with
HOAP through biochemical puriﬁcation. Such an approachcould be useful for future studies in Drosophila telomerebiology as similar ones have been very productive in other
systems (Liu et al, 2004; Miyoshi et al, 2008). Our bio-chemical approach was aided by our ability to epitope-tag
the endogenous cavlocus, eliminating potential artifacts
associated with the overproduction of bait proteins. With
the recent development of the SIRT targeting method in
Drosophila (Gao et al, 2008), biochemical puriﬁcation using
endogenous tags could be efﬁciently applied in the study ofother biological processes in Drosophila.
The HipHop–HOAP complex
Several lines of evidence suggest that HipHop and HOAPlikely function as a complex. First, HipHop was abundantly
present in HOAP IPs, suggesting a strong interaction between
the two proteins (Supplementary Figure S2). Second, bacteriaexpressed HipHop was able to interact with HOAP in ﬂyextracts (Figure 1). Third, the changes of HOAP and HipHoplevels showed inter-dependency (Figure 2). Fourth, the load-
ing of both HipHop and HOAP to telomeres was under the
same genetic controls of MRN and ATM (Figures 4 and 5).Finally, the two proteins had very similar distribution pat-terns on our model telomere and co-localized precisely inimmunostaining experiments (Figures 5 and 6). On the basis
of some of the same criteria, HP1 is likely to be a part of the
complex. The Modigliani(Moi)/DTL protein was recentlyidentiﬁed as another capping protein that is enriched attelomeres and interacts with both HOAP and HP1 (Komonyiet al, 2009; Raffa et al, 2009). We did not detect Moi/DTL
peptides in HOAP IPs.
HipHop–HOAP is part of the telomeric chromatin
The model telomere D4A
TDhas allowed us an unprecedented
view of the chromatin landscape in the vicinity of aDrosophila telomere. We located HipHop, HOAP and HP1essentially at the very end of a chromosome, strengthen-ing earlier results from immunolocalization experiments.
Remarkably, HipHop, HOAP and HP1 seem to bind to a
much larger region than the immediate vicinity of the chro-mosome end. We envision one possible mechanism thatcould lead to such a binding pattern. After the initial recruit-ment of the HipHop–HOAP complex to the chromosome end,they ‘spread’ internally to cover a larger region. It is tempting
to speculate that this ‘spreading’ might be mediated by HP1
as we observed a binding pattern of HP1 essentially identicalto those of HipHop and HOAP on D4A
TD. However, results
from ChIP experiments using HeT-A primers suggest that HP1
occupies a larger region than HipHop or HOAP on trans-
poson-capped telomeres (Figure 7B and C), which implies
that the mere presence of HP1 on chromatin is not sufﬁcientfor HipHop or HOAP binding. In addition, HOAP can belocalized to telomeres in su(var)205/hp1 mutants (Cenci
et al, 2003), suggesting that HP1 is not necessary for HOAP
and possibly HipHop binding to telomeres. Whether HP1
affects the extent of HipHop–HOAP spreading requires ChIPlocalization of HipHop and HOAP on our model telomere in asu(var)205 mutant background.
We suggest that the binding patterns of HipHop and HOAP
on our model telomere is a qualitative reﬂection of their
patterns on natural telomeres, as we observed very similar
binding intensity of HipHop on D4A
TDversus its homologous
telomere in immunostaining experiments. Similar observa-tions were documented for HP1 on polytene and HOAP onmitotic telomeres using TDs (Fanti et al, 1998; Cenci et al,
2003).Interaction of HipHop with HOAP and HP1 to protect Drosophila telomeres
GG a o et al
The EMBO Journal VOL 29 |NO 4 |2010 &2010 European Molecular Biology Organization 826Potential functional homologs of HipHop and HOAP
in other organismsHipHop and HOAP share functional characteristics with cap-
ping proteins in other eukaryotes. First, they bind to the
double-stranded region of the telomere in vivo . Second, they
occupy a large domain on telomeric chromatin. Third, theyare continuously present at the telomeres. Finally, the loss ofthese proteins leads to frequent telomere fusions. We suggestthat HipHop and HOAP behave similarly and might serve
similar functions as the Rap1 protein in S. cerevisiae , Taz1 in
S. pombe , and TRF2 in mammals. Further dissection of
HipHop and HOAP’s molecule function would be needed toconﬁrm our proposition.
The telomere loading of HipHop and HOAP is under the
control of ATM and MRN. The same set of proteins mediate
the loading of various telomeric factors including telomeraseactivity, and the Cdc13 capping protein in yeast (Diede andGottschling, 2001; Goudsouzian et al, 2006; Negrini et al,
2007). This high degree of functional conservation suggestthat it is unlikely that these factors directly act on capping
proteins, which are generally divergent at the sequence level.
It is more likely that these proteins modulate a commonDNA/chromatin structure at telomeres of eukaryotic cells.One conceivable candidate for this ‘universal’ structure is theterminal 3
0overhang (reviewed in Lydall, 2009). The reduced
occupancy of HipHop, HOAP and HP1 at the extreme end of
our model telomere (Figure 6), suggests that Drosophilachromosomes might also terminate as a 3
0overhang.
HipHop and HOAP are representatives of fast-evolving
telomeric proteins
HipHop and HOAP seem to evolve faster than typical pro-
teins. An interesting proposition is that this faster rate ofevolution is driven by the fast-evolving telomeric retrotrans-posons (Villasante et al, 2008), to which the HipHop–HOAP
complex binds. HOAP was implicated in binding DNA
(Shareef et al, 2001). Whether HipHop is capable of binding
DNA directly is currently under investigation. Under thelimited resolution of immunostaining, we did not detectany change in HipHop–HOAP binding efﬁciency to telomereswith different levels of retrotransposons (Figure 7). Nor did
we or others observe any phenotypic effects of having a
‘retrotransposon-free’ telomere. Although TDs can be efﬁ-ciently maintained under laboratory conditions, it remainsundetermined whether there is any ﬁtness cost for animalswith a TD irrespective of the loss of essential genes.Therefore, further studies are required to identify the driving
force for the fast evolution of HipHop and HOAP.
Interestingly, telomeric proteins from other systems are
generally less conserved at the sequence level and show signsof fast evolution (Li et al, 2000; Martı ´net al, 2007; Shakirov
et al, 2009). Further investigation into the functional relation-
ship between HipHop–HOAP and the telomeric retrotrans-
posons in Drosophila might reveal the signiﬁcance for thisfast evolution of telomeric proteins in general.

Antibodies
A guinea pig (GP) HOAP antibody was raised against the full-lengthprotein as described earlier (Shareef et al, 2001). The antibody was
used at 1:1000 for western blot analyses, and 1:100 in immuno-
staining experiments. It was also used in ChIP.
Rabbit and GP anti-HipHop antibodies were raised against an
antigen consisting of residues 72–175 of HipHop, and afﬁnitypuriﬁed using the same antigen. The coding region for this antigenwas ampliﬁed with primer pair: FP6874 and RP6874 and cloned
into the BamHI and XhoI sites in the pGEX-6p-1 vector. The GST-
fusion protein was puriﬁed and the GST tag removed as per themanufacturer’s (Novagen) instructions. The serum was used at1:2000 for western blot analyses and 1:200 in immunostainingexperiments. The GP antibody was used in ChIP.
A rabbit anti-HP1 antibody from Covance and a rabbit anti-
Histone H3 from Abcam were used in ChIP.
GST-fusion proteins and GST pull-down assays
The GST-fusion proteins described in Figure 1B were expressedfrom the pGEX-6P-1 vector with coding regions of the differentfragments cloned between BamHI and XhoI sites. The codingregions for ‘221’ was ampliﬁed with primers F-6874ﬂ and R-6874ﬂ;‘N99’ with primers F-TCP001 and R-TCP099; ‘C125’ with F-TCP096
and R-TCP221; ‘C80’ with F-TCP140 and R-TCP221; M102 with
FP6874 and RP6874. For the DM construct, the ‘221’ plasmid
containing GST fused to full-length HipHop was used as a templatein PCR using 5
0phosphorylated primers pF-TCP141 and pR-TCP100.
The PCR products were self-ligated generating a plasmid with aninternal deletion of HipHop, which was veriﬁed by sequencing.
GST pull-down assays were performed using standard protocols.
Brieﬂy, puriﬁed GST-fusion proteins were incubated at 4 1C for 1 h
with 1 ml of chromatin extracts from myc-tagged embryos inbinding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mMMgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1% NP-40, 20%glycerol and 100 mg/ml BSA supplemented with protease inhibitors
from Roche). About 20 ml of glutathione agarose beads were added
and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 1C. The beads were
washed ﬁve times each with 1 ml of binding buffer. The boundproteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and resolved bySDS–PAGE for western blot analyses.
RNAi-mediated knockdown of HipHop and HOAP in S2 cells
To produce dsRNA for RNAi, individual DNA fragments either 200or 500 bp in length, containing sequences from the coding regions
for the proteins to be knocked down were ampliﬁed by PCR. For
hiphop , two pairs of primers were used: dHiphopT7F with
dHiphopT7220R and dHiphopT7F70 with dHiphopT7520R. Forhoap, two primer pairs were used: dHoapT7F with dHoapT7220R
and dHoapT7F with dHoapT7525R. For the gfpcontrol, the primers
T7-EGFP-F and T7-EGFP-R were used. Each primer contains a
sequence for the T7 promoter followed by sequences speciﬁc for the
targeted genes. Single-stranded RNAs were synthesized frompuriﬁed PCR products by in vitro transcription using the MEGA-
script RNAi kit (Ambion). To promote dsRNA formation, RNAmixtures were ﬁrst denatured at 90 1C for 1 min, then re-annealed by
slow cooling to room temperature.
RNAi experiments were performed as described earlier (Rogers
and Rogers, 2008) with slight modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, S2 cells at
about 2.0 /C210
6cells/ml were diluted 1:1 in culture medium and
cultured for 16–20 h. Cells were transfected with dsRNAs usingEffectene reagents from Qiagen. Four days after transfection, cellswere washed in PBS, diluted 1:1 with culture medium andtransfected again as above. The transfected cells were incubated
for an additional 4 days at 24 1C, and then processed for cytology or
western blot analyses.

orthologous amino-acid sequences were created (Supplementary

Cytology
Immunostaining on larval polytene and larval neuroblasts wereperformed as described in Fanti et al(1998) and Cenci et al(2003),
respectively. Using the AxioVision software from Zeiss, thefollowing procedure was used to quantify ﬂuorescent intensityfrom antibody-stained polytene telomeres (Figure 7). For a
particular pair of homologous telomeres, the average ﬂuorescent
intensity (AF
telomere) and the total area (TAtelomere) for each
telomeric region were determined as well as the average ﬂuorescentintensity from a non-telomeric region on the same chromosome(AF
background). A ﬂuorescence index (FI) was calculated for each
telomere using the formula: FI ¼(AFtelomere/C0AFbackground)/C2
TAtelomere. The ratios between FI values from multiple pairs of
homologous telomeres were averaged and plotted in Figure 7A.
DAPI staining on mitotic chromosomes from RNAi-treated cells
was performed as described (Somma et al , 2008) with slight
modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, S2 cells were ﬁrst treated with 0.4 mg/ml of
colchicine for 2 h. Cells were centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. for 3 min.Pelleted cells were washed in PBS, spun down and re-suspended in
1 ml of 0.5 M sodium citrate for 10 min. Cells were spun down, ﬁxed
in 1 ml of ﬁxative solution (methanol:acetic acid ¼3:1) for 10 min,
spun down brieﬂy and re-suspended in a small volume of theﬁxative solution. Cells were dropped onto a microscope slide, whichwas ﬁrst air dried and then mounted in a DAPI-containing medium
from Vector laboratories.

ﬁxed for 20 min in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with100% cold methanol for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS twiceand centrifuged onto a micro slide from VWR (1500 r.p.m. for3 min). Slides were frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for
immunostaining as slides prepared from larval neuroblasts.

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is defined by the predominant deposition of IgA in the glomerular mesangium. Light microscopic appearances and clinical features can vary considerably, reflecting the many patterns of histopathologic injury seen in this glomerulonephritis (GN) Closely associated with IgAN is Henoch-Scho[Combining Diaeresis]nlein purpura (HSP), a small-vessel systemic vasculitis characterized by small blood vessel deposition of IgA predominantly affecting the skin, joints, gut, and kidney. The nephritis of HSP is also characterized by mesangial IgA deposition and may be histologically indistinguishable from IgAN. Both clinical and laboratory evidence support a close relationship between IgAN and the nephritis of HSP (1). This article focuses on IgAN considering especially new information available since IgAN was last reviewed in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2). In particular, we focus on our growing understanding of the pathogenesis of IgAN, and we discuss the impact of recently published randomized, controlled trials (RCT) on recommended treatment strategies.
Epidemiology and Clinical Features
The clinical course of IgAN is well established and has recently been reviewed elsewhere (3). There are a number of clinical features for which there is no certain explanation; these include the male preponderance, the apparent peak incidence in the second and third decades of life, the very wide range of presenting clinical features, and the variable tempo of disease after diagnosis. Data from Japan suggest that the prevalence of subclinical “lanthanic” IgAN may be even higher than already suspected, on the basis of renal biopsies in living kidney donors, in which 16% were found to have previously unknown mesangial IgA (4). The geographic differences in apparent prevalence of IgAN—higher in the Pacific Rim, where incidence in older patients is reported to be increasing, and Southern Europe, as opposed to northern Europe and North America—are still the subject of debate. Varying approaches to the use of renal biopsy in patients with mild urinary abnormalities are often cited as one explanation, but worldwide practice is becoming increasingly uniform, and fewer nephrologists now recommend renal biopsy for people with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in the absence of sustained proteinuria. Most prevalence data are generated from centers in major industrialized cities in which the lifestyle is becoming increasingly uniform, suggesting that the varied incidence more likely represents true differences among racial groups, rather than environmental in origin. However, genetic studies have so far been unrewarding in defining the pathogenesis of IgAN.
The diagnosis of IgAN always requires renal biopsy. No clinical presentation is pathognomonic, not even the archetypal young male patient with episodic macroscopic hematuria after an upper respiratory tract infection, which is the presenting feature in 30 to 40% of cases. Most patients have only a few episodes of frank hematuria, and such episodes usually recur for a few years at most.
Asymptomatic urine testing identifies 30 to 40% of patients with IgAN in most series. Studies in which renal biopsy has been offered to patients with isolated microscopic hematuria suggest that up to half of such patients in all age groups will have IgAN, with the majority of the remaining patients having either thin-membrane nephropathy or normal biopsies (5,6). It is very rare for proteinuria to occur without microscopic hematuria in IgAN. Nephrotic syndrome is uncommon, occurring in only 5% of all patients with IgAN, but is more common in children and adolescents. Patients may develop nephrotic-range proteinuria at different stages of the disease, both when there is mild glomerular injury and when there is advanced glomerulosclerosis.
Acute renal failure is very uncommon (<5% of all cases) and develops by two distinct mechanisms. There may be acute, severe immune and inflammatory injury producing crescent formation: Crescentic IgAN—this may be the first presentation of the disease or can occur superimposed on known milder IgAN. Alternatively, acute renal failure can occasionally occur with mild glomerular injury when heavy glomerular hematuria leads to tubular occlusion and/or damage by red cells. This is a reversible phenomenon, and recovery of renal function occurs with supportive measures.
The remainder of patients with IgAN, typically older at presentation, already have proteinuria, renal impairment, and hypertension when they first receive the diagnosis. Rarely, IgAN may present with malignant hypertension. It is usually presumed that they have longstanding IgAN that was not detected earlier because the patient did not have frank hematuria or undergo routine urinalysis.
Pathology
The range of pathologic features of IgAN is well described (7). Mesangial IgA deposits are the defining hallmark of the disease; they are diffuse and global, even if light microscopic change is focal or segmental. IgA deposits are also occasionally seen in glomerular capillary walls, where their presence has been associated with a worse prognosis. IgA is the sole Ig present in only 15% of biopsies; IgG and IgM accompany IgA in the majority of cases. C3 deposition is usual and has the same distribution as IgA.
Light microscopic abnormalities may be minimal, but the most common appearance is mesangial hypercellularity. This most commonly is diffuse and global, but focal segmental hypercellularity is also seen. With progressive disease, there is relentless accumulation of mesangial matrix. Crescentic change may be superimposed on diffuse mesangial proliferative GN with or without associated segmental necrosis. Crescents are a common finding in biopsies that are performed during episodes of macroscopic hematuria with renal impairment. Tubulointerstitial changes do not differ from those seen in other forms of progressive GN, reflecting the final common pathway of renal parenchymal disease.
Mesangial and paramesangial electron dense deposits are the ultrastructural manifestation of mesangial IgA deposition. There is evidence that a proportion of patients with IgAN have diffuse uniform global thinning of the glomerular basement membrane indistinguishable from that seen in thin-membrane nephropathy. It is not yet clear whether this group of patients has any defining clinical or prognostic characteristics compared with typical cases of IgAN (8,9).
A number of classifications of IgAN based on light microscopic findings are in use, for example those of Lee and Haas (10–12), but there is little agreement about their relative utility. An international consensus on a pathologic classification for IgAN would be of great value in clinical practice and research in this field; the International IgA Nephropathy Network with the Renal Pathology Society, under the auspices of the International Society of Nephrology, are presently developing such a consensus, which it is expected will be announced in 2006.
Do these various clinical presentations and pathologic features of IgAN all arise from the same disease process? It is common to describe IgAN as a single disease, but our present limited understanding of the cause and pathogenesis of IgAN does not yet provide strong support for such a view. Mesangial IgA deposition and subsequent injury may eventually turn out to represent a final common path of glomerular response to a wide range of causative and pathogenic processes, and a very different classification may emerge in due course.
Pathogenesis
The initiating event in the pathogenesis of IgAN is the mesangial deposition of IgA, which is predominantly polymeric IgA of the IgA1 subclass (pIgA1). Co-deposits of IgG and complement are also commonly seen; however, these are not mandatory for disease activity or progression. The varied glomerular response to IgA deposition is reflected in the renal biopsy findings, clinical presentation, and outcome of patients with IgAN. Three key elements contribute to the development of IgAN, and the extent to which each is operational decides the severity, tempo, and eventual outcome of IgAN in any individual:
Synthesis, release, and persistence in the circulation of pIgA1 with characteristics that favor mesangial deposition;
The “reactivity” of the glomerular mesangium as judged by:
its susceptibility to mesangial deposition
its capacity to mount an inflammatory response to that deposition;
The tendency of the kidney to respond to injury by mounting a response that favors progressive renal injury rather than resolution of inflammation without ongoing glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.
The likely interactions of these elements of pathogenesis are shown in Figure 1. Each of these three elements may have a significant genetic component that influences the eventual phenotype of the disease in any individual.
Although mesangial IgA deposition and the initiation by IgA of glomerular inflammation are specific to IgAN, mechanisms of the subsequent renal injury followed either by resolution or progressive sclerosis are likely to be generic, not differing substantially from those seen in other forms of chronic GN. In this review, we focus on IgA-specific pathogenic mechanisms.
IgA and IgA Production in IgAN
A number of abnormalities in circulating IgA and its production are reported in IgAN (13). However, patient cohorts are heterogeneous with respect to these abnormalities, supporting the notion that more than one pathogenic mechanism may result in the production of pathogenic circulating IgA. An increased plasma IgA level is not sufficient per se to produce mesangial IgA deposits; therefore, patients with IgAN must produce a pool of circulating IgA molecules with special characteristics that particularly promote mesangial deposition.
Molecular Characteristics of IgA in IgAN.
There is no well-supported evidence that IgAN is driven by circulating IgA autoantibodies’ binding to glomerular antigens. Increases in circulating IgA1 antibodies against a variety of antigens have certainly been described, but no single pathogenic antigen has been identified. Studies of serum IgA have by contrast demonstrated a number of unusual physical characteristics in IgAN (Table 1). Although some of these findings have been replicated for IgA eluted from renal biopsy specimens, it is not yet certain which of these features are responsible for the mesangial deposition and mesangial cell (MC) activation of IgAN.
Abnormal O-glycosylation of IgA1 in IgAN has been widely investigated, and there is now increasing evidence for its involvement in the pathogenesis of IgAN (14). The abnormality takes the form of reduced galactosylation of the IgA1 hinge region O-glycans, leading to increased frequency of truncated O-glycans. Altered sialylation of the IgA1 O-glycans in IgAN is more contentious, with increased and decreased O-sialylation being reported. Early reports were confined to studies of serum IgA, but two studies of IgA1 eluted from isolated glomeruli have now identified the same O-glycosylation abnormalities in mesangial IgA1, strongly implicating altered glycosylation in the mechanisms of IgA deposition (15,16). The functional effects of altered IgA1 hinge region O-glycosylation are under active investigation. Current in vitro evidence suggests that aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 molecules have an increased tendency both to self-aggregate and to form antigen-antibody complexes with IgG antibodies directed against IgA1 hinge epitopes, favoring the generation of macromolecular aggregates of pIgA1 and IgA immune complexes (IgA-IC), which would promote mesangial deposition (17,18). In addition, IgA1 molecules that lack terminal sialic acid and galactose units have increased in vitro affinity for the extracellular matrix components fibronectin and type IV collagen (18). Early studies in this field have relied on in vitro deglycosylation of IgA1, which produces a much more extensive alteration in glycosylation than the subtle abnormalities identified in serum and mesangial IgA1 in patients, so there is some uncertainty about the extrapolation of these findings to the human disease. In vitro studies using serum IgA1 isolated from patients with IgAN are now emerging and seem more likely to produce clinically relevant information (19).
A functional abnormality of the specific glycosyltransferases responsible for the O-glycosylation of IgA1 has been proposed as a mechanism for altered O-glycosylation in IgAN (20). β-1,3-Galactosyltransferase (β1,3-GT) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the addition of galactose to O-linked glycans, and although we reported some evidence for a functional defect in β1,3-GT in peripheral blood B cells (21), we have since found no overt defect in the activity of this enzyme in bone marrow B cells in IgAN (22). These studies have been hampered for some years by lack of information on the molecular genetics of glycosyltransferases; however, such work is now possible as the core β1,3-GT and its molecular chaperone, Cosmc, have now been characterized (23,24).
IgA Production in IgAN.
The site of production of the pathogenic IgA in IgAN has been an area of extensive study. The association of episodic macroscopic hematuria with mucosal infections originally led to the suspicion that IgAN was intimately linked with abnormal mucosal antigen handling, particularly because both mesangial IgA and the increased IgA fraction in serum IgA are polymeric, which is normally produced at mucosal surfaces rather than in systemic immune sites. However, studies that were published several years ago indicate that the presence of pIgA in the circulation cannot be attributed simply to mucosal overproduction and “spillage” into the circulation. These studies indicated that mucosal pIgA plasma cell numbers are normal or even reduced in IgAN, whereas pIgA antibody levels in mucosal secretions are not elevated and are sometimes lower than controls. However, increased pIgA1 plasma cell numbers are found in the bone marrow in IgAN, and systemic antigen challenge results in increased titers of circulating pIgA1 antibodies, with normal levels in mucosal secretions. Therefore, the overproduction of pIgA1 is likely to be based within systemic immune sites such as the bone marrow, with both systemic and mucosal antigen challenges resulting in aberrant systemic immune responses (13). The origin of the plasma cells that secrete this pIgA1 remains a matter for debate. One possibility is that they are displaced mucosally derived plasma cells that have taken up residence in systemic sites rather than back home to their mucosal site of origin; this requires further investigation. γδ T cells are a minority T cell population that play a role in mucosal immunity and promote IgA production. Abnormal patterns of V (variable) region usage by γδ T cells have been reported in both the mucosa and the marrow in patients with IgAN (25,26), although the functional implications of these findings have not yet been elucidated.
Little yet is known of specific mechanisms that may control IgA synthesis in the different immune sites. There is emerging evidence that in health, the degree of IgA O-glycosylation can vary between immune sites possibly through local differences in β1,3-GT activity. Rather than a generalized β1,3-GT defect being the explanation for altered O-glycosylation of serum IgA1, it may be that undergalactosylated pIgA1 is a normal glycoform of IgA in some immune sites, such as the mucosa, the excess of this IgA glycoform in the serum in IgAN being a consequence of misplaced mucosally derived plasma cells’ secreting mucosal-type IgA into the circulation. Whatever the reason for the altered serum IgA1 glycosylation, the effect is that the mesangium is exposed to undergalactosylated IgA glycoforms that would not normally require handling by mesangial clearance pathways. Ineffective processing of such IgA as a result of its unusual glycosylation may drive the IgA accumulation and mesangial activation characteristic of IgAN.
Systemic IgA Clearance in IgAN.
Failure of normal IgA and IgA immune complex clearance mechanisms will facilitate their persistence in the serum. In vivo studies that have tracked the clearance of radiolabeled IgA from the circulation indicate a key role for the liver, with reduced liver clearance in IgAN (27). An alternative route for IgA catabolism is through the Fc receptor for IgA, CD89 (FcαRI), which mediates IgA endocytosis and catabolism (28). In IgAN, CD89 expression is downregulated on myeloid cells, which may lead to reduced clearance of IgA from the circulation and contribute to increased serum IgA levels (29). It has also been shown that IgA binds less well to CD89 in IgAN, and this may act to disrupt further the efficiency of systemic IgA clearance in IgAN (29,30).
IgA and the Mesangium
Not all mesangial IgA deposition is associated with the development of glomerular inflammation; neither is IgA deposition necessarily irreversible: Mesangial IgA deposits disappear when kidneys with subclinical IgAN are inadvertently transplanted into recipients who originally did not have IgAN, whereas sequential biopsy studies suggest that clinical remission is accompanied by disappearance of IgA deposits (31,32). In IgAN, mesangial IgA accumulation occurs because the rate of IgA deposition exceeds this clearance capacity and/or the deposited IgA is in some way resistant to mesangial clearance.
Mesangial IgA Deposition.
In animal models, macromolecular immunoglobulins are particularly prone to mesangial deposition. It seems probable that the increased levels of serum IgA macromolecules in IgAN promote mesangial deposition through nonspecific size-dependent mesangial trapping, perhaps enhanced by the O-glycosylation defect. There is also evidence from transgenic mice that soluble CD89-IgA complexes that are generated after binding of IgA to membrane-bound CD89 are associated with massive mesangial IgA deposition (33). This has led to the suggestion that CD89-IgA complexes may form part of the circulating pool of macromolecular IgA in human IgAN, although other data suggest that CD89-IgA complexes may not be specific to IgAN (34).
As well as passive trapping, there is evidence that IgA deposition may be influenced by interactions between IgA and specific mesangial matrix components. IgA1 glycosylation seems to influence matrix interactions, whereas the anionic pI of mesangial IgA may also promote interactions with mesangial matrix proteins.
Mesangial IgA Clearance and IgA Receptors.
The principal candidate pathway for IgA clearance is through MC receptor–mediated endocytosis and catabolism of IgA deposits. The precise nature of the MC IgA receptor(s) remains controversial. The transferrin receptor (CD71) is expressed by human MC in culture, it binds IgA, and aberrantly glycosylated pIgA1 may preferentially bind to it (35,36). There is one report of increased mesangial CD71 expression in IgAN, although this is not supported by another study (37,38). There is also preliminary evidence that human MC may in addition express a novel FcαR, an asialoglycoprotein receptor, and an Fc α/μ receptor (39–41). Regardless of which receptor is involved, there is in vitro evidence that human MC are capable of receptor-mediated endocytosis and catabolism of IgA (42). It is possible that impaired binding could lead to defective mesangial IgA clearance and thereby contribute to IgA accumulation and the development of GN, although as yet there is no direct evidence for this in humans.
Development of Glomerular Injury.
IgAN is not generally associated with a marked cellular infiltrate into glomeruli, suggesting that most of the glomerular injury is mediated by an expansion in resident glomerular cells. Although IgG and complement components are often co-deposited, IgA alone seems to be sufficient to provoke glomerular injury in the susceptible individual. This occurs predominantly through IgA-induced activation of MC and local complement activation.
MC Activation.
There is strong in vitro evidence that cross-linking of MC IgA receptors with macromolecular IgA elicits a proinflammatory and profibrotic phenotypic transformation in MC (13). Consistent with the mesangial hypercellularity seen in renal biopsy specimens, MC proliferate in response to IgA. Furthermore, exposure to IgA has been shown to upregulate secretion of both extracellular matrix components, the profibrotic growth factor TGF-β, and components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). IgA is also capable of altering MC–matrix interactions by modulating integrin expression, and this may have an important role in remodeling of the mesangium after glomerular injury. Exposure of MC to IgA is also capable of initiating a proinflammatory cascade involving MC secretion of platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF); the release of the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1, IL-8, IP-10; and development of an amplifying proinflammatory loop involving IL-6–and TNF-α–induced upregulation of MC IgA receptors. There is also evidence that MC activation by co-deposited IgG may synergistically contribute to the development of a proinflammatory MC phenotype and thereby influence the degree of glomerular injury.
It is not yet clear which specific physicochemical properties of mesangial IgA affect MC activation; however, there is some in vitro evidence that undergalactosylated IgA glycoforms from patients with IgAN can both increase and reduce MC proliferation rates, increase nitric oxide synthesis and the rate of apoptosis, and enhance integrin synthesis in cultured MC (14). This together with the overrepresentation of aberrantly glycosylated IgA in mesangial IgA suggest that IgA1 O-glycosylation plays a role in both the deposition of IgA and the subsequent injury.
Complement Activation.
Although involvement of the complement cascade is not essential for the development of IgAN, there is evidence that local complement activation can influence the extent of glomerular injury. Mesangial IgA activation of C3 probably occurs through the mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathway, and this ultimately leads to the generation of C5b-9, sublytic concentrations of which can activate MC to produce inflammatory mediators as well as matrix proteins (43). C3 and MBL not only are deposited in the kidney in IgAN but also can be synthesized locally by the MC and, in the case of C3, by podocytes as well. It is likely, therefore, that having bound IgA, MC are capable of local complement activation using endogenously generated C3 and MBL, independent of any systemic complement activity. The contribution of this in situ complement synthesis and activation to progressive glomerular injury is not known. MC also synthesize complement regulatory proteins, which may explain why C5b-9 generation in IgAN does not usually result in mesangiolysis.
Genetics of IgAN
There is little doubt that there are genetic components to the pathogenesis and clinical expression of IgAN. This has been inferred from the existence of familial forms of IgAN, the presence of elevated serum IgA levels and overproduction of IgA by cultured B cells in otherwise unaffected family members, and the failure of exposure to mesangial IgA deposits to lead to IgAN in all individuals. Most population studies in IgAN to date have been relatively small case-control genetic association studies that have examined single-nucleotide polymorphisms in single candidate genes. The lack of concordance across many of these studies reflects both small sample sizes and the methodologic limitations of using such a strategy in studying a complex polygenic disease. This is compounded by uncertainty as to whether IgAN is truly a single entity and the realization that IgAN may exist as a subclinical condition in apparently normal control populations. Furthermore, many of the published studies have reported on genetic factors that influence progression of renal failure in IgAN (likely generic to many chronic kidney diseases) rather than on disease pathogenesis (44).
Genome-wide linkage analysis in 30 multiplex kindreds has demonstrated linkage of IgAN to 6q22–23 (45). There are no obvious candidate genes within the linked interval, and no linkage was found in the same kindreds for a number of other candidate genes that all have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Further definition of the genes involved within the IGAN1 locus is still awaited. It is not certain that genetic findings from these unusual multiplex families will have direct bearing on more typical sporadic cases of IgAN.
Natural History and Prognosis
Fewer than 10% of all patients with IgAN have complete resolution of urinary abnormalities. IgAN has the potential for slowly progressive chronic renal impairment, leading eventually to ESRD. Approximately 25 to 30% of any published cohort will require renal replacement therapy within 20 to 25 years of presentation. From first symptoms, 1.5% of patients with IgAN have been calculated to reach ESRD per year. The perceived overall cohort risk of course will be influenced by the diagnostic approach, because centers with a low threshold for renal biopsy for patients with mild urine abnormality will likely diagnose IgAN in a larger number of patients with mild disease and good prognosis, thus favorably influencing the overall outcome of the cohort.
Many studies have identified features at presentation that mark a poor prognosis (Table 2). Although these prognostic features may be informative for populations of patients, they as yet do not have the specificity to identify an individual prognosis with complete confidence. An approach that incorporates sequential information on BP and proteinuria can refine further the prediction of progression risk (46–48), although this still will only account for 30% of overall risk (44). In milder disease, one study suggested that proteinuria may in fact be a less powerful predictive factor than expected (49). Although prognostic formulas that use simple clinical and laboratory data have been proposed (44,49), there is not yet sufficient consensus to recommend that they be used in clinical practice for the prediction of individual progression risk. It remains uncertain whether pathologic classification adds predictive power in the individual patient; progress in defining the answer has been limited by the lack of international consensus on pathologic classification of IgAN.
Recurrence after Renal Transplantation
Recurrence of IgAN after renal transplantation has been recognized for 30 years. It is assuming increasing importance as a cause of graft failure as control of rejection improves. It typically is slowly progressive, although occasional patients will have a rapidly progressive course. Available evidence indicates at 5 yr a 5% risk for graft failure as a result of recurrence, a 13% risk for significant graft dysfunction, and at least 50% risk for IgA deposition. The risk for graft loss increases markedly to 25% when a first graft was lost to recurrence. There is no consistent evidence that these risks differ between living and cadaveric donors (50). There is no evidence that any particular immunosuppressive regimen alters the incidence of IgAN recurrence after transplantation or of the prognosis of recurrence in the short term. Because most recurrent IgAN is only very slowly progressive, it is not possible yet to ascertain whether newer immunosuppressive regimens may have a favorable long-term effect.
Treatment of IgAN
Several aspects of the treatment of IgAN remain controversial. Despite the prevalence of IgAN, published RCT are few in number, and even recent RCT are not always sufficiently powered to provide definitive information on tested interventions. Still no treatment is known to modify mesangial deposition of IgA, and available treatment options are directed mostly at downstream immune and inflammatory events that may lead on to renal scarring.
Recurrent Macroscopic Hematuria
Episodes of recurrent macroscopic hematuria are self-limiting and provoked by a range of mucosal, most commonly respiratory, infections. In a minority of patients, recurrent episodes are provoked by bacterial tonsillitis, and tonsillectomy may be advised. Although this will help to prevent episodic hematuria in the short term, the proponents of tonsillectomy argue that it also gives long-term renoprotection. Two large, retrospective studies from Japan support its efficacy, although follow-up of >10 yr is required before benefit becomes apparent, and the concomitant use of other treatment modalities makes these data difficult to interpret (51,52). An RCT of tonsillectomy in IgAN would be valuable, and such a study is now being planned in Japan.
Isolated Microscopic Hematuria and Little or No Proteinuria
The consensus remains that there is no specific treatment required for patients with isolated microscopic hematuria and little or no proteinuria, although prolonged surveillance is indicated. A threshold for proteinuria of 1 g/24 h is usually recommended to identify those who are at higher risk, although this is an arbitrary value, and the risk attributable to proteinuria is almost certainly a continuum.
Slowly Progressive IgAN
The main area of treatment controversy is for patients with IgAN who are at risk for slowly progressive renal dysfunction—typically those with hypertension, proteinuria >1 g/24 h, or reduced GFR at the time of diagnosis. Because progression is usually slow, large studies with prolonged follow-up are necessary to determine the efficacy of any therapeutic intervention with confidence, and many recently published studies are insufficiently powered to answer these questions. All such trials in IgAN use clinical entry criteria—typically the presence of hypertension, proteinuria 1 to 3 g/24 h, with variable reduction in GFR. This is in contrast, for example, to studies in lupus nephritis, in which histologic criteria usually dominate recruitment and reflect the lack of consensus on a histopathologic classification of IgAN.
In the past few years, new data have been reported on a number of interventions that are intended to slow immune and inflammatory events that are implicated in progressive IgAN, including corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate. Because of the long duration required to identify with confidence the benefit of interventions, it is inevitable that recruitment into a number of these studies goes back 10 yr or more, at a time when the generic approach to progressive glomerular disease was less well defined. The modern approach to such proteinuric patients emphasizes rigorous BP control to a target of 125/75 mmHg and comprehensive RAS blockade to minimize proteinuria (53). Increasingly vigorous BP control has been recommended in recent years for IgAN, predominantly by extrapolation from other studies of progressive proteinuric renal disease, although one small RCT in IgAN supported the additional benefit of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on progressive renal disease to achieve additional reduction in proteinuria despite equivalent BP control (54). Furthermore, the COOPERATE study provided evidence for additive renoprotection when an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is given in combination with an ACE inhibitor in nondiabetic proteinuric renal disease, additional reduction in proteinuria being achieved with no further lowering of BP; 131 patients in this large study had IgAN (55).
Corticosteroids.
A meta-analysis of six available trials of sufficient quality suggested that corticosteroid therapy may be effective in reducing proteinuria and reducing risk for ESRD, although the impact on protecting renal function is less clear (56). The large Italian study of corticosteroids now has 10 yr of follow-up with impressive benefit from treatment in reducing proteinuria and preventing ESRD (57). However, this high-dose corticosteroid regimen is regarded by many physicians as likely to carry considerable toxicity, even though none is reported by the investigators. RAS blockade was used in only a minority of patients in this study, although equally distributed among the participants, and achieved BP was not in line with current recommendations (Table 3). Another recent RCT of corticosteroids showed only a modest reduction in proteinuria with no protection of GFR (58), a difference attributed by the investigators to the lower dose of corticosteroids, but BP control was tight even though RAS blockade was not used (Table 3). This remains a controversial area, and in our view, corticosteroids should be considered only when proteinuria persists >1 g/24 h despite optimal BP control and maximum RAS blockade.
Most trials of corticosteroids in progressive IgAN exclude patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria, because many physicians regard this as an indication for corticosteroid therapy. However, the only RCT that addressed this question showed a response to corticosteroids only in patients with minimal or minor histologic abnormality on light microscopy (59). The use of corticosteroids when nephrotic syndrome complicates IgAN with histologic features other than minimal change is controversial, and we do not routinely take this approach.
Cyclophosphamide.
There is evidence in one study for the efficacy of cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine in conjunction with high-dose prednisolone that is given to patients who are at very high risk for progression (ESRD predicted in all cases within 5 yr) (60). However, these are only a small minority of patients encountered in clinical practice. Again, BP control and use of RAS blockade fell outside current recommendations (Table 3), and in our view, there is insufficient evidence to justify the use of cyclophosphamide in IgAN except in crescentic IgAN with rapidly progressive renal failure (see below).
Mycophenolate.
Two published studies gave no consistent indication of the benefit of mycophenolate (61,62), and it is noteworthy that the study that showed no benefit achieved rigorous blood control with use of an ACE inhibitor (Table 3). One preliminary report suggested a transient benefit of mycophenolate on proteinuria (63), whereas another showed no benefit of mycophenolate in more advanced disease (mean serum creatinine at entry 2.6 mg/dl) (64). The relatively small size of the studies so far available justifies further evaluation, and other studies are in progress (65). At this time, we do not recommend the use of mycophenolate.
Fish Oil.
Although the original study of fish oil that showed outstanding benefit remains impressive (66), there are still no further studies to support its role, and a meta-analysis that included other published studies did not suggest efficacy (60). The preliminary report of a more recent RCT showed no benefit of 2 yr of treatment with fish oil compared with corticosteroids and placebo (67). We do not recommend the use of fish oil.
BP and RAS Blockade.
The achieved BP in the COOPERATE study was significantly better than is reported in most of these recent RCT (Table 3). The efficacy and low adverse reaction rate suggest that combined RAS blockade with ACE inhibitor and ARB should be the “standard regimen” against which any additional therapeutic intervention be judged. As well as achieving a BP target of 125/75 mmHg in all proteinuric patients with IgAN, we recommend dual ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy when proteinuria reduction is insufficient with a single agent.
In our opinion, additional therapy with corticosteroids or other agents should be considered only when there is still sustained proteinuria >1 g/24 h despite achieving a target BP of 125/75 mmHg with full RAS blockade. In our experience, few patients fulfill these criteria, and it should be understood that corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate have not been evaluated adequately in the context of such a “standard regimen.” Data on achieved BP or RAS blockade were not available in the published meta-analysis that suggested benefit for corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, so the possibility that these were confounding factors was not evaluated (56).
It unfortunately is becoming increasingly difficult to judge the efficacy of any proposed new therapeutic interventions. The renoprotective efficacy of the “standard regimen” means that evaluation of any additional intervention will require increasingly large and prolonged RCT to prove benefit unless robust surrogate measures of outcome are developed to enable studies to be scaled down without loss of power.
Crescentic IgAN
Crescentic IgAN is an uncommon clinical presentation. There are no RCT of immunosuppressive therapy in crescentic IgAN associated with rapidly progressive renal failure, although recent observational studies are increasingly optimistic about the value of treatment with corticosteroids usually in combination with cyclophosphamide (68). Nevertheless, overall renal survival in crescentic IgAN is significantly inferior to that in other forms of crescentic GN, including systemic vasculitis and Goodpasture’s disease. Background chronicity in IgAN is a powerful negative influence, and immunosuppressive therapy in crescentic IgAN is recommended only when there is active crescentic injury without major background chronic damage. In such circumstances, we use corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide in a regimen similar to that applied in renal vasculitis, although in our view, there is insufficient evidence to justify the addition of plasma exchange.Figure 1: Interactions of major elements of pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Total circulating serum IgA is the source of mesangial IgA deposits in IgAN. The fraction of total serum IgA that has a propensity for mesangial deposition, however, is small, and the fraction that is capable of initiating glomerulonephritis (GN) is smaller still. The response of the mesangium and, in particular, the mesangial cell (MC) to the deposited IgA is critical to the development of IgAN. Without an appropriate genetic predisposition to develop IgAN, IgA deposition can be a benign process with little or no risk for triggering GN. However, given an appropriate genetic background, serum IgA responses will favor mesangial IgA deposition, and the mesangial response will take on a proinflammatory phenotype, resulting in clinically significant IgAN of varying severity. Finally, if generic progression risk factors coincide, then this will increase the likelihood of progressive renal impairment and may ultimately determine the rate of decline in renal function.Table 1: Properties of IgA in normal subjects and in IgAN: The common features of serum and mesangial IgA in IgANaTable 2: Prognostic markers at presentation in IgANTable 3: Treatment of IgAN: Achieved BP and use of RAS blockade in recent randomized, controlled trialsaPublished online ahead of print.

This study will involve the assessment of IgA glycosylation patterns, the interaction of IgA with mesangial matrix components, and the impact of altered IgA glycosylation on mesangial cell activation. Additionally, the study will explore the genetic factors influencing the synthesis, release, and persistence of pathogenic IgA1 with characteristics favoring mesangial deposition.

AbstractCytokines play a critical role in modulating the innate and adaptive immune systems. Here, we have identified from the human genomic sequence a family of three cytokines, designated interleukin 28A (IL-28A), IL-28B and IL-29, that are distantly related to type I interferons (IFNs) and the IL-10 family. We found that like type I IFNs, IL-28 and IL-29 were induced by viral infection and showed antiviral activity. However, IL-28 and IL-29 interacted with a heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor that consisted of IL-10 receptor β (IL-10Rβ) and an orphan class II receptor chain, designated IL-28Rα. This newly described cytokine family may serve as an alternative to type I IFNs in providing immunity to viral infection.

Recombinant DNA technology has, in the last decades, contri buted to a vast expansion
of the use of protein drugs as pharmaceutical agents. Howeve r, such biological drugs
can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) tha t may result in adverse
effects, including allergic reactions and compromised the rapeutic efﬁcacy. Production
of ADAs is most often associated with activation of CD4T cell responses resulting
from proteolysis of the biotherapeutic and loading of drug- speciﬁc peptides into major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on professional antigen-presenting cells.
Recently, readouts from MHC-associated peptide proteomic s (MAPPs) assays have
been shown to correlate with the presence of CD4T cell epitop es. However, the limited
sensitivity of MAPPs challenges its use as an immunogenicit y biomarker. In this work,
MAPPs data was used to construct an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model for MHC
class II antigen presentation. Using Inﬂiximab and Rituxim ab as showcase stories, the
model demonstrated an unprecedented performance for predi cting MAPPs and CD4T
cell epitopes in the context of protein-drug immunogenicit y, complementing results from
MAPPs assays and outperforming conventional prediction mo dels trained on binding
afﬁnity data.

INTRODUCTION
The advent of recombinant DNA technology in the last decades has boosted the use of protein
drugs as pharmaceutical agents. However, a major potential pro blem of these—compared to
lower molecular weight pharmaceutical counterparts—is adve rse eﬀects associated with protein
immunogenicity. Immunogenicity is generated because the d rug is recognized as non-self,
involving an unwanted activation of CD4T cells, and the form ation of anti-drug antibodies
(ADAs),potentiallyproducingahypersensitivityreactionin treatedpatients.
ProteindrugactivationofCD4Tcellsdependsontheinternal izationofthedrugintoendosomal
compartments in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), where prote olytic enzymes digest the proteinBarra et al. Protein-Drug Immunogenicity Predictor
into smaller peptides ( 1). According to speciﬁc rules, a
small proportion of those peptides are loaded into major
histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules. Then ,
stable peptide-MHC-II complexes are exported to APCs’ surface
forpresentationtoCD4Tcells,whichcaninitiate,maintain ,and
regulate immune responses, including the production of ADAs
(2). As a consequence, ﬁnely characterizing the rules of MHC-II
binding and antigen presentation is of high interest to promot e
a general understanding of T cell immunogenicity and for the
developmentofbiotherapeutics.
Each MHC-II complex has distinct peptide-binding
preferences predominantly determined by residues in the
MHC binding groove. The MHC binding groove interacts with
a stretch of 9 amino acids termed the peptide core. For every
MHC-IImolecule,afewpocketsaccommodatespeciﬁcpositions
of the peptide core with a narrow or broader speciﬁcity for
diﬀerent residues ( 3). These pockets and pocket speciﬁcities are
dependent on the class II molecule of study. MHC-II in humans
comprises three major gene pairs called HLA-DR, -DP, and
-DQ, all having an α- and a β-chain. The MHC presentation
of peptides is fundamentally determined by the amino acid
sequence of the peptide and the MHC-II alleles expressed by the
host. However, other factors, such as protein internalizati on or
peptidasecleavagesites,inﬂuenceswhichpeptidesarepresente d.
Historically, peptide-MHC binding aﬃnity (BA)
measurements have been used to characterize MHC binding
preferences ( 4), and collections of BA data have been used to
develop methods such as NetMHCII and NetMHCIIpan ( 5–8)
withtheabilitytopredictpeptidebindingtodiﬀerentMHCclass
IImolecules.However,thepredictivepowerofthesemethodsf or
CD4T cell epitopes remains limited. Recently, the introduction
of ligandome data as obtained by mass spectrometry (MS)
immunopeptidome assays ( 9) has improved MHC predictors’
performancesubstantially( 10–14).
Analyzing MS-data has allowed us to learn the rules of
MHC-II peptide presentation beyond peptide-MHC binding,
including peptide cleavage speciﬁcities. The incorporation of
such data to MHC-II models has demonstrated to improve
state-of-the-art prediction for “natural binders” ( 14). Currently,
MHC-associated peptide proteomics (MAPPs) are used to
assess the immunogenicity of protein drugs ( 15,16). However,
several factors entangle assay performance and interpretati on.
First, most of the peptides detected by MAPPs are of self-
origin, and only a small fraction of the peptides come from
the protein drug of interest. Thus, to increase the sensitivi ty
toward the given protein of interest, the amount of sample
required is very high, which can lead to aggregation of the
protein drug in vitro, changing the immune response ( 17,18).
Second, although MS sensitivity has increased over the past
years, still the comprehensive analysis of the peptide ligando me
is highly challenging, making it necessary to perform severa l
technical replicates to obtain the maximum amount of peptides
identiﬁed ( 19–21). In addition, variations in MHC alleles dictate
which peptides will be presented in a given MAPPs context,
making necessary the study of several donors with diﬀerent
alleles, representing the population of interest, to accurate ly
assess immunogenicity. Because of those reasons, learning thespeciﬁc rules of MHC-II presentation in the form of an in-
silicopredictor would constitute a deﬁnite step forward in the
development of means to assess the immunogenicity of protein
drugseﬀectively.
Recently, several publications have integrated MS data
into MHC-II predictors applying diﬀerent machine learning
approaches( 22–26).Asregularcellscanexpressupto12diﬀerent
HLAallelesincludingtheHLA-DR,-DQ,and-DPgenes,alarge
challengeofthisintegrationliesinhowtoassignligandst otheir
HLArestrictionelement.
To tackle this question, diﬀerent strategies have been
proposed. Abelin et al. ( 24) used an experimental approach
transfecting cells with modiﬁed HLA molecules able to be
independently puriﬁed with a biotin-avidin system to perform
“single allele” (SA) mass spectrometry. The peptides derived
from each are then used to train allele-speciﬁc prediction
models. The main disadvantage of this method is the limited
set of predictable MHC-II alleles. Chen et al. ( 26) used a
multimodal recurrent neural network to predict MHC class-
II ligands, integrating binding aﬃnity, mass-spectrometry data,
and RNAseq expression levels. A recurrent neural network was
trained on binding aﬃnity data only to resolve the ligand
HLA restriction. This method however did not show improved
performance over netMHCIIpan, suggesting that Deep neural
networks not necessarily outperform shallow neural network s
in MHC-II prediction. This method was further suggested
optimal for neoepitope discovery, where protein expression is
relevant, a factor that is not applicable for prediction of protei n
drug immunogenicity. Finally, MixMHC2pred from Racle et al.
(25) used a probabilistic framework to deconvolute MHC-II
peptidomics to the speciﬁc allele, and after used a method based
on scoring matrices for prediction, using a small set of releva nt
HLA-DRalleles.Noneoftheserecentmethods,however,arepa n-

We have recently developed a neural network framework,
NNAlign_MA, that is able to deconvolute mass spectrometry
data and at the same time train a predictor to learn the
binding preferences of individual MHC molecules ( 22,23,27).
In this work, we have trained an immunogenicity predictor
based on this NNAlign_MA framework integrating ligand
information obtained from in-house Inﬂiximab MAPPs assays,
and binding aﬃnity measurements to build a prediction model
for MHC-II antigen presentation. Using this model as a proxy
for immunogenicity prediction, we showcase its performance
on Inﬂiximab and Rituximab, two well-known protein drug
antibodies used to treat inﬂammatory diseases and known to
generate an unwanted immune response (10–60% according to
the analyzed disease, and how and when immunogenicity is
screened)( 28–30).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples
Donors and Alleles
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
from leukapheresis donated by seven healthy volunteers

(ethical protocol IXP-004 Belgium; Reg. Nr. B707201629385).
Monocytes were isolated by positive magnetic separation
and cultured for 5 days in DC medium supplemented
with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colon y-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Immature dendritic cells (iDC s)
were pulsed with Inﬂiximab at 50 µg/ml and further matured
with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for ∼20h. Mature DCs (mDC)
were collected, counted and washed with Dulbeco’s Phosphate
Buﬀered Saline (DPBS), and stored at −80◦C as dry pellets
withoutsupernatant.
Allele genotypes of the donors were deﬁned using Sequence-
BasedTyping(SBT)andaredetailedin SupplementaryTable1 .
Proteins and Peptides
Inﬂiximab (Inﬂectra) was acquired from HospiraR/circlecopyrt. Peptides

presenceofproteaseinhibitors(EDTA-free,Roche)and590uni ts
of nuclease (US Biologicals) for 45min at 4◦C with rotation.
The cell lysate was clariﬁed by centrifugation at 112,000g f or

Immuno-isolation of MHC II complexes. An isotype
IgG (Southern Biotech) and the pan anti-MHC II class
monoclonal antibody (L243) (BioXCell) were each coupled
to individual HiTrap NHS-activated HP columns (GE
Healthcare). The two columns were connected in series
with the Isotype IgG column ﬁrst for the immuno-isolation
process. The cleared lysate was loaded on the immuno-
isolation columns. The Isotype IgG column was removed,
and the MHC II complexes were washed with a buﬀer and
then eluted from the L243 column with 10% acetic acid. The
MHC II peptides were desalted by solid-phase extraction
using an MCX plate (Waters) into LoBind 96 well plates
(Eppendorf) and then transferred to MS plates (Abgene), and
vacuumevaporated.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis
Peptide samples were re-solubilized with 10 µL solubilization
buﬀer [96/4 (v/v) water/acetonitrile (CAN) +0.2% formic acid
+25mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine)]. 7 µL were

The full MS scan was achieved with a resolution of 70,000 with
an AGC value of 3 ×106and a maximum IT level of 30ms.
The dd-MS2 scan was performed at a resolution of 17,500 withan AGC value of 5 ×104and a maximum IT level of 60ms.
Blank runs of resolubilization-buﬀer were injected between

MS Data Processing and Peptide
Identiﬁcation
A single custom database of protein sequences relevant to
the experiment was created to include the Human proteome
(Swissprot), common general and Caprion-speciﬁc laboratory
contaminants,andInﬂiximab(Inﬂectra)sequence.
Peak alignment and extraction of intensity values of peptide
ions and corresponding MS/MS spectra were performed using
Rosetta ElucidatorTM(Rosetta Biosoftware, version 3.3). MS/MS
spectra were then exported for peptide identiﬁcation in PEAKS
Studio(BioinformaticsSolutions,version7.5).Searchpar ameters
included the custom database described above, non-tryptic,
oxidation of methionine and deamidation of asparagine as
variable modiﬁcations, and error tolerance of 15 ppm for
precursor mass and 0.025 Da for fragment ions. Data were
ﬁltered using a 2% FDR at the peptide level for database
searchresults.
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner
repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) with the dataset
identiﬁerPXD018303.
Neural Network Architecture and Datasets
Training Datasets
The NNAlign_MAC model was trained combining
multi-allele (MA), and single-allele (SA) data including
binding aﬃnity (BA) peptide measurements and mass
spectrometry(MS)data.
MA datasets included only self-protein MS eluted ligands
obtained from in-house MAPPs assays. The alleles expressed by
each donor are detailed in SupplementaryTable1 . Inﬂiximab
and Rituximab are chimeric antibodies that bear the constant
region from a human antibody. Therefore, it is expected
that some naturally presented peptides share similarities to
the protein-drug antibodies. To avoid a bias in the predictor
when evaluating the protein-drug antibodies, we have exclude d
all peptides sharing a common motif of 9 amino acids
(deﬁned by the length of an MHC-II binding core) to both
Inﬂiximab and Rituximab proteins from the training dataset.
This resulted in the removal of 262 peptide sequences from
the mass spectrometry datasets. Additionally, the data were
ﬁltered to only include peptides with lengths 13 to 21 in the
trainingdatasets.
SA data included peptides derived from BA measurements
or MS assays where cells were speciﬁcally-homozygous selecte d
or were artiﬁcially and genetically engineered to only expres s
a single HLA-DR allele. SA data was collected from previous
NetMHCIIpan publications ( 5,23), and updated with IEDB to
date01/28/2019.
Mass spectrometry data consists only of “positive” presented
peptides.Therefore,asetofnegativepeptideswasaddedtotrai n

allele-dataset, a set of random negatives were included fol lowing
a ﬂat distribution of lengths 13–21, taking 5 times the numbe r
of peptides of the most abundant peptide length on the positive
dataset. The ﬂat distribution of the negatives helps the neur al
network to learn the natural length preference of the data, wh ile
the selection of 5 times the most abundant length will generat e
a ratio of ∼1:10 positive to negatives, which we have previously
benchmarked and found optimal ( 14). Although this approach
will introduce some noise to the model, as it is possible that by
chance some random peptides will bind to the speciﬁc MHC
allele, this probability is very low and at the most will dimini sh
themodelperformance.
Five-Fold Partitioning
All the data combined (SA and MA) were clustered into 5
partitionsusingaHobohmalgorithmwithacommonmotifof9
amino acids to perform cross-validation as previously describ ed
(27). The artiﬁcial neural network architecture consists of an
ensemble of 150 independent networks varying; the seeds for
weight initialization ( 10), a diﬀerent number of hidden neurons
inthehiddenlayer(20,40,60),andthe5diﬀerentpartitionsu sed
for cross-validation. An average of the ensembles is used fo r the
ﬁnalpredictions.
NNAlign_MAC Architecture
NNAlign_MAC algorithm integrates the basis of NNAlign_MA
(22), an extension of NNAlign ( 27,31), with peptide context
information(PCI)( 14,23).
In short, NNAlign_MA ( 22) is a neural network framework
capable of taking a mixed training dataset composed of SA data
(peptides experimentally tested on a single MHC molecule) and
MA data (peptides experimentally tested in cell lines expressing
multiple MHC alleles), to fully deconvolute the speciﬁc MHC
restriction of all MA peptides, while learning the binding
speciﬁcity for all the MHCs alleles. The algorithm is trained
in two steps. In a ﬁrst step or pre-training (set-up here to 20
iterations), the neural networks are trained with SA data. A fter
these initial iterations, the model manages to learn the ﬁrs t
pattern for all MHC class II alleles. This is possible due to the
pan-speciﬁc algorithm used here (that introduces relevant MHC
amino acid positions known to participate in the interaction
with the peptide in the binding groove ( 8). Based on this initial
learning, the algorithm annotates the MA data according to th e
learnt binding rules. In a second step, those newly tagged MA
peptides, now converted into SA with a speciﬁc MHC allele
association, are included in a new training cycle of the netw ork.
Asmoredataisincluded,thebindingcoreforeachMHC-IIalle le
is revised. After each new training cycle, all the MA peptides ar e
re-annotated to SA data again. This process is iterated up to 4 00
trainingcycles,thusreﬁningtheprocessuntilconvergence (22).
The input neurons of this model were fed with: the peptide
sequence (tagged from diﬀerent experimental sources, BA or
MS); a binding aﬃnity measurement in the case of BA, or a
binary classiﬁcation (1-0) for those peptides derived from MS;
the allele information (either single or with all alleles ex pressed
by the donor-dataset for MA); and the MHC pseudo-sequence
(speciﬁc positions of the MHC protein sequence involved inthe MHC-peptide recognition). This training resulted in a pan-
speciﬁc model with the power to infer binding speciﬁcities also
fortheHLA-DRmoleculesnotincludedinthetrainingdatase ts.
Additionally, a separate set of input neurons encoded peptide
length and peptide context information (PCI) as described
elsewhere ( 14). PCI included 3 amino acids from both C and N
peptidetermini(previouslynamedpeptideﬂankingregions)and
3 amino acids both from upstream and downstream of the MS
peptideproteinsequence.
Cross-Validation Performance
After training both models (with and without PCI), the test se ts
were predicted, and an AUC 0.1 calculated for each MA-donor-
datasetandreportedin SupplementaryTable3 .
NetMHCIIpan version 3.2 ( 5) prediction algorithm was
employed in this work as a benchmark comparison to the
NNAlign_MAC model. As it was not possible to re-train
NetMHCIIpanwiththesamepartitionsusedforNNAlign_MAC
to report AUC 0.1, the following scheme was used. Each peptide
in the NNAlign_MAC test set was predicted for all the alleles
expressedbythegivendonorwithNetMHCIIpan,andthelowest
%rank score from all alleles was assigned to each peptide to
performanAUC0.1perdonor( SupplementaryTable3 ).
AUC is a common performance measure for predictive
models, which takes into account the relationship between tr ue
positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) for diﬀerent
prediction thresholds. AUC 0.1 (area under the ROC curve
integrated up to a false positive rate of 10%) is similar to AUC
butfocusesonthehighspeciﬁcityrangeoftheROCcurve.

MAPPs Proﬁles
Inﬂiximab in-house MAPPs were gathered together removing
peptide duplicates from the same donor and imposing a ﬁlter
of a minimum of 12 amino acids to be an MHC-II binder, to
build a MAPPs cohort. After ﬁltering, 73 peptides were mapped
toInﬂiximabproteinsequences,stackingthem,andcounting the
number of peptides covering each position. The proﬁles were
normalizedtohaveamaximumvalueof1.
Additional Inﬂiximab and Rituximab MAPPs peptides were

interest to be included in the prediction proﬁle. Subsequently ,
all the peptides were stacked in the protein-drug sequence and
the number of peptides overlapping each sequence position was
counted. After that, a so-called “allele promiscuity” calcu lation
was applied, capping the count per allele to a maximum of 1
per position. For example, a protein sequence position, with
10 peptides mapped to it from 3 diﬀerent alleles, will have
promiscuity of 3. After max normalization, these values refe r to

NetMHCIIpan Evaluation
To calculate NetMHCIIpan inﬂiximab binding proﬁles, binding
proﬁles were constructed for % Ranks values of 1, 2, 5, and 10
(SupplementaryFigure3 ). The performance of NetMHCIIpan
was consistently found to be very low and close to random for
all % Rank thresholds for both protein chains with only one
example (% Rank of 2, LC) demonstrating a positive correlation
to the MAPPs proﬁle. Given this, a value of %Rank of 2 was
selectedforthismethod.Afterthepeptides’selection,thepr oﬁles
and the Promiscuity Score was generated in the same way as
forNNAlign_MAC.
Performance Measures
Two types of correlations were used to compare predictions
from NNAlign_MAC, MixMHC2pred, and NetMHCIIpan to
experimental MAPPs proﬁles. First, the Spearman correlation
coeﬃcient (SCC) was used to correlate the proﬁles’ prediction s
to MAPPs per position in the protein sequence. Additionally,
scatter plots were made to conﬁrm the correlation after losin g
positional information that could bias our interpretation. T he
scatter plot correlation was measured both using SCC and
Pearson’scoeﬃcientcorrelation(PCC).
Additionalmeasures,PPVandAUC0.1,wereusedtocompare
performance across the methods in SupplementaryFigure4B .
To allow for minor inconsistencies between the predicted and
actual positive peptides, we here adapted a relaxed deﬁnition
of positives. This was done by assigning all predicted binders
(as deﬁned by the selected % Rank threshold) with a binding
core that overlapped any of the “original” MAPPs peptides as
positive. This set of peptides is termed the “expanded-core”MAPPs peptides. Next, this set of expanded-core peptides is
used to calculate AUC0.1 (area under the receiver operator
curve integrated up to a false positive rate of 10%), and PPV
values using the lowest % Rank score predictions over all
the alleles expressed by the donor as prediction values for
each of the peptides. PPV was calculated as the number of
true positive predictions from the number of “expanded-core”
MAPPs in the top N predictions, divided by N, where N is
the number of positives in the “expanded-core” MAPPs dataset
per donor. Precision and recall curves were likewise calcula ted
using the “core” scheme for each of the diﬀerent % Rank

PBMCs from 6 out of 7 donors were seeded at 2 ×106

day, IL-7 was added. On day 4, part of the medium was
changed and IL-2 and IL-7 were added. On day 7, cells were
harvested, and rested overnight at 37◦C. The next day, cells
were counted and seeded in IFN-y FluoroSpot plates (Mabtech).
Cells were re-stimulated with peptide or left unstimulated
overnight, in duplicates. On day 9, FluoroSpot plates were

NNAlign_MAC Is Able to Predict
Inﬂiximab-Associated MAPPs in a
Cohort-Based Approach
First, we sought to proﬁle the MHC class II immunopeptidome
of Inﬂiximab (as a biotherapeutic prototype) to predict the
immune response associated with it. For that purpose, we

pulsed with Inﬂiximab 7-donor monocyte-derived dendritic
cells, expressing the most common world population HLA-
DR alleles ( SupplementaryTable1 ). Next, LC-MS/MS was
performed, identifying 15,240 unique ligands. After removi ng

learning framework allowing for accurate deconvolution of
HLA-DR binding speciﬁcities and proper assignment of each
MS ligand to its likely HLA-DR restricting molecule ( 22).
Earlier work has shown this algorithm to be able to accuratel y
perform this task, and at the same time to learn the rules
for the MHC-II motifs present in the samples ( 22,23). The
algorithm used here was extended to include “peptide context
information” (PCI) from the peptide ﬂanking regions (PFRs)
on both peptide termini, and from the protein sequence
upstream and downstream the MS peptide sequence. The
introduction of PCI was previously shown to signiﬁcantly
reinforce the learning of the rules of “natural processing” i n
the model ( 14). Evaluating the predictive power of models
trained with and without PCI inclusion, conﬁrmed this earlie r

(SupplementaryTable3 ). We termed the NNAlign_MA model
includingPCI,NNAlign_MAC.
After deconvolution, each MS ligand was annotated to a
speciﬁc allele expressed in the sample assessed. As expected,
HLA-DRB1 due to the higher expression of those genes
compared to HLA-DRB3, −4 and−5 (33), was assigned
the highest proportion of ligands ( ∼90%,Figure2A ). All
the motifs obtained by NNAlign_MAC share a remarkable
overall correspondence across cell samples expressing the same
alleles, and to a lesser degree, also with the NetMHCIIpan
motifs (Figure2B ). The HLA-DRB4∗01:03 allele was shared
by two donors, and the motifs obtained by NNAlign_MAC
in these two, shared highly similar amino acid preferences
(PCC=0.924). Additionally, for some alleles, such as
HLA-DRB1∗08:01 and HLA-DRB4∗01:03, the motifs from
NetMHCIIpan and NNAlign_MAC, were however discordant
(Figure2B ). Comparing the amino acid composition of the in-
house MS data to that of MS data obtained from IEDB revealed
a high consistency between the two MS datasets (PCC =0.95)
andalowerconsistencytotheBAdata(PCC =0.83),supporting
the quality of in-house MS data, and suggesting that MS

(Figures2C,D ).
Next, all MAPPs peptides unique to inﬂiximab (73 peptides
from 7 donors) were mapped to the heavy and light chains
of the protein-drug and the count of peptides overlapping
each amino acid position in the protein sequence was used
to build a MAPPs proﬁle (normalized to have a maximum
value of 1) ( Figure3A ). Later, inﬂiximab sequences were
(in-silico) digested into overlapping 13–21mer peptides, and
the likelihood for MHC presentation predicted for each peptide
using NNAlign_MAC, MixMHC2pred, or NetMHCIIpan
for all the HLA-DR alleles present in the donor cohort
(SupplementaryTable1 ). To deﬁne a threshold deﬁning
positive predicted peptides from each of the models, HLA
binding-proﬁle analyses were performed for diﬀerent % Rank
thresholdsforeachofthemodels( SupplementaryFigures1–3 ).
Based on these analyses, a Rank threshold of 1% was selected
for NNAlign_MAC, a 0.5% MixMHC2pred, and a value of 2%
for NetMHCIIpan (detailed in Materials and Methods section,
SupplementaryFigures1 –3,4A).For each predicted HLA molecule, all the peptides with
predicted values below the selected % Rank threshold were
mapped to the Inﬂiximab heavy and light protein sequences.
Next, each position in the protein sequence was assigned a
value of 1 if it was covered by one peptide or more and
zero otherwise. Finally, these allele-speciﬁc binary peptide- maps
were stacked constructing a “promiscuity proﬁle” reﬂecting
how many diﬀerent alleles presented peptides overlapping a
given protein position (detailed in Methods) ( Figures3A,B ).
This mapping was performed for each of the three prediction
methods( SupplementaryFigures2 ,3,respectively).Comparing

Several protein regions, both in the light and heavy chain
were predicted to have MHC-II ligands by NNAlign_MAC even
though no peptides were identiﬁed in the MAPPs assays. We
hypothesized that this was due to the sensitivity limitation s
of the MAPPs assay. To inspect this conjecture, additional
Inﬂiximab MAPPs data, from 21 and 16 donors covering
the variable heavy and light chain regions of Inﬂiximab,
respectively, were collected from a previous publication ( 15).
First, we evaluated the correlation of this new MAPPs dataset
to the in-house Inﬂiximab dataset (including only the varia ble
region of the antibody) and observed in both cases a high
(though lower for the light chain compared to the heavy
chain) correlation between the two datasets (SCC =0.662and SCC =0.842 for the light and heavy chain respectively)
(Figures4A,B ). Given that no HLA-allele information was
available to us for the donors used in this study, we evaluated
the ability of NNAlign_MAC to predict the observed MAPPs
using the alleles included in our in-house cohort, which
have been selected covering the most frequent alleles in
the world population ( SupplementaryTable2 ) including only
the variable regions of the protein ( Figure4A ). Next, we
combined the two Inﬂiximab MAPPs datasets and analyzed
the correlation of the NNAlign_MAC predictions to this new

This observation suggests that the performance values of
NNAlign_MAC reported in Figure3A are lower bounds and
that—at least some of—the additional peaks predicted by
NNAlign_MAC represent regions with antigen presentation

As an additional proof of concept, we analyzed the
correlation of NNAlign_MAC predictions to rituximab,
an additional protein drug with MAPPs data collected
from the above-mentioned publication ( Figures4E,F ).
The average SCC correlation considering heavy and light
chains of both protein-drugs to the Hamze et al. ( 15)MAPPs data was 0.652 for NNAlign_MAC, showing that
the proposed method was able to predict most of the
MAPPsregions.

three categories: MAPPs regions—covering regions predicted by
NNAlign_MAC where MAPPs peptides were found ( Figure5A ,

LC_2, LC_4); and regions were the methods identiﬁed none or

In these assays, 67% (6/9) of the peptides spanning MAPPs
positive regions were positive in at least one donor (all except
for LC_5, HC_4 and HC_6, Figure5B ). Similar results were
observed for the NNAlign_MAC region peptides ( Figure5B ).
Here, both peptides (LC_2, LC_4) were positive for at least one
donor (Figure5B ). Finally, one of the peptides, HC_7, selected
from the “empty” region (yellow) was found to give a marginal
response in one of the assessed donors ( Figures5A,B ). These
ﬁndings thus demonstrate a very high correspondence between
the NNAlign_MAC predictions, the location of observed T cellepitopes, and further suggest that MAPPs potentially can miss

As a ﬁnal validation of the predictive power of the proposed
prediction method, a set of CD4T cell epitopes for Inﬂiximab
and Rituximab antibodies were collected from Hamze et al.
(15). In this study, all 15mers spanning the light and heavy

in a comparable fashion to experimental MAPPs. Analyzing
the hotspots regions in 30–45 from the light chain, or 90–105
from the heavy chain, we observe that NNAlign_MAC was able
to predict those regions while the MAPPs experiment missed
it (Figure6A ). In the Rituximab example, while both MAPPs
(SCC=0.561) and NNAlign_MA correlations (SCC =0.537)
show high and comparable performance for the light chain
(p-value=0.81, bootstrap), both approaches demonstrated very
limited predictive power over Rituximab heavy chain epitopes
(Figures6C,D ).
DISCUSSION
Here, we have constructed a predictor, NNAlign_MAC, for
MHC class II antigen presentation trained on in-house MAPPs
and data from the IEDB based on the previously developed
NNAlign_MA machine learning framework ( 22,23) integrating
context information and HLA binding promiscuity scores. The
predictor was demonstrated to vastly improve in performance
over NetMHCIIpan for the prediction of MHC antigen
presentation hotspots in protein drugs. Moreover, our ﬁndings
strongly suggest that the use of such prediction methods coul d

ligandsandTcellepitopes.One of the strengths of the NNAlign_MAC algorithm lies
in its ability to leverage information between multiple MAPPs
datasets reducing noise and boosting performance in particula r
for alleles characterized by limited data (as exempliﬁed by
the clear motifs identiﬁed in the MAPPs data for the weakly
expressed HLA-DR3, 4, 5 alleles). This combined with its
pan-speciﬁc power ( 8) makes NNAlign_MAC less sensitive
to the critical limiting issues often associated with MAPPs
assays including the requirement of a massive amount of
biological material, the need for experimental replicates and
repeated assaying over HLA diverse cohorts, and the non-
trivial task of interpreting/mapping the raw MS spectral data to
genomictemplates.
We have here demonstrated the power of NNAlign_MAC
for two protein drugs inﬂiximab and rituximab only. Further
studies covering a broader set of proteins are needed to
fully assess the gain in performance of prediction models
trained on MS data for prediction of antigen presentation
hotspots and T cell epitopes. Likewise, further studies are
needed to assess if the complementary power observed in
this study of in-silicopredictions over MAPPs for hotspots
identiﬁcation remains valid when tested on a broader set of
proteindrugs.Moreover,additionalmethodsforMHC-IIantige n

proposed ( 24–26). We showed an improved performance of

to both NetMHCIIpan ( 5) and MixMHC2pred ( 25). Other
methods have been recently published integrating MS MHC
ligand data in the training. As for the method developed
by Chen et al., MARIA ( 26), the comparison does not seem
adequate in this scenario as its predictive power depends
on the availability of protein expression levels, which makes
limited sense in the context of protein-drugs. Another metho d,
NeonMHC2 ( 24), only allows for to run max 20 predictions per
day, making it impractical to include in a benchmark. Further

Machine learning models trained on mass spectrometry data can predict MHC class II antigen presentation and T cell epitopes for protein drugs with improved accuracy compared to conventional prediction models trained on binding affinity data.

Research Proposal:
We propose to develop and validate a machine learning model, NNAlign_MAC, trained on mass spectrometry data to predict MHC class II antigen presentation and T cell epitopes for protein drugs. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset of mass spectrometry eluted ligands and binding affinity measurements, and its performance will be compared to conventional prediction models such as NetMHCIIpan. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated by correlating its predictions with experimental MAPPs data and T cell epitope responses. This research will provide a novel approach for improving the prediction of immunogenicity of protein drugs, potentially reducing the need for costly and labor-intensive experimental assays."

coveD] of mammalian G1 cyclins just 4 years ago and the 
identification of their associated cyclin-dependent ki- 
nases (cdks) provided key insights soon thereafter as to 
how progression through the first gap phase (G~) of the 
mammalian cell cycle might be regulated positively. 
Within the past 18 months, we have begun to learn 
something about the negative regulators--cdk inhibi- 
tors--that constrain their action. 
Targets of G1 cdk inhibitors: G~ cyclin-dependent 
kinases 
The commitment of cells to enter the DNA synthetic (S) 
phase of the cell cycle occurs at a restriction (R) point 
late in G~ phase, after which mitogenic growth factors 
are no longer required for cells to complete division (Par- 
dee 1989). Cells initiate DNA synthesis 1-3 hr after pass- 
ing the R point, indicating that the decision to enter S 
phase and the actual onset of DNA replication are sepa- 
rately controlled events. At least in part, both are gov- 
erned by G~ cyclins, which assemble with cdks to form 
functional holoenzymes whose phosphorylations of key 
substrates facilitate these transitions (for review in 
greater detail, see Pines 1993; Sherr 1993, 1994a, and 
summarized briefly below). 
As cells enter the cycle from quiescence (Go), D-type 
cyclins and cyclin E are synthesized sequentially during 
the G~ interval (Koff et al. 1991; Lew et al. 1991; Mat- 
sushime et al. 1991), both being rate-limiting for S-phase 
entry (Ohtsubo and Roberts 1993; Quelle et al. 1993; 
Resnitzky et al. 1994) (Fig. 1). Genes encoding D-type 
cyclins (D 1, D2, and D3), progressively induced as part of 
the delayed early response to mitogenic stimulation, are 
expressed in a cell lineage-specific fashion. Because cells 
synthesize different combinations of D-type cyclins, 
none is likely to be essential for G~ progression. Their 
assembly with cdk4 and cdk6 (Matsushime et al. 1992; 
Bates et al. 1994a; Meyerson and Harlow 1994) is regu- 
lated post-translationally by mitogens (Matsushime et 
al. 1994), and once assembled, cyclin D-bound cdks must 
be phosphorylated on a single threonine residue by a cdk- activating kinase (CAK) to acquire catalytic activity 
(Kato et al. 1994b; Matsuoka et al. 1994) (Fig. 1). D-type 
cyclins are short-lived proteins (t~/2<25 min); therefore, 
withdrawal of growth factors during G1 phase prevents 
their steady accumulation and correlates with the failure 
of growth factor-deprived cells to progress past the R 
point. In contrast, their destruction later in the cell cycle 
is without effect (Matsushime et al. 1991). Therefore, a 
cardinal property of the D-type cyclins is their regulation 
by extracellular signals, as opposed to cyclins E, A, and B 
whose expression during the cell cycle is periodic. 
Cyclin D-dependent cdk4 and cdk6 activity are first 
detected in mid-G1 phase and increase as cells approach 
the G1/S boundary (Matsushime et al. 1994; Meyerson 
and Harlow 1994). Unlike other known cdks, cyclin 
D-dependent kinases have a distinct substrate preference 
for the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) over histone H1 
(Matsushime et al. 1992), reflecting the ability of D cy- 
clins to bind to pRb directly (Dowdy et al. 1993; Ewen et 
al. 1993; Kato et al. 1993). Several lines of evidence sug- 
gest that pRb is a key physiologic substrate of cdk4 and 
cdk6 (see below), although other cdks may contribute to 
pRb phosphorylation later in the cycle. In turn, pRb 
binds to and negatively regulates transcription factors, 
such as E2F, whose activities are required for S-phase 
entry (Nevins 1992; Hinds and Weinberg 1994; Sherr 
1994b). pRb phosphorylation at or near the R point can- 
cels its growth-suppressive function, releasing these 
transcription factors from pRb constraint and enabling 
them to activate genes whose products are necessary for 
S-phase entry (Fig. 1}. 
Cyclin E is expressed periodically at maximum levels 
near the G1/S transition, assembling with a distinct cat- 
alytic subunit, cdk2 (Dulic et al. 1992; Koff et al. 1992) 
(Fig. 1). The latter must also be activated by CAK to yield 
a functional holoenzyme (Fisher and Morgan 1994; 
Makela et al. 1994 and references therein). Recent bio- 
chemical data suggest that cyclin E might also activate 
cdk3 (Harper et al. 1995), a catalytic subunit closely re- 
lated to cdk2, which also plays a putative role in G~ exit 
(van den Heuvel and Harlow 1993). In Drosophila, cyclin 
E is essential for completion of G1 and entry into S phase 
(Knoblich et al. 1994). Evidently it regulates a transition 
different from that promoted by cyclin D1, because cy-

Figure 1. Positive and negative regulators of G~ progression. The length of G~ is designated by the arrow at the bottom with the 
restriction (R) point indicated. Early in G~, mitogens activate synthesis of D-type cyclins that assemble with cdk4 or cdk6 (the latter 
not shown). In cells in which ectopic expression of both cyclin D and cdk4 are enforced, their assembly remains growth factor 
dependent, implicating an unknown regulator (""assembly factor"") in the process (Matsushime et al. 1994). Cyclin E is expressed later 
in G~ phase than D-type cyclins and forms complexes with cdk2. Both classes of complexes require CAK-mediated phosphorylation 
to become catalytically active. D-type {and likely E-type) cdks are shown to phosphorylate pRb sequentially, releasing bound tran- 
scription factors (TFs) such as E2F, which activate genes required for S-phase entry. Cyclin E-cdk2 is also suggested to phosphorylate 
other substrates to regulate a separate transition. In principle, cyclin D and E could both contribute to R point control; cyclin 
E-dependent kinases might trigger the onset of S phase. When expressed in G~ phase, Ink4 (INK4) proteins can compete with D cyclins 
for cdk4 and cdk6 to form independent binary complexes and can inhibit the catalytic activity of the assembled, CAK-modified 
complexes. In binding to cyclin-bound cdks, p27 and p21 can also work at two points to interfere sterically with CAK-mediated 
activation and to extinguish the activities of the CAK-modified holoenzymes. 
clin E, but not D1 (Lukas et al. 1994, 1995a; Tam et al. 
1994b), is essential for entry into S phase in mammalian 
cells lacking functional pRb (Ohtsubo et al. 1995). In 
rodent fibroblasts engineered to express inducible cyclin 
D1 or cyclin E (Resnitzky et al. 1994), induction of cyclin 
D1 triggers rapid pRb phosphorylation but cyclin E does 
not (Resnitzky and Reed 1995). In collaboration with cy- 
clin D-dependent kinases, however, the cyclin E-cdk2 
complex may contribute to pRb phosphorylation late in 
G1 (Hinds et al. 1992; Hatakeyama et al. 1994), and it 
likely phosphorylates other key substrates, perhaps act- 
ing to trigger the actual onset of DNA replication once 
cells pass the R point (Fig. 1). 
The identification of D- and E-type cyclins and their 
associated cdks led to vigorous efforts to define the basis 
of their regulation. Arguably, among the most exciting 
recent findings have been the discoveries of novel mam- 
malian G1 cdk inhibitors, whose newly unveiled func- 
tions are now helping to explain how antiproliferative 
signals arrest cells in GI to enable such diverse processes 
as repair of DNA damage, terminal differentiation, and 
~ii ~uc~cn~c. p21 (Cipl, Wall, Sdil, Cap20) 
In normal fibroblasts, the majority of cdks are gathered 
into quaternary complexes that contain, in addition to a 
cyclin and a cdk, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
[(PCNA) a subunit of DNA polymerase-8(pol-8); see be- 
low] and a protein of M r 21,000, p21 (Xiong et al. 1992; 
Zhang et al. 1993). The p21 protein binds directly to cdc2 
(cdkl), cdk2, and cdk4 (Harper et al. 1993; Xiong et al. 
1993a, b; Zhang et al. 1993; Dulic et al. 1994) and copre- 
cipitates with them in enzymatically active complexes 
formed with cyclins A, B, D, and E isolated from non- 
transformed cells (Xiong et al. 1993a; Zhang et al. 1993, 
1994). Molecular cloning of p21, reconstitution of the 
purified protein with cyclin-cdk complexes in vitro, and 
its enforced expression in mammalian cell lines revealed 
that it can act as a potent and universal inhibitor of cdk 
enzyme activity that is capable of inducing cell cycle 
arrest (E1-Deiry et al. 1993; Y. Gu et al. 1993; Harper et 
al. 1993; Xiong et al. 1993b; Noda et al. 1994).

cyclin-cdk complexes in normal cycling cells, p21 is in- 
duced when quiescent fibroblasts and T lymphocytes are 
stimulated to proliferate by mitogenic signals (Firpo et 
al. 1994; Y. Li et al. 1994; Noda et al. 1994; Nourse et al. 
1994; Sheikh et al. 1994). This apparent paradox is re- 
solved by observations that p21-cyclin-cdk complexes 
harvested from proliferating cells retain kinase activity 
that is extinguished by addition of more p21 (Zhang et al. 
1994; Harper et al. 1995). Therefore, conversion of active 
complexes to inactive ones is achieved by changing the 
ratio of p21 to cyclin-cdk, such that active complexes 
contain a single p21 molecule, whereas inactive ones 
include multiple p21 subunits. Induction of p21, or dim- 
inution of cyclin-cdk levels, could lead to cell cycle ar- 
rest by allowing the amount of cyclin-cdk complexes in 
the cell to fall below an inhibitory threshold imposed by 
p21. It remains unclear, however, whether the single 
molecule of p21 present in active cyclin-cdk complexes 
contributes to their function, perhaps by modifying their 
enzymatic activities in a more subtle manner. 
The fact that complexes containing p21 and cyclin- 
cdks also include PCNA (see above) suggests that p21 
might coordinate the effects of cdks on cell cycle pro- 
gression with processes of DNA replication and/or repair 
(Fig. 2). p21 contacts PCNA independently, and inclu- 
sion of PCNA has no apparent effect on the inhibition of 
cyclin-bound cdks by p21 (Zhang et al. 1994). Using an 
SV40-based DNA replication system to study the effects 
of PCNA on DNA replication in vitro, p21 was found to 
block the ability of PCNA to activate DNA pol-8 (Flores- 
Rozas et al. 1994; Waga et al. 1994). PCNA and p21 in- 
teract with one another directly, and the effect of p21 is 
to impede the processive movement of pol-8 during 
DNA chain elongation without affecting the assembly of 
the PCNA-containing pol-~ holoenzyme. Although 
PCNA is also required for nucleotide excision repair of 
DNA, this process is unaffected by p21 (R. Li et al. 1994; 
Shivji et al. 1994). In principle, the interaction of p21 
with PCNA might facilitate a proper balancing of the 
DNA replication and repair machinery throughout the 
cell cycle. The cdk-inhibitory and PCNA-binding domains of p21 
are functionally distinct and reside in the amino-termi- 
nal and carboxy-terminal halves of the molecule, respec- 
tively (Chen et al. 1995; Luo et al. 1995; Nakanishi et al. 
1995; Warbrick et al. 1995). The entire human p21-cod- 
ing sequence is 164 amino acids in length, and residues 
1-71 alone are highly active in inhibiting both cdk activ- 
ity and DNA synthesis in transfected human fibroblasts 
(Nakanishi et al. 1995). Conversely, a 20-amino-acid pep- 
tide comprising residues 141-160 binds PCNA very ef- 
ficiently and inhibits SV40 DNA replication in vitro at 
micromolar concentrations only 10-fold higher than 
those required for the full-length protein (Warbrick et al. 
1995). 
Despite the compelling nature of results emanating 
from experiments using in vitro systems, it is important 
to discem which structural features of p21 are responsi- 
ble for growth arrest and for inhibition of DNA replica- 
tion in vivo. In Xenopus extracts, replication of double- 
stranded DNA was blocked efficiently only by the cdk- 
inhibitory domain of p21 at concentrations similar to 
those of cyclin E-cdk2 (Chen et al. 1995). p21 interrupts 
an early step of DNA synthesis in this system, but not 
the elongation of preassembled replication forks, and the 
replication block could be overcome by addition of cy- 
clins E or A, but not cdk2 or PCNA (Strausfeld et al. 
1994). Therefore, cyclin-cdk2 complexes rather than 
PCNA are limiting and selectively targeted by p21. In 
agreement, introduction of the amino-terminal but not 
the carboxy-terminal domain of p21 suppressed colony 
formation by p53-negative human Saos-2 osteosarcoma 
cells (Chen et al. 1995). In transient assays, however, 
transfection of either the amino- or carboxy-terminal do- 
mains of p21 (each tagged with an SV40 T antigen nu- 
clear localization signal) into mink lung cells signifi- 
cantly inhibited cellular DNA synthesis, although the 
carboxy-terminal segment was relatively less efficient 
(Luo et al. 1995). Deletion of amino acids 66-71 from the 
amino-terminal moiety of p21 resulted in a protein that 
lacked cdk2 inhibitory activity in vitro but retained the 
ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in p53-negative human

with cyclin-cdks to inhibit their activity 
and with PCNA, a subunit of pol-b, to pre- 
vent processive DNA synthesis in vitro. In 
contrast, p21 does not inhibit the role of 
PCNA in DNA repair. Both effects may 
contribute to G~ arrest at ""the p53 check- 
point."" Because G~-specific cdks are inhib- 
ited in vivo, pRb remains unphosphory- 
lated. Certain cell types execute an alterna- 
tive program leading to programmed cell 
death, which appears to depend on other 
functions of p53 {most likely including 
other p53-regulated genes).

fibroblasts (Nakanishi et al. 1995), again suggesting that 
some of the observed growth inhibitory effects may be 
attributable to the p21 PCNA-binding domain. In all 
cases, it appears that the cdk-binding domain of p21 is 
more potent at blocking cell cycle progression than is the 
PCNA-binding domain, although both can clearly in- 
hibit DNA synthesis when present at sufficiently high 
levels. In vivo, the amount of p21 induced by DNA dam- 
age is sufficient to block cdk activity, but it remains to 
be determined whether its level rises high enough to 
block the replicative functions of PCNA. 
In fibroblasts transformed by DNA tumor viruses or in 
those derived from p53-deficient Li-Fraumeni patients, 
newly synthesized p21 and PCNA were no longer de- 
tected in association with cyclin-bound cdks, suggesting 
that expression of functional p53 might somehow facil- 
itate the formation of these higher order complexes 
(Xiong et al. 1993a). Previously the p53 protein was rec- 
ognized to induce G~-phase arrest (Martinez et al. 1991) 
in response to DNA damage (Kastan et al. 1991; Kuerbitz 
et al. 1992), and its loss or inactivation can promote 
chromosomal instability (Kastan et al. 1992; Livingstone 
et al. 1992; Yin et al. 1992; Lu and Lane 1993). Using a 
subtractive hybridization approach to identify p53-re- 
sponsive genes, E1-Deiry and co-workers (1993)fingered 
the p21 gene as a p53-responsive element, implying that 
it may be a central mediator of p53-induced G~ check- 
point control (Fig. 2). In agreement, DNA-damaging 
agents, which stabilize indirectly and thereby increase 
the levels of p53 protein in cells, induce p21 synthesis, 
leading to further binding of p21 to cyclin-cdk com- 
plexes and to their reduced kinase activity (Di Leonardo 
et al. 1994; Dulic et al. 1994; E1-Deiry et al. 1994). The 
ability of p21 to inhibit both the cyclin D- and E-depen- 
dent kinases can explain why ~-irradiated cells arrest in 
G1 phase with hypophosphorylated pRb (cf. Slebos et al. 
1994). Through its independent effects on PCNA, p21 
induction is also presumed to inhibit DNA replication 
without affecting DNA repair (Fig. 2). However, in cells 
harboring mutant p53, p21 is not similarly induced and 
its basal level of expression in cycling cells is dimin- 
ished. Importantly, cells lacking functional p53 would 
have an increased probability of replicating damaged 
DNA, thereby increasing their likelihood of acquiring 
other chromosomal abnormalities and, therefore, predis- 
posing them toward tumor development. 
As an alternative and decidedly more dramatic defense 
against DNA damage, cells can undergo programmed 
cell death. Induction of apoptosis under these circum- 
stances depends at least in part on p53 (Kastan et al. 
1991; Yonish-Rouach et al. 1991; Kuerbitz et al. 1992; 
Clarke et al. 1993; Lotem and Sachs 1993; Lowe et al. 
1993), which could potentially operate by inducing 
""death genes"" (Kastan et al. 1992) or by repressing genes 
necessary for cell survival (Caelles et al. 1994). Cell cycle 
arrest caused by enforced p21 expression need not trigger 
a suicide program, nor does p53-dependent apoptosis re- 
quire p21-induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (Caelles 
et al. 1994; Wagner et al. 1994; Canman et al. 1995). The 
dependency of apoptosls on p53 is retained in pRb-neg- ative cells, implying that p53 provides an important safe- 
guard against the loss of the growth-suppressive function 
of pRb (Debbas and White 1993; Lowe et al. 1994; Mor- 
genbesser et al. 1994; Pan and Griep 1994; Qin et al. 
1994; Symonds et al. 1994; Wu and Levine 1994). 
Important insights into p21 function stem from its in- 
dependent isolation by a completely different approach. 
By transfecting cDNAs from libraries prepared from se- 
nescent human fibroblasts into younger, cycling cells 
and scoring the transfected cells for their inability to 
replicate their chromosomal DNA, three senescent-de- 
rived inhibitors (Sdi genes) were isolated, one of which 
(Sdil) proved to encode p21 (Noda et al. 19941. Expres- 
sion of p21 increased 10- to 20-fold in senescing fibro- 
blasts, paralleling their loss of proliferative capacity. In- 
active cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin Dl-cdk2 complexes also 
accumulate in senescent cells {Dulic et al. 1993), and the 
former complexes may well be held in check by p21. 
Whereas cyclins D2 and D3 can activate cdk2, it appears 
that cyclin Dl-cdk2 complexes remain catalytically in- 
ert (Ewen et al. 1993a), possibly because they are not 
activated by CAK (Dulic et al. 1993; Bates et al. 1994a). 
In this setting cyclin D1 might itself act as a cdk inhib- 
itor. 
During mouse development, p21 mRNA, visualized by 
in situ hybridization, is localized in a highly selective 
manner to tissues that primarily contain postmitotic dif- 
ferentiated cells (Parker et al. 1995). This is particularly 
manifest in differentiating skeletal muscle, where p21 is 
coexpressed temporally with myogenin. Muscle differ- 
entiation is blocked in mice lacking myogenin (Hasty et 
al. 1993), but their undifferentiated myoblasts express 
p21 and exit the cell cycle normally. Although p21 in- 
duction may be essential for G 1-phase arrest in response 
to DNA damage, the fact that it can be expressed at high 
levels in p53-negative cells indicates that the gene must 
also be regulated independently by other transcription 
factors (Jiang et al. 1994; Michieli et al. 1994; Sheikh et 
al. 1994; Parker et al. 1995). 
Induction of p21 has also been observed in cultured 
hematopoietic cell lines undergoing differentiation 
(Jiang et al. 1994; Steinman et al. 1994). Paralleling the 
results obtained with muscle cells in vivo, p21 mRNA 
and protein synthesis are induced during differentiation 
of cultured myoblasts, preceding the expression of mus- 
cle differentiation markers such as myosin light chain, 
and correlating with the withdrawal of the cells from the 
cycle (Halevy et al. 1995). In myoblasts shifted to me- 
dium containing a low concentration of serum, the skel- 
etal muscle-specific transcriptional regulator, MyoD, 
was found to activate p21 gene expression in a p53-inde- 
pendent manner, in accord with the ability of MyoD to 
induce cell cycle arrest. Transfection of undifferentiated 
myoblasts with the p21 gene (or with the specific cyclin 
D-dependent kinase inhibitor, pl6INK4a; see below) in- 
creased muscle-specific gene expression, even in cells 
maintained under nondifferentiating conditions in high 
serum. Conversely, the enforced expression of cyclin D 1, 
but not cyclins E, A, or B, prevented MyoD from activat- 
ing the expression of muscie-specific genes (Rao er al. 
1152 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 
 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on January 1, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from GI phase CDK inhibitors 
1994; Skapek et al. 1995). Thus, active cyclin D-depen- 
dent kinases both enforce G1 progression and suppress 
MyoD function in proliferating cultured myoblasts 
grown in high serum (Fig. 3A). A highly phosphorylated 
form of MyoD was detected under conditions where dif- 
ferentiation is precluded, but the significance of these 
modifications remains unclear and the kinases responsi- 
ble for them have not been identified. Shifting these cells 
to medium containing low serum would reduce mito- 
gen-responsive cyclin D-cdk activity, activating sequen- 
tially both MyoD and p21 and thereby ensuring the con- 
tinued activity of MyoD as the growth-arrested cells dif- 
ferentiate (Halevy et al. 1995; Skapek et al. 1995)(Fig. 
3B). Given that the loss of pRb function prevents the 
normal Go arrest observed in differentiated skeletal mus- 
cle (W. Gu et al. 1993; Thorburn et al. 1993; J. Schneider 
et al. 1994), it seems likely that cyclin D-dependent ki- 
nases play a central role in inactivating both MyoD and 
pRb. Direct physical interactions between the latter two 
proteins have been reported (W. Gu et at. 1993), which, at 
least in principle, could help to coordinate their action. 
p27 (Kipl) and p57 {Kip2) 
Mink MvlLu lung epithelial cells arrest in G1 phase 
when grown to high density, and their entry into S phase 
is prevented if they are released from contact inhibition 
in the presence of transforming growth factor-J3 [TGF-[3). 
Although contact-inhibited or TGF-J3-treated cells ex- 
press cyclin E-cdk2 complexes, cyclin E-associated ki- 
nase activity cannot be detected (Koff et al. 1993). Ex- 
tracts prepared from such cells contained saturable quan- tities of a heat-stable cyclin E-cdk2 inhibitor, whose 
activity could be overcome by addition of supraphysio- 
logic quantities of recombinant cyclin E (Polyak et al. 
1994a). If instead, cyclin D-cdk4 complexes were added 
to inhibitory extracts from TGF-J3-arrested or contact- 
inhibited cells, subthreshold levels of cyclin E proved 
capable of activating cdk2. Mutant, catalytically inactive 
cyclin D-cdk4 complexes were equally effective in re- 
versing the effects of the inhibitor on cyclin E-cdk2, sug- 
gesting that the cyclin D-cdk4 complexes acted stoi- 
chiometrically in binding and sequestering the inhibi- 
tory components in the extracts. The inhibitor bound 
efficiently to cyclin-cdk complexes, but not to cdks 
alone, and its purification from boiled cell lysates by 
chromatographic methods and affinity chromatography 
on cyclin E-cdk2 matrices led to the identification of a 
single Mr 27,000 polypeptide designated kinase inhibi- 
tory protein-1 (Kip1)(Polyak et al. 1994a). 
Microsequencing of purified p27 and molecular clon- 
ing of genes encoding the protein from mink, mouse, and 
human cDNA libraries (Polyak et al. 1994b), as well as 
isolation of the mouse gene from a ""two-hybrid"" inter- 
active screen in yeast using cdk4 as ""bait"" (Toyoshima 
and Hunter 1994), revealed that p27 and p21 share sig- 
nificant amino acid homology in their amino-terminal 
domains. A 60-amino-acid segment at the amino-termi- 
nal end of human p27 is 44% identical to the correspond- 
ing sequences of human p21, and a polypeptide repre- 
senting this region contained considerable cdk inhibi- 
tory on its own (Polyak et al. 1994b). [The analogous 
segment of p21 is similarly required for its cdk inhibitory 
activity {see above).] Transfection of expression vectors

synthesis continues, pRb undergoes peri-

phosphorylated and remains inactive. It is 
not known whether MyoD phosphoryla- 
tion contributes to its inactivity, and the 
kinases that catalyze this modification 
have not been identified. For simplicity, 
only a single site of phosphorylation is in- 
dicated in the schematic. Shifting cells to 
medium containing low serum should de- 
crease the rate of cyclin synthesis, leading 
to inactivation of at least part of the cy- 
clin-cdk pool {B). Under these conditions, 
pRb begins to accumulate in its hypophos- 
phorylated form, and MyoD becomes ac- 
tive. MyoD activates transcriptionally 
both muscle-specific genes and p21. Induc- 
tion of p21 further inhibits cdks, enforcing 
a positive feedback loop that might ulti- 
mately make cell cycle exit irreversible. Terminal differentiation depends on pRb function, and cells lacking functional pRb can

encoding p27 into mink MvlLu cells or into human 
Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells induced G1 arrest (Polyak et 
al. 1994b; Toyoshima and Hunter 1994). Because Saos-2 
cells do not express functional pRb and p53, p27-induced 
arrest must not depend on either of these tumor-suppres- 
sor proteins. Like p21, p27 binds more avidly to cyclin- 
cdk complexes than to cdks alone and can inhibit the 
activity of cyclin D-, E-, A-, and B-dependent kinases in 
vitro. Whereas cyclin D1 and cdk4 were detected in p27 
immunoprecipitates prepared from proliferating mouse 
Swiss-3T3 cells, cdc2, cdk2, and cyclins E, A, or B 1 were 
not visualized easily (Toyoshima and Hunter 1994). 
However, in other proliferating cell types, complexes be- 
tween p27 and cyclin E-cdk2 have been detected readily 
(Hengst et al. 1994; Nourse et al. 1994). The binding of 
p27 to different cyclin-cdk complexes need not connote 
selective interactions. Rather, under circumstances 
where certain cyclin-cdk complexes are more prevalent 
than others, simple mass action might determine the 
distribution of p27 among them. 
Expression of p27 mRNA in quiescent or proliferating 
MvlLu cells is invariant, and TGF-[3 treatment does not 
affect its abundance detectably (Polyak et al. 1994b). 
More surprising were initial observations that p27 pro- 
tein levels appeared not to change as cells exited Go and 
progressed through the cell cycle (Toyoshima and 
Hunter 1994). However, it is likely that many estab- 
lished cell lines have ""learned"" to bypass negative regu- 
latory controls in the process of adaptation to culture. 
We might anticipate that there would be significant dif- 
ferences in the expression of cdk inhibitors in estab- 
lished cell lines versus diploid strains, or, more problem- 
atically for experimentalists, between cultured cells and 
those in normal tissues. With these caveats in mind, 
studies in a number of cell systems now suggest that p27 
protein levels are subject to considerable post-transla- 
tional regulation. 
Levels of cdk inhibitory activity, attributable at least 
in part to p27, are relatively high in quiescent MvlLu 
epithelial cells and fall as cells progress through G~ 
phase, correlating inversely with the activation of cyclin 
E-cdk2 and directly with the progressive loss of sensi- 
tivity to TGF-{3-mediated arrest as cells approach the 
G~/S boundary (Polyak et al. 1994a; Slingerland et al. 
1994). In cultured macrophages dependent on colony- 
stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) for G~ progression, p27 lev- 
els are elevated in arrested CSF-l-deprived cells and de- 
cline in response to growth factor stimulation (Kato et al. 
1994a). Analogs or inducers of cAMP prevent Gx progres- 
sion in CSF-1 stimulated macrophages, arresting the 
cells in mid-GD and although cyclin Dl-cdk4 complexes 
assemble normally in cAMP-treated cells, they remain 
catalytically inactive. Inducers of cAMP increase the 
overall level of p27, and more p27 accumulates in com- 
plexes with cyclin D 1-cdk4. Under these circumstances, 
CAK is blocked by cdk4-bound p27 from accessing and 
activating the kinase, underscoring the capability of p27 
to inhibit not only fully functional cyclin-cdk com- 
plexes but also to interfere physically with their activa- 
tion by CAK (see Fig. 1) (Kato et al. 1994a; Polyak et al. 1994b). p27 also accumulates in quiescent human fibro- 
blast strains and in HeLa cells arrested in Gx phase by 
treatment with lovastatin (Hengst et al. 1994; Nourse et 
al. 1994). However, some of the cyclin E-cdk2 inhibitory 
activity detected in quiescent diploid fibroblasts can be 
attributed to other molecules (Ohtsubo et al. 1995). In 
yet another setting involving mitogenic activation of 
normal peripheral blood T cells, formation of functional 
cyclin-cdk2 complexes does not occur in the absence of 
interleukin-2 (IL-2), and quiescent cells, as well as those 
stimulated by the antigen receptor to enter but not prog- 
ress through G1 phase, express very high levels of p27 
(Firpo et al. 1994; Nourse et al. 1994}. Whereas antigen 
receptor signaling promotes the synthesis of cyclin D2- 
cdk, E-cdk, and A-cdk complexes (Ajchenbaum et al. 
1993; Firpo et al. 1994; Modiano et al. 1994), stimulation 
by IL-2 leads to the rapid elimination of p27, facilitating 
activation of the assembled G~ phase cdks and entry into 
S phase (Nourse et al. 1994). Conversely, the immuno- 
suppressant rapamycin inhibits G~ progression by pre- 
venting the IL-2-mediated decline in p27 levels. Interest- 
ingly, rapamycin also prevents the IL-2-dependent accu- 
mulation of p21, consistent with the idea that p21 
performs an essential function in cycling cells (see 
above). These results provide a mechanistic explanation 
for why two distinct extracellular signals may be re- 
quired for the Go to S-phase transition in normal periph- 
eral blood T cells. A similar mechanism might explain 
analogous phenomena in normal fibroblast stains where 
the combined action of so-called competence and pro- 
gression factors is also required (Pardee 1989). 
The latter findings also highlight a major difference 
between p21 and p27 during the initial response to 
growth factor stimulation. Namely, whereas p27 tends 
to accumulate in quiescent cells and declines in response 
to mitogenic stimulation, p21 levels are generally low in 
quiescent cells but rise in response to mitogen treat- 
ment. Because p21 levels remain elevated in irreversibly 
postmitotic or nondividing senescent cells (see preceding 
section), these states of growth arrest differ from that of 
quiescent cells, which retain a proliferative capacity. 
Although the amount of p27 falls significantly during 
the Go to S-phase transition, it continues to be synthe- 
sized in proliferating cells, leaving the possibility open 
that its expression might also be regulated periodically. 
In HeLa cells synchronized in M phase with nocodazole, 
or in elutriated HL60 leukemia cells in which cell size 
correlates with cell cycle position, p27 levels were found 
to be highest in G 1-enriched fractions and declined as 
cyclin E accumulated (Hengst et al. 1994). Under certain 
circumstances, p27 can accumulate without an apparent 
increase in mRNA or protein synthesis; therefore its lev- 
els may be controlled by its turnover. However, in other 
biologic settings, the abundance of p27 mRNA and pro- 
tein correlate much more closely. Evidently, the levels of 
p27 can be regulated through a number of different 
mechanisms. 
The expression of both p21 and p27 in cycling cells 
implies that cyclin-cdk complexes must overcome an 
inhibitory threshold to become catalytically active 
1154 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 
 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on January 1, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from GI phase CDK inhibitors 
(Polyak et al. 1994a). As opposed to quiescent cells where 
p27 is present in excess of cyclin-cdk complexes, cyclin- 
cdk levels must exceed those of the inhibitors in cycling 
cells, and consequently the pools of p27 and p21 become 
sequestered into cyclin-cdk complexes (Toyoshima and 
Hunter 1994; Zhang et al. 1994; Harper et al. 1995). For 
cells entering the cycle, the timing of activation of cyclin 
D-dependent kinases in mid-G~ phase (Matsushime et al. 
1994; Meyerson and Harlow 1994) is consistent with the 
idea that their kinase activity first becomes manifest as 
the putative cdk inhibitory threshold is exceeded (Fig. 
4A). An important feature of this model is that cyclin 
D-cdk complexes are perceived to play a dual role in 
stoichiometrically titrating cdk inhibitors as well as in 
phosphorylating critical substrates necessary for G1 exit. 
A prediction is that agents that inhibit the formation of 
cyclin D-cdk complexes selectively might lead to an in- 
crease in ""free"" p21 and p27, thereby inhibiting cyclin 
E-cdk2 and enforcing G 1 arrest (Fig. 4B). For example, 
TGF-[3 inhibits cdk4 synthesis and assembly with cyclin 
D (Ewen et al. 1993b, 1995), correlating with the ob- 
served p27-mediated inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2 activity 
(Koff et al. 1993; Polyak et al. 1994a; Slingerland et al. 
1994). Effects of this cytokine on cdk4 synthesis may be p53 dependent (Ewen et al. 1995). Conversely, enforced 
expression of cdk4 renders MvlLu mink lung cells resis- 
tant to TGFq3-induced Gl-phase arrest (Ewen et al. 
1993b). Therefore, threshold levels of expression of cdk 
inhibitors may set a dependency of cyclin E-cdk2 acti- 
vation on the prior assembly of cyclin D-dependent ki- 
nases, determining the order of phosphorylation of their 
substrates during GI progression. The model provides a 
rationale for the continued expression of cdk inhibitors 
in cycling cells. 
In principle, any cdk inhibitor might act as a tumor- 
suppressor protein (Hunter and Pines 1994). In human 
leukemias, there is a relatively high incidence of hetero- 
zygous deletions at chromosome 12p 12-13 involving the 
KIP1 locus, but the failure to detect mutations within 
the coding sequences of the remaining alleles in these 
cases leaves its candidacy as a tumor suppressor uncer- 
tain (Bullrich et al. 1995; Pietenpol et al. 1995; Ponce- 
Castaneda et al. 1995). Given that relatively small 
changes in p27 levels are sufficient to arrest the cell cy- 
cle, it may be that haploid insufficiency can allow inap- 
propriate proliferation of certain hematopoietic cell 
types.

cells entering the cycle, cyclin D-cdk 
complexes sequester p21 and p27 mole- 
cules. As the amount of cyclin D-cdk 
complexes exceeds a threshold imposed by 
the fluctuating levels of the two inhibitors 
(see text), cyclin D-dependent kinase ac- 
tivity becomes detectable in mid-G~ phase 
and continues to increase as cells progress 
toward S phase. Titration of p21 and p27 
would enable cyclin E-cdk2 complexes to 
assemble in a functionally active form as 
cells approach the G l/S boundary, thereby 
setting a dependence of cyclin E-cdk2 ac- 
tivity on formation of the cyclin D-cdk 
complexes. Both the stoichiometric and 
catalytic functions of cyclin D-cdk com- 
plexes are proposed to be necessary for G~ 
progression. {B) Extracellular signals can 
influence the ratio of cdk inhibitors to cy- 
clin-cdk complexes by several indepen- 
dent mechanisms. Growth factor starva- 
tion or treatment of cells with TGF-[3 can 
negatively affect cyclin D or cdk4 synthe- 
sis, respectively. In addition, TGF-B in- 
duces p15 INK4b, a specific inhibitor of cy- 
clin D-dependent kinases. Analogs or in- 
ducers of cAMP, the immunosuppressant 
drug rapamycin, and cell contact inhibi- 
tion prevent the decrease in p27 levels ob- 
served in cells treated with mitogens 
alone.

tains an amino-terminal cdk inhibitory domain homol- 
ogous to those present in both p21 and p27, followed by 
unique proline-rich (28%) and acidic segments (37% glu- 
tamic and aspartic acid), and distal carboxy-terminal se- 
quences related to those in p27 (Lee et al. 1995; Mat- 
suoka et al. 1995). In vitro-translated mouse p57 Kip2 
bound to cdk2, cdk3, cdk4, and cdk6 in a cyclin-depen- 
dent manner but did not associate with CAK (cdk7-cy- 
clin H) or with baculovirus vector-encoded cyclins pro- 
duced in insect cells. After transfection of MvlLu mink 
lung cells with tagged p57 molecules and retrieval of p57 
from cell lysates, cdk2 and cdk4, as well as cyclins E, A, 
and D 1, were copurified. The p57 Kip2 protein can inhibit 
the kinase activities of cyclin D-cdk4, D-cdk6, E-cdk2, 
E-cdk3, and A-cdk2 complexes in vitro, and its trans- 
fection into mink lung cells (Lee et al. 1995) or into hu- 
man Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells (Matsuoka et al. 1995) 
induced G~ arrest. As for p27 Kip1 (see above), the latter 
findings indicate that neither pRb nor p53 are required 
for these effects of p57 Kip2 on the cell cycle. 
Expression of p57 Kip2 mRNAs is more tissue-restricted 
than that for p27 Kipl, with a 1.5- to 1.7-kb species highly 
expressed in placenta and at lower levels in skeletal mus- 
cle, heart, kidney, lung, pancreas, and brain. An alterna- 
tively spliced 6- to 7-kb p57 mRNA was detected in heart 
(Lee et al. 1995; Matsuoka et al. 1995). Expression of p57, 
studied in developing mouse embryos by in situ hybrid- 
ization, was visualized at days 9.5-15.5 postcoitum in 
brain, the lens epithelium of the eye, skeletal muscle, 
and cartilage with the most intense signals being ob- 
served in cell types that were not proliferating actively. 
In tissues such as skeletal muscle and cartilage, the pat- 
terns of expression of p57 overlapped with those of p21, 
whereas in other tissues, they were quite different (Mat- 
suoka et al. 1995). The chromosomal localization of hu- 
man KIP2 is 1 lp15, a region that undergoes frequent de- 
letions or rearrangements in many forms of human can- 
cer, in patients with the Beckwith-Weidemann 
syndrome, which predisposes to rhabdomyosarcoma and 
other tumors, and in Wilms' tumor (Koufos et al. 1985; 
Koi et al. 1993, and references therein). A putative tu- 
mor-suppressor gene is thought to reside at this locus, 
and KIP2 represents as reasonable a candidate as any. 
p16 ~Ng4a {MTS1, CDKN2, CDK4I) and the Ink4 family 
In cells transformed by the DNA tumor virus SV40, cdk4 
was observed to associate with a protein of Mr 16,000 at 
the expense of D cyclins (Xiong et al. 1993a). The cDNA 
encoding this protein was isolated using a two-hybrid 
interaction screen with cdk4 as bait and was predicted to 
encode a 148-amino-acid polypeptide primarily com- 
posed of four tandemly repeated ankyrin motifs, each 
-32 amino acids in length (Serrano et al. 1993). Recom- 
binant p16 binds to cdk4 or cdk6 but not to cyclins or 
other known cdks, forming a binary complex lacking ki- 
nase activity. Addition of recombinant p16 to catalyti- 
cally active cyclin D--cdk4 or cyclin D-cdk6 complexes 
assembled in insect Sf9 cells potently inhibited their pRb kinase activity, whereas p 16 was without effect on other 
cyclin-cdks. Because of its specificity as an inhibitor of 
cdk4 {and cdk6), the protein was designated Ink4 (now 
Ink4a). 
It was reasoned that the relative abundance of 
p16 INK4a and D-type cyclins might determine the activ- 
ity of the cdk4 kinase in vivo and therefore, regulate 
G 1-phase progression. Enforced expression of p 16 ~NK4a in 
various cell lines induces Gl-phase arrest (Guan et al. 
1994; Lukas et al. 1995b; Serrano et al. 1995). However, 
an apparent paradox was the significant elevation in p 16 
expression observed in tumor cells lacking functional 
pRb [Xiong et al. 1993a; Okamoto et al. 1994; Otterson 
et al. 1994; Tam et al. 1994a; Parry et al. 1995). Why 
should a cdk4 inhibitor be overexpressed in proliferating 
cells that lack this tumor-suppressor protein? 
Serrano and co-workers (1993) suggested that pRb 
might represent the sole critical substrate of D-type 
cdks. Therefore, in cells lacking functional pRb, these 
kinases would not be required, and the inhibitory func- 
tion of p 16 INK4a would not be manifest. Consistent with 
this hypothesis, overexpression of p16 prevents prolifer- 
ation in pRb-positive cells but is ineffective in pRb-neg- 
ative cells (Guan et al. 1994), including embryo fibro- 
blasts derived from Rb-nullizygous mice (Lukas et al. 
1995b; Medema et al. 1995). Similarly, microinjected or 
scrape-loaded antibodies to cyclin D1, although capable 
of preventing S-phase entry in pRb-positive fibroblasts 
(Baldin et al. 1993; Quelle et al. 1993) and inhibiting both 
cyclin D-cdk4 activity and pRb phosphorylation in vivo 
(Lukas et al. 1995a), are noninhibitory when introduced 
into either pRb-negative tumor cells (Lukas et al. 1994; 
Tam et al. 1994b) or into embryo fibroblasts derived from 
homozygous, pRb-deficient mice (Lukas et al. 1995a). 
p16 INK4a can also suppress neoplastic transformation of 
cultured fibroblasts by H-Ras and c-Myc but not by H-ras 
and E1A (Serrano et al. 1995). Therefore, p16 INK4a can act 
upstream of cyclin D-dependent kinases to inhibit their 
phosphorylation of pRb (see Fig. 1), and in the absence of 
pRb function, overexpression of p 16 INK4a or inhibition of 
cyclin D-dependent kinase does not affect Gl-phase pro- 
gression. 
The normal role of p16 INK4a in cell cycle control re- 
mains enigmatic. Because p16 INK4a invokes G~ arrest 
only under conditions in which pRb is present in its 
hypophosphorylated growth-suppressive form, expres- 
sion of p16 in cells that have passed the restriction point 
should have no deleterious effects on their progression 
through the S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle (Lukas 
et al. 1995b). Therefore, it is conceivable that p16 might 
act to down-regulate cdk4 and cdk6 once pRb has been 
inactivated by phosphorylation (Serrano et al. 1993), in 
turn, implying that the activities of these kinases in S, 
G2, or M phase might otherwise be detrimental. The 
simplest way to guarantee such a function would be to 
place the INK4a gene under the control of pRb-regulated 
transcription factors. Alternatively, p16 might act as a 
variable resistor, accumulating concomitantly with pRb 
phosphorylation and determining the rate. If p16 levels 
were to rise as pRb underwent phosphorylation, cyclin 
1156 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 
 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on January 1, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from Gl phase CDK inhibitors 
D-dependent kinases would also need to reach a higher 
threshold to ensure completion of the process. There- 
fore, p 16 might buffer the system by preventing the pre- 
mature activation of pRb by small, ""accidental"" in- 
creases in these kinases. Either model predicts that in 
cycling cells expressing functional pRb, p 16 INKaa should 
be induced in late G1 phase (Tam et al. 1994a). Induction 
of the protein earlier in G~, presumably in response to 
certain antiproliferative signals, would provide a mech- 
anism for invoking G~ arrest. 
pl6-cdk4 and pl6-cdk6 complexes assemble at the 
expense of cyclin D-cdks in tumor cells lacking func- 
tional pRb, either as a result of transformation by DNA 
tumor viruses or in those in which pRb is mutated or 
deleted (Serrano et al. 1993; Xiong et al. 1993a; Bates et 
al. 1994b; Okamoto et al. 1994; Tam et al. 1994a, b; Parry 
et al. 1995). Cyclin D 1 undergoes rapid turnover whether 
unbound or bound to cdk4 or cdk6 (Matsushime et al. 
1992), but the free form is degraded faster (tl/2 = 10 min) 
than the bound species (t~/2 = 25 min)(Bates et al. 1994b). 
Therefore, in pRb-negative tumor cells where p16 com- 
petes with cyclin D for cdk4 or cdk6, the overall level of 
cyclin D expression is reduced. Cyclin D1 transcription 
is also subject to pRb-mediated controls (Miiller et al. 
1994). If increasing amounts of recombinant p16 are 
added to mixtures containing cyclin D and either cdk4 or 
cdk6, p16 and cyclin D form independent binary com- 
plexes with the cdks, suggesting that p16 and cyclin D 
vie with one another for cdk-binding sites during assem- 
bly of the different complexes (Parry et al. 1995). How- 
ever, if p16 is added to catalytically active cyclin D-cdk 
complexes preassembled in insect Sf9 cells, it enters into 
stable ternary complexes with cyclin D-cdk without dis- 
placing the cyclin; nonetheless, the resulting complexes 
are catalytically inactive (Hirai et al. 1995). Together, 
these findings suggest that p16 is a not only a bona fide 
inhibitor of cyclin D-cdk4 holoenzyme activity but can 
also interfere with cyclin-cdk assembly (see Fig. 1). Be- 
cause D-type cyclins turn over much more rapidly than 
either p16 or the cdks in living cells (Matsushime et al. 
1992; Parry et al. 1995), it seems likely that D-type cy- 
clins can be replaced progressively by excess p16 if the 
balance of expressed D-type cyclin and p16 is shifted in 
favor of the latter. 
Although p16 is generally overproduced in pRb-nega- 
tive human tumor cells, this may not be the case in 
mouse embryo fibroblasts containing homozygously dis- 
rupted RB alleles. Comparable amounts of cyclin D 1 and 
D2 proteins in complexes with cdk4 were recovered 
from lysates of RB + / + and RB-/- mouse fibroblasts, 
and no differences in their kinase activities were ob- 
served {Lukas et al. 1995a). These observations could re- 
flect dissimilarities in pRb function in humans versus 
mice. Heterozygous RB § mice fail to develop retino- 
blastoma but, instead, acquire RB-/- pituitary tumors 
later in life arising in cells that have sustained mutations 
in their second RB allele (Clarke et al. 1992; Jacks et al. 
1992; Lee et al. 1992). On the other hand, loss of RB may 
not be sufficient to guarantee p16 induction, and other 
events occurring during multistep carcinogenesis might account for the observed elevations in p 16 levels in pRb- 
negative tumor cells. For example, disruption of pRb 
function may occur in a biologic setting where p 16 levels 
are already elevated. One might imagine that p16 (like 
p21; see above) is induced as certain cells differentiate 
terminally and exit the cell cycle, thereby limiting cy- 
clin D-dependent kinase activity and helping to main- 
tain pRb in its hypophosphorylated growth-suppressive 
form. Several lines of evidence suggest that pRb plays an 
important role in such processes (Coppola et al. 1990; 
Weinberg 1991; W. Gu et al. 1993; Hamel et al. 1993; 
Kato & Sherr 1993; Thorburn et al. 1993; I. Schneider et 
al. 1994). Under these circumstances, loss of pRb func- 
tion would bypass the cdk inhibitory activity of elevated 
p16, maintain ceils in cycle, and predispose to tumor 
formation. 
Presently, three additional genes related to INK4a 
have been isolated, all of which encode polypeptides 
composed of four repeated ankyrin motifs and specifi- 
cally inhibit the activities of the cyclin D-dependent ki- 
nases to induce cell cycle arrest (Guan et al. 1994, 1995; 
Hannon and Beach 1994; Chan et al. 1995; Hirai et al. 
1995). Synthesis of one of these proteins, p15 INK4b, is 
induced in human epithelial (HaCaT) cells by TGF-I3, 
suggesting that it functions as an effector of cell cycle 
arrest mediated by this cytokine (Hannon and Beach 
1994). Unlike results of previous studies with MvlLu 
mink lung epithelial cells, TGF-I3 treatment of HaCaT 
cells had no effect on cdk4 synthesis. Given that cdk4 
overexpression can override TGF-13-induced G~ arrest 
(Ewen et al. 1993b), formation of pl5-cdk4 complexes at",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the regulatory role of p16 INK4a in cell cycle control.,"Research hypothesis: The overexpression of p16 INK4a in pRb-negative tumor cells may not be the cause of the observed elevations in p16 levels, and other events occurring during multistep carcinogenesis might account for the observed elevations in p16 levels in pRb-negative tumor cells.

Research proposal: Investigate the role of p16 INK4a in cell cycle control and tumorigenesis in pRb-negative tumor cells. Examine the relationship between p16 INK4a overexpression and the loss of pRb function in promoting cell cycle progression and tumor formation. Additionally, explore the mechanisms by which p16 INK4a is induced and its potential role in differentiation and cell cycle exit."

A large oligomeric protein composed of ~90 kDa subunitshas been identiﬁed as a tumour-associated antigen (Nataliet al., 1982; Iacobelli et al., 1986, 1993; Linsley et al.,
1986) and in the search for novel ligands of galectin-3(formerly Mac-2) in several previous studies (Rosenberget al., 1991; Koths et al., 1993; Inohara and Raz, 1994).
Human Mac-2 binding protein (M2BP) has been puriﬁedfrom tumour cell medium, serum and milk and was shownto be a non-covalently linked oligomer with a molecularmass of .1000 kDa (Linsley et al., 1986; Iacobelli et al.,
1993; Koths et al., 1993). The sequence of human M2BP
(~570 residues) was elucidated after cDNA cloning andshown to contain a signal peptide and a number ofcysteines and N-glycosylation sites (Koths et al., 1993;
Ullrichet al., 1994). A cyclophilin C-binding mouse
protein with 69% sequence identity has also been cloned(Friedman etal.,1993;ChicheporticheandVassalli,1994)

of M2BP. The former possibility is indicated by geneticevidence (Brakebusch et al., 1997).
The functions of M2BP are not yet well deﬁned but
may include lipopolysaccharide-dependent binding toCD14 (Yu and Wright, 1995), enhancement of killer cellactivity and interleukin production (Ullrich et al., 1994),
tumour suppression (Jallal et al., 1995) and the promotion
of cell aggregation by cross-linking surface-boundgalectin-3 (Inohara et al., 1996). M2BP is present in the
µg/ml range in several biological ﬂuids, where it may
exert some of its functions. Elevated levels are oftenobserved in melanomas, some lung, breast and gastro-intestinal tumours and in some viral infections, and maybe of diagnostic and prognostic value (Longo et al., 1993;
Iacobelli et al., 1994). Its expression in normal tissues
has been less well established and is in part controversial.Yet, a broad expression in gastrointestinal and otherepithelialtissues,muscleandbrainwasshownbyNorthernblots (Ullrich et al., 1994). Immunohistology of some of
these tissues demonstrated a ﬁne granular pattern whichwas interpreted to indicate intracellular deposits (Natalietal.,1982;Iacobelli etal.,1986).Thepossibledeposition
of M2BP in the extracellular matrix has not yet beenconsidered or adequately examined.
In the present study we have addressed this question
by producing recombinant human M2BP, which could beobtained in a native, oligomeric and glycosylated form.The oligomer formed large rings with a diameter of30–40 nm for the most prominent structures. Bindingstudiesin vitrodemonstrated β1 integrin-mediated cell
adhesion for M2BP as well as interactions with somecollagen types and ﬁbronectin—properties which are con-sistent with an extracellular matrix localization. This wasunderscored by immunological analyses of cultured cellsand tissues. The amounts of M2BP in these locations areapparently not very high, suggesting that the protein isstored in the matrix rather than being a major structuralcomponent.
Results
Puriﬁcation and properties of recombinant human
M2BP
Recombinant human M2BP was puriﬁed from serum-free
culture medium by ammonium sulphate precipitation andSepharose CL-6B chromatography and appeared as asingle 90 kDa band by SDS gel electrophoresis (Figure 1).It eluted from the molecular sieve column close to thevoidvolume,indicatingnon-covalentassociationintolargeoligomers.InordertoobtainM2BPinnon-degradedform,the addition of a cocktail of protease inhibitors wasrequired during storage of medium and puriﬁcation. Puri-ﬁed M2BP was eventually dialysed against 0.2 MMac-2 binding protein in extracellular matrix

be kept in a soluble state by storage at –20 or –80°C.
Edman degradation of the non-reduced 90 kDa band
of M2BP demonstrated a single N-terminal sequenceVNDGDMRLAD, which is identical to those previously
determined for serum- and tissue-derived forms (Linsleyet al., 1986; Rosenberg et al., 1991; Koths et al., 1993;
Inohara and Raz, 1994). Reduction produced a slightdecrease in electrophoretic mobility (Figure 1), indicatingthe opening of internal disulphide bridges. Hexosamineanalyses demonstrated 44 69 residues of glucosamine
and16 66residuesofgalactosamineperM2BPmonomer.
A high glycosylation was also demonstrated by a shift ofapparentmolecularmassfrom90to60kDaaftertreatmentwith N-glycosidase F (Figure 1). No shift in mobility wasobserved after digestion with heparitinase or chondroitin-ase ABC, however (data not shown). A short treatmentwith plasmin (Figure 1), endoproteinase Lys-C or trypsincompletely converted M2BP into 67 and 26 kDa bands.Edman degradation of the plasmin digest revealed theoriginalN-terminusforthe67kDabandandtwosequencesstarting at positions 424 (YSSDYFQA) and 437(YYPQSFQ) for the 26 kDa band. The plasmin digeststill eluted close to the void volume of a Superose 6column, indicating that oligomerization was maintained.No substantial cleavage was observed after 24 h treatmentwith endoproteinase Glu-C.
A sensitive and quantitative radioimmunoinhibition
assay could be established with M2BP, showing 50%inhibition at ~10 ng/ml (data not shown). Reduced andalkylatedM2BPwasnotinhibitoryevenat200-foldhigherconcentrations, indicating that the antibodies bind toconformational epitopes. Analysis of media obtained fromEBNA-293 cells transfected with the M2BP expressionvector demonstrated 10–15 µg/ml M2BP. Medium of non-
transfectedcellscontained0.2 µg/mlM2BP,demonstrating
only a low endogenous production. The same analysis ofthree normal human sera showed concentrations in therange 4–19 µg/ml, consistent with previous observations
for M2BP (Linsley et al., 1986).
Oligomerization to ring structures
Analytical ultracentrifugation indicated the presence of
M2BP monomers only in the presence of strong denatur-
1607ants like 6 M guanidine HCl. The molar mass was
92 kDa and the sedimentation coefﬁcient ( s20,w) was 4.1S.
However, under non-dissociative conditions and at aneutral pH the average molar mass was 1000–1500 kDaands
20,wwas 19.8S, indicating high levels of self-asso-
ciation.
The nature of the aggregates was revealed by electron
microscopy (Figure 2). Ring-like structures of 25–45 nmdiameter were seen. There is clearly a distribution of size,but rings of 30–40 nm diameter are most abundant.Frequently a segmentation of the circumference of therings was observed with ﬁve to eight segments of ~15 nmlengthforthemostprominentparticles.Theringsexhibitedsimilardimensionswhenvisualizedafterrotaryshadowing(Figure2A)ornegativestaining(Figure2B)butinadditionsome linear aggregates and ring-to-ring associations wereseen by the latter technique. Negative staining was per-formed at neutral pH with phosphotungstic acid in orderto avoid dissociation of the ring structures. At pH 2.7 indiluteaceticorformicacid,partialtocompletedissociationof the aggregates was observed both by electron micro-scopy (Figure 2C) and by analytical ultracentrifugation(data not shown). The process is completely reversible,asindicatedbyreformationofringsindistinguishablefromthose shown in Figure 2A and B after dialysis from aceticacid, pH 2.7, to neutral buffer, pH 7.4.
The conformational state of M2BP in its aggregated
form at neutral pH was compared with that at acid pH bycircular dichroism (CD) (Figure 3). The CD spectra atpH 2.7 and 7.4 were rather similar and demonstrated thepresence of α-helical and β-structures in the protein. The
spectra thus indicate that M2BP is in a native state underboth conditions. An analysis of different proportions ofsecondary structure appeared to be of little use becauseM2BPmayconsistofatleastfourratherdifferentdomains(see Discussion).
Binding to extracellular matrix ligands
A solid-phase assay was used to examine the bindingpotential of various plastic-immobilized extracellular mat-rix proteins to M2BP used as a soluble ligand. Probablybecause of its large size, at concentrations above 200 nMM2BP already showed some unspeciﬁc binding to serumalbumin, which was used as a blocking protein (Figure4). A distinctly higher binding was observed for collagensV and VI, with half-maximal binding achieved at ~40 nM(Figure 4A). Weaker binding was observed with collagenIV and none with collagens I and III. These collagenswere isolated from pepsin-digested human placenta andtheir triple-helical domains remained essentially undiges-ted and are therefore potential candidates for M2BPbinding. Among several non-collagenous matrix proteinstested, ﬁbronectin was the strongest ligand with half-maximal binding at 10 nM (Figure 4B). The basementmembrane protein nidogen was ~10-fold less active. Nosubstantial binding above the albumin background wasobserved with ﬁbulin-1 and -2 (Figure 4B) and withlaminin-1, perlecan and BM-40 (data not shown). Thisindicated a rather selective interaction of M2BP withcomponents of the extracellular matrix. Galectin-3, how-ever, was the strongest ligand for M2BP ( ,1 nM) in the
solid-phase assay (Figure 4B), which conﬁrmed previousdemonstrations of their high afﬁnity by immunoprecipit-T.Sasaki et al .

Cell adhesion is mediated through b1 integrins
When used as a plastic-immobilized substrate, M2BP
caused a distinct dose-dependent adhesion and spreadingof HBL-100 cells, comparable with that of laminin andperlecan (Figure 5). Similar results, with plateau levelscorresponding almost exactly to those of laminin, wereobtained for human Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells, humanepidermoid A431 cells, rat RN22 Schwannoma cells andrat Rugli glioma cells. Human astrocytoma 251MG cellsalso showed a distinct adhesion to M2BP but not tolaminin. The cell-adhesive activity of M2BP was com-pletely lost after reduction and alkylation (Figure 5). AsshownforA431cellsinFigure6,thisadhesionismediatedthrough integrin receptors, as it could be completelyinhibited by a blocking antibody (AIIB2) against β1
integrin for both M2BP and laminin substrates. Lamininadhesion was also partially blocked by antibodies againstα2 andα6 integrin subunits, consistent with the previous
identiﬁcation of α2β1 andα6β1 integrins as laminin
receptors (Aumailley et al., 1996). The latter two anti-
bodies had only marginal effects on M2BP-mediatedadhesion, however, indicating that A431 cells adhere tolaminin and M2BP through different sets of β1 integrins.

(data not shown). Further inhibition studies of RN22 andRugli cell adhesion to M2BP with lactose (5 mM) andthe synthetic peptides GRGDS (0.5 mM) and RGES(0.5 mM) at the maximal concentrations indicated failedto produce signiﬁcant effects. This is consistent with thelack of a cell-adhesive RGD sequence in human M2BPMac-2 binding protein in extracellular matrix

(Kothset al., 1993; Ullrich et al., 1994) and indicates that
galectin-3 is not involved in these adhesions.
Production by cultured cells and deposition in
tissues
Conditioned media from human melanoma (Natali et al.,
1982; Inohara and Raz, 1994) and other tumour celllines (Iacobelli et al., 1986, 1993; Linsley et al., 1986;
Rosenberg et al., 1991; Koths et al., 1993) had been a

and amounts at the lower end of this range for a ﬁbro-sarcoma and an epithelial cell line. The lowest amounts(0.044µg/ml) were detected in ﬁbroblast medium. Only
3% of the total M2BP was deposited in the ﬁbroblastcell layer, however, as shown by urea extraction, whichsolubilizes most of the ﬁbrillar ﬁbronectin (Sasaki et al.,
1996).

was used as a control for the background staining by non-immune rabbit IgG. In the testis, nidogen was restrictedto the seminiferous tubular basement membranes andsome vessels, while M2BP staining was strongest in theinterstitial spaces between individual tubules. WeakerM2BP staining, but still above background, was alsopresent around epithelial and/or Sertoli cells within theT.Sasaki et al .

1610tubules (Figure 7A). A similar distinction between base-
ment membrane staining for nidogen and an interstitialstaining for M2BP underneath the basement membrane ina punctate and streak-like fashion was observed for theuterus (not shown). Because of the immunostimulatoryproperty of M2BP (Ullrich et al., 1994), we also used
spleen and thymus for immunostaining. In the spleen,restricted regions of strong M2BP staining were observedwithin the white pulpa (Figure 7B) as identiﬁed by aparallel haematoxylin–eosin staining. Similar restrictedregions of M2BP deposits were also observed in thethymus cortex and medulla, even though backgroundbinding was higher than in other organs (Figure 7C).Nidogen staining in skeletal muscle was conﬁned to
the endomysium surrounding individual muscle ﬁbres.Distinct staining for M2BP was again restricted to shortstreaks within or close to the endomysium (Figure 7D).These streaks occasionally showed a co-localization withbungarotoxin-stained synapses (C.Brakebusch, unpub-lished). Together, this indicates a preferred pericellularand/orextracellularmatrixdepositionofM2BP,andsimilarpatterns were also observed for intestinal and dermaltissue sections (data not shown).Mac-2 binding protein in extracellular matrix
Discussion
Recombinant human M2BP was obtained as a native
protein as shown by CD spectroscopy, electron micro-scopy, protease resistance and immunological epitopeanalysis. It also formed large non-covalent oligomers asshownpreviouslyforM2BPpuriﬁedfrombiologicalﬂuidsand tumour cell culture medium (Linsley et al., 1986;
Iacobelli et al., 1993; Koths et al., 1993). Recombinant
M2BP was heavily substituted with ~60 hexosamines butapparentlydidnotcontainheparanandchondroitinsulfate.This suggested occupation of all seven N-linked and ~16O-linkedoligosaccharideacceptorsites,inagreementwithsequence predictions (Koths et al., 1993; Ullrich et al.,
1994). There was a loss of ~30 kDa mass after treatmentwith N-glycosidase F. Recombinant M2BP was shown topromote cell adhesion and to bind selectively to severalcollagen types and ﬁbronectin as well as to galectin-3.These properties would suggest that, apart from its pres-ence in biological ﬂuids such as serum and milk, M2BPalso has a localization in the extracellular matrix, and thishas now been conﬁrmed in tissue studies.
A prominent feature of M2BP is its oligomerization to
large ring structures. This unusual self-assembly was
detected by electron microscopy of M2BP in the presentwork. Earlier studies by gel chromatography suggestedthe presence of aggregates in solution without specifyingtheir geometry. Our own ultracentrifugal data indicate amolar mass of 1000–1500 kDa and a sedimentationcoefﬁcient of ~20S.
The circularnature ofthe self-assembly complexesmay
be explained by a tilted arrangement of complementarybinding sites. The rings show a variation of size centredat diameters of 30–40 nm, indicating some ﬂexibility inthe arrangement of the interaction sites at the level ofM2BP monomers. Some of the rings are segmented atintervals of ~15 nm and ﬁve to eight segments can bedistinguished at the circumference of the most abundantrings. The exact number of monomers forming rings ofﬁve, six, seven or eight segments will need evaluation bymass determination with scanning transmission electronmicroscopy (STEM). As a rough estimate, 10–16 mono-mersofmolarmass92kDafollowfromtheultracentrifugalanalysis, suggesting that each segment may be composedof two monomers. Further information on the mode ofpacking of M2BP monomers in the ring-like complexesmayalsoemergefromstudiesofthereversiblepH-induceddissociation and association reactions and by the possibledetection of intermediates of the assembly process. In thecourse of future work, individual domains of M2BP mayalso be prepared by recombinant methods in order tolocalize the sites for self-assembly and interaction withother extracellular matrix ligands.
Suchdomainsareindicatedfromthesequenceofhuman
M2BP(Koths etal.,1993;Ullrich etal.,1994)particularly
at the N-terminus (positions 19–125), which contains sixcysteines and is homologous to the scavenger receptorcysteine-rich domain (Freeman et al., 1990) shared also
bytheT-lymphocytereceptorsCD5andCD6(Jones etal.,
1986; Aruffo et al., 1991), the complement factor I
(Goldberger etal.,1987)andseveralmoreproteins(Aruffo
et al., 1991). A protein even more closely related to
M2BP both in size and sequence identity (69%) is mouse
1611cyclophilin C-binding protein (Friedman et al., 1993;
Chicheportiche and Vassalli, 1994). A sequence compar-ison of these two proteins indicates to us three moreshared modules, two in the central region (126–280 withsix Cys; 281–420, Cys-free) and one at the C-terminus(421–585 with four Cys). The latter apparently comprisesthe 26 kDa fragment Pl-2, which is readily released fromM2BP but apparently not further degraded by neutralproteinases (Figure 1). Whether these postulated modulesalso represent autonomous folding units within theseproteins remains to be studied. Equally important is thequestion as to whether cyclophilin C-binding protein alsoself-assembles into ring-like structures.
Northern blot analyses have demonstrated a moderate
to strongexpression ofM2BP in alarge numberof normaltissues (Ullrich et al., 1994). Those which contribute to
the levels of M2BP observed in the circulation have notyet been identiﬁed. The widespread mRNA expressionagrees with our immunoﬂuorescence data, which detectedM2BP in all normal tissues analysed so far. The datatogether strongly indicate local production, particularlysinceextravasationasanoriginofinterstitialM2BPseemsvery unlikely considering its size. The staining patternsalso strongly suggest a restricted extracellular depositionof M2BP, but in some cell-rich tissues such as testis,spleen and thymus there is also a close pericellularlocalization. The demonstration of M2BP in the latter twotissues was of particular interest considering the in vitro
evidencethatM2BPisapotentimmunestimulator(Ullrichet al., 1994). The restricted nest-like appearance of M2BP
in the spleen is reminiscent of germinal centres of clonalimmune cell expansion and deserves a more detailedstudy. Most of the basement membranes, as revealed bydouble staining with nidogen, seem to contain no, or onlylittle, M2BP. Yet, the precise association of M2BP withspeciﬁc supramolecular structures of the extracellularmatrix remains to be identiﬁed by immunoelectron micro-scopy. Based on our binding studies with extracellularligands, such structures could include microﬁbrils formedfrom collagen VI (Timpl and Chu, 1994) or ﬁbronectin(Hynes, 1990) but would not exclude other structures.Cultured ﬁbroblasts are known to elaborate a dense mesh-work of ﬁbronectin ﬁbrils but secrete and deposit M2BP,as shown here, in .10-fold lower amounts compared with
ﬁbronectin (Sasaki et al., 1996). This suggests that M2BP
is not an essential structural element of such microﬁbrilsbut may use them for extracellular storage.
M2BP was hitherto considered to promote cell–cell
contacts through cross-linking of surface-bound galectin-3 (Inohara et al., 1996). Our observation of the strong
promotionofcelladhesionandspreadingbyM2BP,whichseems to be mediated by β1 integrins and is independent
of galectin-3, adds a new perspective to its potentialcellular interactions. This could include the promotion ofﬁrmcellanchoragewithinparticularextracellularmatricesas well as the action as a cytokine that stimulates theactivity of natural killer cells (Ullrich et al., 1994). The
latter interpretation would agree with other observationsthat many identiﬁed cytokines are stored in the extracellu-larmatrixwhichcontrolstheiractivity,stabilityandrelease(Taipale and Keski-Oja, 1997). We therefore consider thatour recombinant analysis has revealed not only a uniquering-like self-assembly, but also several new biologicalT.Sasaki et al .

Materials and methods
Recombinant production and puriﬁcation
An expression plasmid for full-length human M2BP in the pCMV vector(Ullrichet al., 1994) was linearized with BamH1, blunt-ended by ﬁlling
in the 3 9-recessed end with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and
then digested with Xhol. A 2.3 kb BamH1–XhoI fragment containing
the whole coding and some 5 9and 3 9untranslated regions of M2BP was
gel puriﬁed and inserted into the episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu(Kohfeldt et al., 1997) which was digested with PvuII andXhoI. Human
embryonic kidney cells which express the EBNA-1 protein of Epstein–Barr virus (EBNA-293, Invitrogen) were used for transfections andtransfectants were selected with 0.5 µg/ml puromycin. Serum-free
medium collected from cultures was stored at –20°C after adding EDTAand Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim) to 1 and 0.4 mM, respectively.M2BP was precipitated from this medium (1 litre) by adding solidammonium sulphate to 50% saturation (8 h at 4°C). The precipitate wasdissolved in 12 ml 0.05M Tris–HCl pH 7.4 and 0.15 M NaCl containingprotease inhibitors, and passed over a Sepharose CL-6B column(33130 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer (Paulsson et al., 1987a).
Pooled fractions were then concentrated with Amicon, dialysed against0.2 M NH
4HCO3containing protease inhibitors and stored in small
aliquots at –20 or –80°C.
Sources of proteins
Collagens I, III, IV, V and VI were solubilized from human placenta bypepsin and puriﬁed following established protocols (Miller and Rhodes,1982; Odermatt et al., 1983; Vandenberg et al., 1991). Laminin-1 and
perlecan were obtained from a mouse tumour (Paulsson et al., 1987a,b).
Recombinant mouse nidogen (Fox et al., 1991), ﬁbulin-1 (Sasaki et al.,
1995), ﬁbulin-2 (Pan et al., 1993) and human BM-40 (Nischt et al.,
1991) were as described previously. Human ﬁbronectin was obtainedfrom Behringwerke, Marburg. Recombinant galectin-3, based on apreviously published expression vector (Agrwal et al., 1993), was a kind
gift of H.Gabius, Munich.
Sources of antibodies and immunological assays
Monoclonal antibody against human (AIIB2; Hall et al., 1990)β1
integrin was kindly supplied by C.Damsky. Monoclonal antibodiesagainstα6 integrin (GoH3) were a gift of A.Sonnenberg and those
againstα2integrin(Gi9)werepurchased(Biomol,Hamburg).Production
of rabbit antisera against recombinant M2BP, afﬁnity puriﬁcation ofantibodies and radioimmunoassays followed standard protocols (Timpl,1982). After elution from a M2BP column, the antibody was furtherpuriﬁed on a Superose 12 column. Immunoblotting of tissue extractsand indirect immunoﬂuorescence followed previously described pro-cedures (Pan et al., 1993; Sasaki et al., 1996). In immunoﬂuorescence,
the puriﬁed antibody and normal rabbit IgG as negative control wereusedatthesameconcentrations(5 µg/ml).Doublestainingwasperformed
with monoclonal antibody BE 1/4 against mouse nidogen (Dziadeket al., 1988).
Enzymatic and chemical modiﬁcation
Complete reduction and alkylation of disulphide bonds in 6 M guanidinewas done as described (Paulsson et al., 1987b). Treatments with
heparitinase I and chondroitinase ABC followed a previously usedprotocol (Costell et al., 1997). Treatment of 20 µg M2BP with 10 units
N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) was done at 37°C for 18 h in20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and0.1% SDS, after denaturation by heating at 97°C (5 min) in thepresence of 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteolytic digestions(enzyme:substrate ratio, 1:100) were fo r4ha t37°C.
Physical and electron microscopic methods
For analytical ultracentrifugation, an Optima XL-A (Beckmann Instru-ments) with an AnS rotor and 12 nm ﬁlled Epon cells was employed.Sedimentation coefﬁcients ( s
20,w) were evaluated from sedimentation
velocity experiments at a rotor speed of 52 000 r.p.m. and molecularmasses (M) from sedimentation equilibrium experiments at 5200 r.p.m.Measurements were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) or 0.1 M acetic acid at 18°C, and data evaluationwas by standard methods assuming a partial speciﬁc volume of
16120.697 ml/g, which is the calculated value for a protein with 30% weightglycosylation (Ralston, 1993).
Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Cary 61 spectropolari-
meter (Varian, Zug, Switzerland) using a thermostatted cell of 0.1 mmpath length (Hellma, Mu ¨llheim, Germany). Measurements were per-
formed in PBS or 0.1 M acetic acid. The molar ellipticity (in deg·cm
2/
dmol) was calculated on the basis of a mean residue molecular mass of110 Da.
Electronmicroscopywasperformedbytherotaryshadowingtechnique
as described (Engel, 1994). Protein (25–50 µg/ml) in 0.2 M ammonium
bicarbonate, pH 7.4, or 0.1 M acetic acid was mixed with an equalvolume of glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica discs. Thesewere dried in high vacuum, shadowed with platinum/carbon at an angleof 9° and replicated. Negative staining was performed at neutral pH inorder to avoid dissociation of aggregates by the acid pH in the routineprocedure (Engel, 1994). Ten µl of a solution in PBS was put on a glow
discharged collodium and carbon grid and 5 µl of a 2% sodium
phosphotungstate solution of pH 7 was added. After removal of the ﬁrststain, incubation was repeated for 2 min.
Protein binding and cell adhesion assays and biological
samplesA solid-phase assay with plastic-immobilized ligands and soluble M2BPfollowed a previous procedure (Aumailley et al., 1989a). The cell
adhesion assay as well as the cell lines used have been describedpreviously(Aumailley etal.,1989b;Battaglia etal.,1993).Forinhibition
assays, cells were mixed with various dilutions of inhibitors before beingadded to the substrate. Cell culture and collection of serum-free mediumfollowed standard protocols. Two melanoma cell media were kindlysupplied by R.Nischt. Tissue extracts of 5- to 7-week-old Balb/c micewere obtained as described previously (Sasaki et al., 1996).
Analytical methods
Samples were hydrolysed with 6 or 3 M HCl (110°C, 16 h) for thedetermination of protein concentrations or hexosamine compositions,respectively, on a LC 3000 analyser (Biotronik). SDS gel electrophoresisfollowed standard protocols. Edman degradation of electroblotted pro-teins was performed on a Procise sequencer (Applied Biosystem)according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

fAbstract The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of large
proteins in membranes and are able to transport a variety of compounds throughmembranes against steep concentration gradients at the cost of ATP hydrolysis. Theavailable outline of the human genome contains 48 ABC genes; 16 of these have aknown function and 14 are associated with a deﬁned human disease. Major physio-logical functions of ABC transporters include the transport of lipids, bile salts, toxiccompounds, and peptides for antigen presentation or other purposes. We review thefunctions of mammalian ABC transporters, emphasizing biochemical mechanismsand genetic defects. Our overview illustrates the importance of ABC transportersin human physiology, toxicology, pharmacology, and disease. We focus on threetopics: (a) ABC transporters transporting drugs (xenotoxins) and drug conjugates.
(b) Mammalian secretory epithelia using ABC transporters to excrete a large number
ofsubstances,sometimesagainstasteepconcentrationgradient.Severalinbornerrorsin liver metabolism are due to mutations in one of the genes for these pumps; theseare discussed. ( c) A rapidly increasing number of ABC transporters are found to play
a role in lipid transport. Defects in each of these transporters are involved in humaninborn or acquired diseases.

INTRODUCTION
The name ABC transporters was introduced in 1992 by Chris Higgins in a
memorable review (1). The designation ABC was based on the highly conservedATP-binding cassette, the most characteristic feature of the superfamily. Traf ﬁc
ATPases and P-glycoproteins (Pgps) are other names used for this family. An
inventoryofall48knownandputativehumanABCtransporters(2)canbefoundon the Web site of M. Mu ¨ller, University of Wageningen, The Netherlands (2a).
Table 1 lists the 24 ABC transporters with known function or involvement indisease,whicharediscussedinthisreview.Thecutoffissomewhatarbitrary.Weinclude transporters like ABCB6, for which the function is surmised rather thanknown, and we have omitted transporters for which a function will probably befound before this chapter is published.
We have omitted three well-characterized ABC transporters, ABCC7 –9,
because they are not known to mediate any uphill transport. ABCC7 (CFTR) isa chloride channel, and channels are not transporters. Valverde et al. (3) reportedevidence in 1992 that P-glycoprotein can exist in two states, as drug transporterand as chloride channel. On this basis, Higgins (1, 4) raised the question ofwhether CFTR “might also be bifunctional, with a transport function yet to be
identiﬁed.”Subsequent work has shown, however, that P-glycoprotein is not a
chloride channel (5, 6) and has failed to identify a transport function for CFTR.Hence, CFTR is not discussed here. ABCC8 and 9 (SUR1 and 2), the sulfonyl-ureareceptors,aretheATP-sensingsubunitsofacomplexpotassiumchannelandare not known to transport anything.
The subunit structure of ABC transporters varies, as shown in Figure 1. The
basic structure, as found in P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), is thought to consist of 12538

transmembrane segments and two ATP-binding sites in a protein of about 1300
amino acids. This basic structure may be assembled from two equal (ABCG2) orunequal (ABCG5 and 8) halves. Some ABC transporters (e.g., MRP1) haveadditional domains and are even larger than P-glycoprotein. How ABC trans-porters work is still not known in detail. Models for the transport mechanism arebrieﬂy reviewed here.
This chapter focuses on four overlapping topics, emphasizing biochemical
mechanisms, genetic defects, and regulatory mechanisms:
1. ABC transporters play a role in the transport of drugs (xenotoxins) and
drug conjugates. Classically this role is exempli ﬁed by MDR1 P-glycoprotein,
MRP1 (the multidrug resistance protein 1, ABCC1), or BCRP1 (MXR, ABCP,
ABCG2), which can cause multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. It has
become clear that these transporters can play an important role in preventing theuptake of toxic compounds, including many drugs and food components, fromthe gut into the body, and in protecting vital structures in the body, such as thebrain,thecerebrospinal ﬂuid,thetestis,andthefetus,againsttoxinsthatenterthe
body.Manydrugsaredetoxi ﬁedbyconjugationwithglutathione,glucuronate,or
sulfate, which results in acidic charged conjugates that cannot diffuse throughcell membranes. Members of the MRP family mediate the export of theseconjugates. Two members of the family, MRP4 (ABCC4) and MRP5 (ABCC5),can transport cyclic nucleotides and nucleotide analogs; these transporters mightcontribute to resistance against base and nucleoside analogs used in the chemo-therapy of cancer and viral disease.
2. Mammalian secretory epithelia use ABC transporters to excrete endoge-
nous metabolites, sometimes against a steep concentration gradient. In the liverthese compounds include bile salts (transported by BSEP, the bile salt exportpump, ABCB11), phosphatidylcholine (MDR3 P-glycoprotein, ABCB4), biliru-bin glucuronides (MRP2, ABCC2), and drugs (MDR1 P-glycoprotein, ABCB1).The physiological functions of these pumps are discussed.
3. An increasing number of human inborn diseases are found to be caused by
defectsinABCtransportergenes;wediscussthese.Table1providesasummary.
4. Many mammalian ABC transporters are under tight transcriptional regu-
lation by nuclear receptors. This is especially the case for the lipid transportersbut also for MDR1 and MRP2. The mechanisms of regulation and their impor-tance for physiology are discussed.
SpacelimitationsprecludethediscussionofotherimportantfunctionsofABC
transporters, such as peptide transport. The drug-transporting P-glycoproteins(ABCB1) are excellent transporters of hydrophobic peptides, such as gramicidinD or cyclosporin A (7, 8). A heterodimeric ABC transporter, the transporterassociated with antigen processing (TAP) transports peptides for antigen presen-tation (9), and an ABC transporter related to TAP have been found to exportpeptides from mitochondria (10).
Important information on the function of ABC transporters has been deduced
from genetic defects, either in humans or in knockout (KO) mice, and we make539

STRUCTURE OF ABC TRANSPORTERS
ABC transporters are large membrane proteins and it has been technically
difﬁcult to get crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis. Recently this
problem was solved by Chang & Roth (29) for MsbA, a bacterial homolog of amultidrug resistance transporter from Escherichia coli. MsbA is a lipid trans-
porterbutiscloselyrelatedtoLmrAfrom Lactococcuslactis, whichfunctionsas
a multidrug transporter. The substrate speci ﬁcities of LmrA and Pgp (ABCB1)
are similar (30), and if LmrA is introduced into animal cells it confers multidrugresistance,likePgp(31).Thehighlevelsofsequence,topological,andfunctionalsimilarity between LmrA and Pgp make it likely that there is also structuralsimilarity between the bacterial transporters and Pgp (32), even though MsbAand LmrA are both half-size ABC transporters functioning as homodimers.
Chang & Roth (29) succeeded in crystallizing the MsbA homodimer in the
detergent dodecyl-
/H9251-D-maltoside in the presence of OsCl3. Their structure has a
conelike transmembrane domain with the top of the cone pointing out of the cell.This domain contains 12 transmembrane
/H9251-helices, con ﬁrming the commonly
accepted structure for Pgp (33) and refuting a recently proposed alternative (34,
35). The structure looks very different from the structure of Pgp deduced fromelectron micrographs by Rosenberg et al. (36), however, which looks like a10-nmﬂowerﬂoating in the membrane and facing out. The Rosenberg structure
has a large central pore that is closed at the cytoplasmic face of the membraneand forms an aqueous chamber within the membrane. In contrast, the Chang-Roth structure is open at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and not at theexoplasmic side. The structure also has a central chamber, easily accessible bysubstrate from the inner lea ﬂet of the membrane, while excluding substrate from
the outer lea ﬂet. This is in full agreement with biochemical studies on Pgp and
LmrA (see below).
The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of MsbA are remarkably far from
the membrane and connected to the membrane domain by a third domain, theintracellular domain. The NBD structure is not fully visible in the crystalstructure, but in the modeled structure the two NBDs are rather far apart. This isdifﬁcult to reconcile with the kinetic and spectroscopic studies that indicate that
the ATPase domains of ABC transporters are closely interacting and adjacent inspace (see below). Interacting ATP-binding sites are clearly found in thestructures of two distant relatives of ABC transporters, the Rad50 ATPaseinvolved in double-strand break repair (37) and the ArsAB arsenite/antimonitepumpofE.coli(38).Inthe3-DstructureoftheATPasepart(ArsA)ofthepump
thetwoATP-bindingsitesareveryclosetogether.Infact,eachATP-bindingsiteis made up of residues from both domains of ArsA.
How the transmembrane segments of ABC transporters form the postulated
transmembrane pore is controversial. Looking at P-glycoprotein one wouldexpect a head-tail, head-tail structure with transmembrane segment (TMS) 1close to 12, and 6 close to 7. This simple arrangement may not be correct,545

however. Loo & Clarke (39) constructed an active cysteineless version of the
human MDR1 Pgp and made a systematic study of the structure and function ofthis transporter by introducing cysteines at de ﬁned positions in the molecule
[reviewed in (33)]. In cross-linking studies they found interaction of TMS 6 withTMS 10, 11, and 12, and interaction of 12 with 4, 5, and 6 (40). On this basis,they propose a structure in which the two halves of Pgp are displaced to allow 4,5, 6 to lie opposite 10, 11, 12. An even more radical displacement has beendeducedfromadifferentsetofexperimentsforTAPbyVosetal.(41),whothinkthat the two subunits of TAP interact in a head-head, tail-tail fashion [see also(42)]. Such a con ﬁguration in Pgp would also be compatible with the results of
Loo & Clarke (40).
In contrast, the MbsA structure (29) shows a head-tail, head-tail arrangement
for the two monomers but an unusual one, as in each monomer TMS 1 isjuxtaposed to 6. It should be stressed, however, that the crystal form is only oneconformation of a structure that must undergo considerable rearrangementsduring the catalytic cycle. Reits et al. (43) have shown that the lateral mobilityof TAP in the membrane increases substantially when the protein becomesinactive and decreases again when it pumps peptides. This implies majorstructural rearrangements. Higgins & Linton (32) mention unpublished resultsindicatingasubstantiallateralrepackingofthetransmembranehelicesduringthecatalytic cycle. Obviously, the landmark structure of Chang & Roth (29) wasobtained under rather unusual conditions, without membrane lipids, adeninenucleotides, or substrate. Undoubtedly, an avalanche of additional structuralinformation will follow, which will provide a test for some of the models fortransporter function now available (29, 32, 38).
HOW DO ABC TRANSPORTERS WORK?
ABC transporters are versatile. They are used in nature to transport a large rangeof compounds out of cells. Kinetic experiments and directed mutagenesis havegenerated a large volume of data that delineate key features of the modusoperandi of ABC transporters. A review of these data is beyond the scope of thischapter. Here we summarize some general principles. The most extensive workhas been done on Pgp, but the recent experiments on LmrA (see above) are alsoof interest. As LmrA is a half-size ABC transporter functioning as a homodimer,this implies that the two halves of Pgp must also have an equivalent function.
Inactivation of one of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of Pgp, by
amino acid substitution or by nucleotide trapping in the presence of vanadate,blocks drug transport and even ATP hydrolysis by the unaffected NBD. Thisshows that the two interact strongly and cannot hydrolyze Mg-ATP indepen-dently. A model in which the two NBDs alternate in ATP hydrolysis during thecatalyticcycleofPgpwasproposedbySenioretal.(44).Thiscanbegeneralizedto CFTR (45), to the TAP1/2 heterodimer (46), and to the bacterial LmrA546

homodimer(47),andhasbeenre ﬁnedbyrecentworkinseverallabs(33,48 –54).
Nothing is simple in the world of ABC transporters, however, as rather differentresults were obtained with another drug transporter, MRP1 (55, 56). The twoNBDsinMRP1areclearlynonequivalent.ThemoststrikingdifferencewithPgpis that inactivation of NBD1 does not completely eliminate drug transport,whereas inactivation of NBD2 does (55). This is obviously incompatible with amodel in which drug transport is dependent on alternating ATP hydrolysis byNBD1 and 2, as favored for Pgp.
Thereisstilldoubtaboutthepositionandnumberofsubstrate-bindingsitesin
ABC transporters, such as Pgp. Older studies had shown that mutations scatteredthroughtheentireproteinmayaffectsubstratespeci ﬁcity.Substratescross-linked
onto Pgp mainly label TMS 5, 6, 11, and 12, which suggests that these segmentsare part of the drug-binding site(s) [reviewed in (57, 58)]. Using a verapamilanalog that can be coupled to single cysteines introduced into a cysteinelessversion of Pgp, recent studies show targeting of TMS 4, 6, 10, 11, and 12 (59).The NBDs are not required for drug binding (33, 60).
Van Veen et al. (47) ﬁnd two vinblastine-binding sites on the LmrA
homodimer, a high-af ﬁnity site on the cytoplasmic side and a low-af ﬁnity site on
the extracellular side. They present an alternating two-site (two-cylinder engine)mechanism in which each subunit alternates between the high-af ﬁnity and the
low-afﬁnity conformation. This elegant model is a simpli ﬁcation of the situation
in Pgp, where there is compelling evidence for at least two substrate-bindingsites, which differ in substrate speci ﬁcity. These can interact in a positively
cooperativemanner(61 –63).Thereisevenevidenceforathirddrug-bindingsite
(64) and for drug-binding sites with allosteric effects on drug transport (31, 65).
Hydrophobicsubstratesareprobablytakenfromtheinnerlea ﬂetoftheplasma

transfers substrate directly into the extracellular medium (68, 70).

Pgp pump ample opportunity to deal with the in ﬂux (71, 72). The rate of
spontaneous ﬂip-ﬂop is relevant, because estimates of the turnover number of
Pgp substrates range from 1 to 10 s/H110021, which is low (73, 74).
The substrate speci ﬁcity of drug-transporting Pgps is wide, but still not
completely de ﬁned for technical reasons. In most studies, cells are transfected
with a Pgp gene construct and the drug resistance of the transfected cell relativeto its parent is determined. If several independent transfected cell lines arecompared, this assay system is direct and reliable, but relatively insensitive.Substrates that enter cells faster than Pgp can pump them out are missed. A casein point is methotrexate (MTX), a hydrophilic negatively charged drug, longthought to be the prototype of a drug not touched by Pgp. However, cells in
which MTX enters at a very low rate because its main import route is lackingcould readily be made MTX resistant by introducing Pgp (75). The sensitivity ofthe transfected cell system is also compromised by the presence of endogenouslevels of Pgp and other drug transporters in nontransfected cells. This isillustrated by the fact that mouse ﬁbroblasts from KO mice lacking drug-
transporting Pgps and MRP1 were 10- to 20-fold more sensitive to paclitaxel,Vincaalkaloids, and epipodophyllotoxins than their wild-type counterparts (76).
A more sensitive assay system for drugs transported by Pgp is provided by
stable kidney cell lines that can be grown as monolayers on a ﬁlter, separating a
basal and an apical compartment (77). Transporters introduced in these cells bytransfection properly route to the apical or the basolateral membrane of the cell,which allows quantitative measurements of rates of drug transport (78 –84). This
system was used, for instance, to demonstrate that valspodar (PSC833), anefﬁcientinhibitorofPgp,isalsotransportedbyPgpatalowrate,con ﬁrmingthat
good inhibitors of Pgp are usually also substrates (85). The best inhibitors mayhave such a high af ﬁnity for Pgp that their off rate is too low to detect transport.
The kidney monolayer system is also marred by endogenous transporters (whichmay show some clonal variation in expression, further complicating transportanalysis) and by the fact that for some substrates, such as vincristine, entry intothe cell may be rate-limiting.
Drug transport has also been studied in membrane vesicles isolated from
disrupted cells. Depending on the cell type and conditions of the isolationprocedure, different ratios of right-side-out and inside-out vesicles can beobtained. Inside-out vesicles can be used to study ATP-dependent transportdirectly, which allows the determination of kinetic parameters. With Pgp thissystem has not been so useful, as most substrates are rather hydrophobic anddiffuse back out. In addition, these hydrophobic substrates display extensivenonspeciﬁc binding to the membranes, thereby dramatically decreasing the
signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, vesicular transport has been an important toolfor studying substrate speci ﬁcity of the MRPs, ABC transporters that transport
anionic hydrophilic substrates. In addition to these direct transport assays, Pgpand MRPs have also been studied extensively by various indirect methods, suchas measuring substrate binding, nucleotide trapping, and ATPase activity. The548

advantages and pitfalls of these indirect methods have been reviewed (63) and
are not discussed here.
The picture emerging from of all these studies is that Pgp is an omnivore,
transporting a vast range of drugs. The preference is for large amphipathicmolecules that are neutral or weakly basic, but if pushed, Pgp can also inef ﬁ-
cientlyhandleananionichighlychargedcompound,suchasMTX.Itisthereforehardlysurprisingthatithasprovendif ﬁculttodeﬁnetheelementscommontoall
Pgp substrates. Hydrophobicity, planar aromatic rings, and the presence oftertiary amino groups favor interaction with Pgp, but no highly conservedelements of recognition have been found [reviewed in (25, 86 –88)]. How a
single protein can accommodate so many different structures has long been amystery.Someoftheprinciplesinvolvedareillustratedbythestructuralanalysisof the bacterial transcription regulator BmrR, a soluble protein that can tightlybind very different cationic drugs. Key elements in binding are a central ﬂexible
cavity within the protein; the cavity contains a negatively charged residue in ahydrophobic environment. The ﬂexibility of the cavity allows multiple Van der
Waals contacts and stacking interactions that do not require precise positioningof the ligand, as is the case for hydrogen bonding (89, 90). If the ligand entersfromtheinnerlea ﬂetofthemembrane,stericrequirementscanbeimposedbythe
protein to prevent entry of natural membrane lipids. Although this model is notdirectly applicable to Pgp, it has helped to explain some of the principles ofpromiscuous substrate binding.
P-Glycoprotein in the Defense Against Drugs/Xenotoxins
There is little doubt that Pgp is a key player in the defense of the body againstamphipathic xenotoxins. In the gut mucosa it prevents entry of toxins into thebody; in the blood-brain barrier, placental trophoblasts, testis, and bone marrowit provides protection of vital body parts; and in the gut, liver, and kidney Pgphelps to eliminate toxins from the body. The wide range of toxic compoundstransported by Pgp makes it a guardian for all seasons. The downside is that Pgpcanalsointerferewiththedeliveryofdrugstotargettissues,butthedevelopmentof potent Pgp inhibitors with low toxicity has opened up new ways to overcomethis undesirable interference of Pgp with medical treatment.
Although there are many examples in the older literature of Pgp defense
functions, the detailed analysis of these functions was greatly simpli ﬁed by the
generation of Pgp KO mice (91 –93). Mice have two Abcb1-type drug transport-
ers, known as the products of genes Mdr1a (Mdr3) andMdr1b (Mdr1), that
appear to do the job of a single Pgp, the MDR1 Pgp (ABCB1) in humans. TheMdr1a Pgp is the only Pgp present in the gut and in the blood-brain barrier, andtheMdr1a(/H11002//H11002) mice have been used extensively to study the effect of Pgp on
oral availability and brain penetration of drugs. The Mdr1b(/H11002//H11002) mice have
hardly been used for pharmacological studies, since the Mdr1a/1b (/H11002//H11002) mice
and the triple KO mice (94, 95), additionally defective in Mrp1, were available.The KO mice have no abnormalities as long as they are not exposed to drugs.549

This may depend somewhat on the environment, however, as an in ﬂammatory

Recent experiments on the defense function of Pgps have concentrated on
three drug barriers: the gut mucosa, the blood-brain barrier, and the maternal-fetal barrier.
BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER Thisbarrierconsistsoftheendothelialcellsofthebrain
capillaries, which are linked together by tight junctions and lack the holes foundin capillaries elsewhere in the body. Hence, drugs getting into the brain have topass the endothelial cells and get by the Pgp present at high level in the apicalmembrane of these cells (98). Many observations in the older literature suggesta contribution of Pgp to the blood-brain barrier [reviewed in (99 –102)], but the
importance of Pgp did not become clear until the Mdr1a(/H11002//H11002) mice were
analyzed. These mice were 100-fold more sensitive to the neurotoxic pesticideivermectin, a good Pgp substrate (78), and accumulated 100-fold more ivermec-tin in their brains than wild-type mice (92). Subsequent work has demonstratedthat the brain accumulation of a large range of drugs is strongly decreased byP-glycoprotein. These include anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, paclitaxel,and vincristine; cardiac drugs, such as digoxin and quinidine; antidiarrheal drugssuch as loperamide; antiemetics, such as ondansetron and domperidone; and theimmunosuppressant cyclosporin A (98, 101, 103, 104). In fact, any good Pgpsubstrate is severely affected, unless it diffuses rather rapidly through mem-branes, like dexamethasone, which is strongly affected when it is at lowconcentrations (105), but much less affected at high concentrations (78). Theinterest in Pgp in the blood-brain barrier was further stimulated by the discoverythat the HIV protease inhibitors indinavir, nel ﬁnavir, and saquinavir are Pgp
substrates and that Pgp limits the penetration of these drugs into the brain (106,107). Pgp might also affect the treatment of primary brain tumors with an intact
brain-type vasculature (101, 108, 109). A problem is that the available Pgpinhibitors seem unable to fully inhibit the high concentrations of Pgp in theblood-brain barrier (14, 85, 110 –113). We expect this problem to be solved by
the development of more effective Pgp inhibitors.
The blood capillaries of the inner ear are similar in structure and barrier
function to the capillaries in the brain and also contain Pgp. Zhang et al. (114)have shown that the absence of Pgp in the Mdr1a(/H11002//H11002) mice results in a
dysfunction of the blood –inner ear barrier, and they conclude that the Pgp in this
barrier prevents the ototoxicity that could be caused by drugs that are Pgpsubstrates.550

P-GLYCOPROTEIN AND THE MATERNAL-FETAL BARRIER In 1998, Lankas et al.
(115) discovered that the naturally occurring Mdr1a(/H11002//H11002) mutants of the CF-1
mouse stock display an enhanced sensitivity to the teratogenic effects of thepesticide avermectin. They found that the Mdr1a Pgp (Abcb1, Mdr3) is presentinthefetus-derivedepithelialcellsthatmakeuptheexchangeborderbetweenthefetal and maternal circulation. Pgp in the apical border of these cells faces thematernalcirculationandisoptimallyplacedtoprotectthefetusagainstincomingamphipathic toxins.
This work was extended by Smit et al. (116) in the Mdr1a/1b (/H11002//H11002) mice.
They found that digoxin, saquinavir, or paclitaxel given intravenously to preg-nant mother mice penetrated the ( /H11002//H11002) fetuses more effectively than ( /H11001//H11001)
fetuses. A similar increase in drug penetration was obtained by inhibitingplacental Pgp with the Pgp inhibitors PSC833 or GG918. These striking resultsshow that “Pgp makes a major contribution to yet another biological important
protective barrier ”(116). It is now clear that in mice the Mdr1a isoform is the
major one in placenta (93, 115). The high Mdr1bRNA levels found in placenta
by Croop et al. (117) must have been due to a misinterpretation.
P-GLYCOPROTEIN AND ORAL AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS Pgp was known to be
present in the apical membranes of the mucosal cells of the gut from the earlystudies using immunohistochemistry, but until 1996 the idea that Pgp mightactually do something in that location and interfere with the uptake of amphi-pathic drugs from the gut was mainly based on studies with Pgp inhibitors(118–120). Mayer et al. (121) then found that the predominantly fecal excretion
of digoxin in wild-type mice shifted toward urinary excretion in the Mdr1a
(/H11002//H11002) mice. They also found that intravenously injected digoxin is excreted
directlyintothegutinwild-typemice(16%ofadministereddosein90minutes),but hardly at all (2%) in the KO mice.
This result showed that Pgp can affect the oral availability of Pgp substrate
drugs, and it suggested that paclitaxel (taxol), an excellent Pgp substrate that hasto be given intravenously to patients because of its very poor oral availability,mightbepreventedfromenteringthebodyfromthegutbyPgp.Thiswasveri ﬁed
by Sparreboom et al. (122). They showed that the oral availability of paclitaxel
went from 11% in wild-type mice to 35% in Mdr1a(/H11002//H11002) mice. Even more
striking was the reduction in fecal excretion of an oral dose of paclitaxel from87% in wild-type mice to /H110213% in the KO mice, which probably represents the
combined intestinal and biliary excretion. Inhibition of Pgp in wild-type micewith PSC833 resulted in a dramatic ten-fold increase in the availability ofpaclitaxel (123), presumably because the PSC833 affected not only the uptake ofpaclitaxel from the gut but also metabolism of it, as paclitaxel and cyclosporinsare both substrates for the P450 3A4 isoenzymes. The translation of these resultsfrom mice to new treatment modalities for human patients is in full swing (124).The principle has been proven to work in human patients, both for paclitaxel551

intestinal Pgp (128).
Thereareothercandidatedrugsandothertransportersforwhichthisprinciple
should work, as MRP2 and BCRP are also present in the apical membrane of theenterocyte. It should also be realized that the oral availability of a range of drugscould be affected by variations in Pgp activity, either because of Pgp polymor-phisms (see below) or because of variations in dietary components that caninhibitPgp,suchasunidenti ﬁedcomponentsofgrapefruitjuice.Furthermore,the
expression of MDR1is modulated by many drugs and toxins via the nuclear
receptor SXR and possibly others. An important example is paclitaxel, whichinduces expression of both CYP3AandMDR1,thereby inducing its own
metabolism and excretion (see below).
The Role of P-Glycoprotein in Clinical Anticancer
Drug Resistance
It is now 25 years since P-glycoprotein was discovered. Reliable methods are
available to detect the presence of P-glycoprotein in tumor samples by immu-nohistochemistry or functional tests (129). Potent, relatively nontoxic inhibitorsof P-glycoprotein have been developed; these can virtually eliminate the effectsof P-glycoprotein on drug accumulation in cells in model systems. Still there isno agreement on the usefulness of P-glycoprotein blockers in the treatment ofhuman tumors containing Pgp. Four factors contribute to this unsatisfactory stateof affairs:
1. It has been dif ﬁcult to determine what amounts of Pgp are signi ﬁcant and
in which cells they are localized. This is necessary in order to focus trials withreversal agents on tumors in which Pgp makes a real contribution to resistance.The problem is illustrated by a recent reinvestigation of the variable resultspublished for Pgp in breast cancer. Faneyte et al. (130) showed by immunohis-tochemistry that the Pgp in these tumors is present only in the variable numberof inﬁltrating macrophages and T cells and not in the tumor cells.
2. The early clinical trials with MDR reversal agents were done with drugs,
such as verapamil, that inhibit Pgp rather poorly at clinically achievable dose.With hindsight, this makes the negative early trials with reversal agents uninter-pretable. Even PSC833 (valspodar), the reversal agent used most in recentclinical trials, may not be able to completely block Pgp in all nooks and cornersof the body (85), as pointed out before.
3. Reversal agents also affect systemic drug disposition, either by decreasing
drug elimination via Pgp, or by interfering with drug metabolism via the P450system.

4.Tumorsuse whatever drug resistance mechanisms are available, and it is
nowabundantlyclearthatPgpisnottheonlydefenseavailable,noreventheonlydrug transporter in tumors. It is not easy to determine to what extent resistanceof a given tumor is due to Pgp, or due to other resistance mechanisms. Withincreasing insight into drug resistance mechanisms and the rapidly increasingability to analyze genetic alterations in tumors in detail, this problem shouldeventually be solved.
The potential contribution of Pgp to resistance in human cancer patients
cannotyetbeassessed(134 –138).Apriori,itisunlikelythatsometumorswould
not use such a wonderful mechanism to defend themselves against drugs, andthere is ample anecdotal evidence for a role of P-glycoprotein in drug resistance(134, 139, 140). Compelling evidence for a contribution of Pgp to survival ofmyeloma tumor cells comes from the work of Mickley et al. (141). Theyanalyzed the nature of the overexpressed MDR1allele(s) in myeloma cells from
patients in which the two alleles present could be distinguished by a polymor-phism. In each case where MDR1was overexpressed, only a single allele was
found to be overexpressed. This shows that MDR1 Pgp does play a role inclinical resistance in myeloma. No other reasonable mechanism would consis-tently select for overexpression of a single MDR1allele. A similar analysis in
patients with acute myeloid leukemia was negative (142). This suggests thatdifferentialexpressionofthetwoPgpallelesmightbeagoodcriterionforpatientselection in future trials with Pgp blockers.
Physiological Substrates of P-Glycoprotein
Mice lacking the major drug-transporting Pgps, Mdr1a and b, are normal andfertile in a protected environment (93). This shows that these transporters haveno essential function in physiology other than defending the body againstxenotoxins. Pgps are good at transporting lipid analogs (81, 143, 144), however,and the ABCB4-type Pgps are dedicated phosphatidylcholine (PC) translocators(91). This has raised the question of whether the drug-transporting Pgps mightnot do small lipid jobs on the side in normal lipid traf ﬁcking [an issue reviewed
in more detail in (15, 145)].
The fact that Mdr1 Pgp (ABCB1) does not functionally replace Mdr2
(ABCB4) in the Mdr2 knockout model predicts that natural PC is not a substratefor MDR1 Pgp (91), but a direct test must still be done to prove this. There isindirect evidence for transport by MDR Pgp of two other long-chain membranelipids, sphingomyelin (146) and glucosylceramide (147), and a short-chain lipid,platelet-activating factor (148, 149).
Dexamethasone, an arti ﬁcial steroid, is effectively transported by Pgp, which
has raised the question of whether Pgp might also transport endogenous steroids.MDR1 Pgp is present at high concentration in the human adrenal cortex, whichhas prompted speculations about an essential role of drug-transporting Pgps incortical hormone transport (150, 151). It should be noted, however, that rat andhamster adrenals do not have this high adrenal level of Pgp (152 –155) and that553

theMdr1a/1b (/H11002//H11002) mouse has no signs of adrenal or genital insuf ﬁciency (93).
The Pgp in the human adrenals may therefore either be accidental or re ﬂect the
exposure of primates to toxins especially deleterious to the adrenal cortex.Whether cholesterol, the major sterol in mammalian membrane, is translocatedby Pgp (156, 157) is doubtful in our opinion and requires con ﬁrmation by direct
transport experiments, as pointed out by Johnstone et al. (151). This also holdsfor the postulated role of Pgp in cholesterol esteri ﬁcation (158, 159).
Five other physiological functions have been attributed to the drug-transport-
ingPgps(151):transportofcytokines,particularlyinterleukin2(IL-2),IL-4,andgamma interferon (IFN-
/H9253) (160, 161); increased self-renewal and decreased
differentiationofhematopoieticstemcells(162);migrationofantigen-presentingdendritic cells and T lymphocytes (163); inhibition of alloantigen-dependent, butnot mitogen-dependent, T-cell activation (164); and inhibition of apoptosis[reviewed in (151)], but not cytolysis by pore-forming proteins (165, 166). Theevidence for these physiological functions rests mainly on the effects of Pgpinhibitors, gross overexpression of a Pgp gene, or the effects of anti-Pgpantibodies, and remains the subject of lively discussions (167).

Man-made antibodies 
Greg Winter & Cesar Milstein 
Monoclonal antibodies can now be genetically engineered and endowed with new properties. In the future, 
gene technology could enable antigen-binding fragments to be made by exploiting repertoires of variable 
domain genes derived from immunized animals and expressed in bacteria. How readily can this approach 
be extended to production of' in vitro' repertoires of variable domain genes, and obviate the immunization 
of animals? 
IN 1975 a method was described for making cell lines that secrete 
a single species of antibody (monoclonal antibody) with the 
desired specificity to antigen 1• The technique-'hybridoma tech­
nology'-proved to be general, and a wide range of monoclonal 
antibodies have been made which bind to protein, carbohydrate, 
nucleic acids and hapten antigens, and which even have catalytic 
activities2·3, leading to many practical applications for mono­
clonal antibodies in research and human health-care4-7 and to 
patent disputes8• The technology has been improved over the 
years, particularly by the preselection of antigen-binding B cells9 
and by screening with antigen-coated filters10• 
Hybridoma technology was first extended by somatic cell 
genetics, which allowed antibody mutants to be selected11•12, 
their functional properties to be changed by switching heavy 
chain constant regions13 and antibodies to be made with dual 
specificity 14• Gene technology later revolutionized this potential 
as antibody genes could now be altered to order. New vistas 
appeared, reviving the forgotten excitement of the old discipline 
of immunochemistry of antibodies. Initially antibody genes were 
taken from hybridomas, cloned into plasmid vectors and 
expressed as complete antibodies in mammalian cells15•16 or as 
fragments in bacteria 11-20. The ready manipulation of the genes 
by cutting and pasting of restriction fragments, or by site­
directed mutagenesis, has allowed the construction of new anti­
body reagents and fine mapping of antibody structure-function 
relationships. 
More recently a new approach has been proposed with the 
potential to bypass hybridomas21•22• Antibody genes are cloned 
directly from lymphocytes of immunized animals and expressed 
in bacteria, and the antibody products are screened for binding 
to antigen23•24. As does hybridoma technology, the process relies 
on animal immunization to give rise to many antigen-specific 
cells. In the animal, antibodies of low affinity are first produced 
by antigen-induced proliferation of cells, and then higher affinity 
variants are generated by point mutation and selection. 
Hybridoma technology can immortalize these cells; gene tech­
nology can immortalize their genes. In both cases, however, it 
is animals that 'invent' the new molecules . 
Looking ahead, can we even bypass animals and make new 
antibodies in vitro25? Two current strategies recapitulate the 
great immunological controversy of the 1950s-instruction ver­
sus selection26• The selectionists are making naive repertoires 
of antibody genes and selecting those with antigen-binding 
activity, so mimicking nature. The modern instructionists are 
using computer graphic techniques to build specific antigen­
binding sites. Here we shall describe the manipulations that 
have already produced some designer antibodies of practical 
value, and discuss other possibilities for improving on nature. 
Starting with hybridomas 
The antibody (IgG) is a Y-shaped molecule, in which the 
domains forming the tips of the arms bind to antigen and those 
forming the stem are responsible for triggering effector functions 
that eliminate the antigen. The domain structure of the molecule 
makes it particularly accessible to protein engineering, as func-
NATURE · VOL 349 · 24 JANUARY 1991 tional domains carrying antigen-binding activities (Fv, Fab frag­
ments) or effector functions (Fe fragments) can be used separ­
ately as fragments, or swapped between antibodies27•28 (see Fig. 
1 and legend). Furthermore, the rigid ,a-sheet framework struc­
ture of the variable (V) domains, surmounted with antigen­
binding loops, allows the transplanting of binding sites from 
one antibody to another29• These structural features have 
spawned a range of designer antibodies, from complete anti­
bodies, capable of destorying pathogens or tumour cells through 
their natural effector mechanisms, to antigen-binding fragments 
that can be used to target attached toxins, or for diagnosis 
though bound radioisotopes (Fig. 2). 
Antibodies kill cells by triggering the complement cascade at 
the cell surface, with consequent lysis, or by binding to receptors 
on the surface of specialized effector cells, such as phagocytes 
or killer cells and triggering phagocytosis or antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytolysis. The potential of an antibody in lysis is 
determined mainly by the class of the constant (C) domains 
(isotype). This has been dissected by making chimaeric anti­
bodies, in which the variable domains of a rodent antibody are 
attached to the constant domains of human -y isotypes. The 
human -yl isotype emerges as being highly effective in both 
complement and cell-mediated killing, and therefore the most 
suitable for therapeutic use against pathogens or tumour 
cells30•31. Conversely, the inactive human -y4 isotype may be 
more suitable for diagnostic imaging, or for blocking a damaging 
immune or allergic response by binding to the antigen and thus 
competing with destructive antibodies32• Analysis of the roles 
of individual amino-acid residues should permit the engineering 
of variants of a single antibody isotype with differing effector 
mechanisms. Thus the binding sites for the high-affinity receptor 
(FcRI) include the lower hinge region of the antibody33, and 
the 'core' binding site for the first component of complement is 
a strand of /3 sheet in the second heavy chain constant (CH2) 
domain34 (Fig. 1). 
Although some rodent antibodies (particularly the mouse -y2a 
and rat -y2b isotypes), can trigger human effector mechanisms, 
they are immunogenic in human therapy. In view of the difficul­
ties of making human monoclonal antibodies directly (see later), 
rodent antibodies have been 'humanized' by linking rodent 
variable regions and human constant regions28 ( chimaeric anti­
bodies, Fig. 2). This reduces the immunogenicity of the antibody 
as shown in clinical trials35. But residual immunogenicity is 
retained (at least in part) by virtue of the foreign V-region 
framework36. 
A more complete way of humanizing rodent antibodies 
includes the replacement of the V-region framework ('reshaped' 
antibodies, Fig. 2). It relies on the architecture of V domains as 
a framework of /3 sheets topped with antigen-binding loops (see 
ref. 37 and Fig. l). By grafting the loops, the antigen-binding 
site can be transferred from rodent to human antibody29•31•38•39• 
The technique was used to humanize a rat therapeutic antibody 
directed against mature human Ieukocytes31 which proved clini­
cally effective in destroying a large mass of tumour in two 
patients40. But reshaping requires that the different framework 
293 © 1991Nature  Publishing GroupREVIEW ARTICLE 
regions are structurally conserved, both in the orientations of 
the two J3 sheets of each domain and in the packing of heavy 
chain variable (VH) and light chain variable (VL) domains 
together; that the hypervariable loops make the majority of 
contacts with antigen; and that the loops are supported in a 
similar way by the underlying /3-sheet framework. Although 
these are likely to be true for some antibodies, the restitution 
of key contacts between loops and framework has proved 
294 necessary in others. Simple molecular modelling can help iden­
tify contacts and design small changes to optimize affinities31•41. 
Although natural effector functions are powerful, antibodies 
can also be engineered to recruit other effector functions. For 
example, by generating antibodies whose antigen-binding sites 
have dual specificity for a target cell and an effector such as a 
toxin. Such 'hybrid hybridomas' are made by fusion of 
hybridomas of two-different specificities14•42, each of the two 
FIG. 1 Antibody structure. The antibody (lgG) consists of four 
chains, two heavy (H) and two light (L), which in turn are built 
by stringing together domains of similar architecture. Each 
chain is paired with another chain by lateral packing of the 
domains and also by at least one disulphide bond. Each domain 
consists of two /3 sheets which pack together to form a 
sandwich, with exposed loops at the ends of the strands. 
Thus the C domains have three J3 strands in one sheet 
(strands C, F, G) and four strands (strands A, B, D, E) in the 
other. The V domains have an extra two strands in one sheet 
(C, C', C"", F, G). This framework is highly conserved in different 
antibodies. The three loops at the top of the V domain are 
hypervariable in sequence and fashion the antigen-binding 
site37. Despite the sequence hypervariability, most of the 
antigen-binding loops have a small repertoire of main-chain 
conformations. The antibody can be proteolytically cleaved 
at the flexible hinge region, yielding Fab fragments which bind 
antigen (tomprising heavy chain VH and CH1 domains, top of 
the hinge and the entire light chain}, and Fe fragments which 
bind to effector functions (comprising lower hinge and heavy 
chain CH2 and CH3 domains}. The model is taken from the 
solved X-ray crystallographic structures of Fab and Fe 
domains of myeloma protein KOL 85, represented according 
to Lesk86 and redrawn by an artist. Each strand of the f3 
sheets has been colour -coded. The f3 sheet defined by the 
A, B, D, E strands is more intensely coloured. The hypervariable 
regions (VH, 1-3; VL, 4-6) are in red; the binding sites for 
high-affinity receptor33, Clq34 and carbohydrate attach-
VH ment site are also marked in red, 
as triangles, circles or squares 
respectively. 
NATURE · VOL 349 · 24 JANUARY 1991 © 1991Nature  Publishing Grouphalves of a single antibody molecule is from one of the two 
parental antibodies, and the molecule therefore carries two 
different antigen-binding sites. Such bispecific antibodies can 
bind both to a cell target (for example in a tumour) and to a 
toxin or cytotoxic T cell43'44
• Novel effector functions can also 
be recruited by fusing gene segments encoding antigen-binding 
sites (as Fe or Fab fragments) to genes encoding toxins45 and 
enzymes27. This can, for example, allow agents such as tissue 
plasminogen activator to be targeted to blood clots through Fab 
binding to fibrin, leading to the local activation of plas­
minogen46. Fusion of antibodies with enzymes may also prove 
invaluable for local activation of prodrugs7·47. Conversely anti­
body Fe fragments can equip other proteins with antibody 
effector functions. For example, CD4 linked to Fe fragments 
binds to viral glycoprotein gp 120 on the surface of cells infected 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and kills the cells 
by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytolysis (ref. 48) (CD4 
immunoadhesin, Fig. 2). 
Complete antibodies (relative molecular mass 150,000 (M, 
15OK)) are large molecules but much smaller fragments can be 
prepared that retain antigen-binding activity. Small fragments 
(M, 12K-5OK) equipped with radioisotopes could be used for 
imaging or therapy and are in some ways particularly attractive 
for use in vivo as they penetrate tissue boundaries more 
effectively49. Fragments are also cleared faster from the serum

and tissues50 and although this may compromise their use as 
targeting agents, it can aid the clearance of toxic drugs, such as 
digoxin, from the circulation51. Small fragments also have 
advantages in fundamental research, for high-resolution X-ray 
crystallographic studies of antigen-binding sites. The size of 
antibodies and flexibility of the hinge connecting Fab arms and 
the Fe domain have prompted crystallographers to turn to Fab 
fragments52 and now Fv fragments53 (Fig. 2). In future we expect 
that fragments will be used extensively as they are readily 
expressed in an active form from genes introduced into 
mammalian27•54 or bacterial cells19·20·23•55. But antibody frag­
ments may require further engineering to eliminate undesirable 
properties. 
For example, Fv fragments are noncovalently associated 
heterodimers of VH and VL domains which may thus dissociate. 
Although some Fv fragments are less prone to dissociation than 
others56, stable Fv fragments can be engineered either by linking 
the domains with a hydrophilic and flexible peptide57·58 to create 
single-chain Fv fragments (scFv, Fig. 2), or by introducing 
disulphide bonds between the domains56. Single VH domains 
(dAb, Fig. 2) with antigen-binding activities23 are likely to 
require more extensive engineering. The domains have an 
exposed hydrophobic surface ( where they normally interact with 
light chain), rendering them 'sticky'. If their properties can be 
improved, for example by introducing hydrophilic residues to 
the interface, these single domains may prove to be the forerun­
ners of a new generation of small recognition molecules. 
Bypassing hybridomas 
Immunization is essential to derive hybridomas secreting high­
affinity antibodies. In the animal these antibodies are produced 
in two stages59·60
• The first stage is fast and leads to the produc­
tion of antibodies of low affinity (1O5-1O7M-1). It involves the

FIG. 3 Organization of V genes. The domain structure of the antibodies is 
mirrored at the level of the gene, as the individual domains are encoded by 
separate exons. In turn, the VH and VL domains are built from separate 
genetic elements, and assembled by DNA rearrangements during lymphocyte 
differentiation. Thus the first and second hypervariable loops are encoded 
by the germ-line V genes, but the third hypervariable loop by the combination 
of V, D and J elements (for the VH domain) and V and J elements (for the 
VL domain). The third hypervariable loop of VH is accordingly the most diverse 
in sequence and backbone conformation and is often the longest of the 
loops. Exon structure is illustrated for the unrearranged and rearranged VH 
genes and is similar (not shown) for VL genes (VK or VA). VH, unrearranged 
or rearranged heavy chain variable region as appropriate; D, D segment; J, 
J segment; CH1, CH2, CH3, first, second and third heavy chain constant exons, 
respectively; h, hinge exon; L, signal sequence; p, immunoglobulin promoter 
(octanucleotide motif). The potential diversity of the mouse primary reper­
toire is huge as a consequence of the combinatorial arrangements of the 
genetic elements. It can be estimated as follows. (1) Diversity due to 
combinatorial integration: 300 V K x 4JK = 1.2 x 103 and 200 VH x 15 D x 
4J=12 x103• (2) Diversity due to junctional alternatives (alternative read­
ings at junction due to differences in reading frame, and lengths of J and 
D segments): V K to JK -3 and VH to D to J -40. (3) Diversity due to N 
segment for heavy chain >10. (4) Hence combined diversity for each chain: 
light chains=3 x103 and heavy chains >5 x106. Conclusion: diversity due 
to combinatorial association of heavy and light chains >1010. Additional 
factor due to somatic mutation > 1030 (see text).

molecules encode antigen-specific immunoglobulin (PL= PH= 10-2), there is -60% probability that 1/104 recombinants will contain one H and one L chain 
encoding any antigen-specific immunoglobulin: most are comprised of artificial combinations, which may or may not specify antigen-binding activity. If there

108 clones will give us a 60% probability of finding the 'original' combination. But regardless of whether they originate from antigen-binding lymphocytes, 
L chains may be capable of complementing the H chains from antigen-specific immunoglobulin. This frequency may be high particularly in primary responses 
and early secondary responses, before extensive diversification through hypermutation, but will depend on the cut-off affinity used in the assay. Taking a

proliferation of cells drawn from the repertoire already available 
at the time of immunization. The potential repertoire is huge 
(> 1010) (Fig. 3 and legend), but at any given time, only a fraction 
of the potential repertoire of a mouse is available through the 
limited number of clones (107 -108) expressing antibodies. 
The second stage produces high-affinity antibodies, starting 
with the genes used in the first stage. Its main tool is the 
hypermutation of these genes followed by selection of those 
cells which produce antibodies of increased affinity. This is a 
darwinian process, involving variation resulting from point 
mutations followed by selection driven by the requirement for 
antigen for cell survival. It is an inheritable process, but only 
at the somatic level among the lymphoid cells of the individual. 
The resulting memory cells seem to be able to undergo new 
rounds of hypermutation and selection following antigenic 
challenge61• 
Th;: rate of mutation approaches 10-3 or 3 x 10-4 mutations 
per base pair per cell division in a more recent estimate60•61•62• 
Mutations are localized to the segment coding for the variable 
portion of the antibody genes. The potential diversity generated 
by hypermutation is astronomical. Even if only the hypervariable 
region (-30 residues) of a single antibody variable domain 
could mutate into 10 out of the 20 amino acids, this would 
produce about 1030 variants for each chain. So the problem at 
this stage is not the generation of diversity, but the continuous 
selection of improvements against a background of 
degeneracy63• As immunization proceeds, additional high­
affinity antibodies gradually emerge with V-D-J combinations 
which are rarely found in the primary repertoire (repertoire 
shift)64. 
In 'classical' antibody engineering, hybridomas of known 
specificity have provided the raw material for cloning the 
rearranged antibody VH and VL genes. However, using 'uni­
versal' primers and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) it is 
possible to rescue V genes21•23•65•66 and by building restriction 
sites into these primers the amplified DNA can be cloned directly 
for expression in mammalian cells21 or bacteria23•24. 
This offers new routes for the derivation of monoclonal 
antibody-producing cell lines (Fig. 5). At its simplest, it allows 
V genes to be rescued from hybridomas21, unstable hybridoma 
fusions (for example mouse-human hybridomas), single 
hybridoma cells67•68 or even single B lymphocytes. Hybridomas 
have advantages because fusion enriches for antigen-stimulated 
cells. However, rescue from single B lymphocytes bypasses cell 
fusion, allowing access to terminally differentiated B cells which 
296 are rich in messenger RNA but are not able to fuse. Single 
hybridomas or B cells might also be isolated by binding to 
antigen, immobilized on solid supports (for example on plates 
or magnetic beads), by fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
(FACS) or by rosetting with antigen-coated red cells. The single 
set of V genes from individual cells could then be co-expressed 
in bacteria. But in this case each cell must be processed 
separately. 
Cloning from heterogeneous cell populations has the advan­
tage that all the cells can be processed together. For example,

Primer mixtures can be designed for PCR amplification of most families of 
V genes, as the nucleotide sequences at the 5' and 3' ends of the rearranged 
V genes are relatively conserved21. At the 5' end, mixed PCR primers have 
been based within the signal sequence65·67 or at the N-terminal end of the 
mature variable domain21·66. At the 3' end, PCR primers have been located 
within the J region or the C region. One set of PCR primers, located entirely 
within the rearranged V-gene exon, amplifies both mRNA and chromosomal 
DNA21·23. The PCR primers incorporate restriction sites and after 
amplification and digestion with restriction enzymes can be cloned into 
specialized plasmid or A phage vectors directly for expression of the v 
genes. The cloning of VH and VL genes into a plasmid expression vector is 
illustrated here. (L, leader sequence for secretion into bacterial periplasm 
and/or beyond outer membrane; R, polylinker cloning site; X and Y, extra 
polypeptide sequence (for example, heavy chain CH1 domain, light chain CL 
domain or peptide tag for recognition by monoclonal antibody).)

an immunized mouse have been combined at random and Fab 
fragments expressed from A phage screened for antigen-binding 
activities24• The disadvantage is that the original VH and VL 
pairing, selected for high affinity by immunization, is lost. A 
combinatorial library with only 1,000 different VH and 1,000 
different VL gene elements equally represented, would necessi­
tate the screening of between 106 and 5 x 106 clones to recover 
most of the original pairings. Thus the chances of recovering 
original pairs of V genes from a large random combinatorial 
library from an immunized mouse are low, and even more remote 
for the highest affinity antibodies of hyperimmune animals. 
Those pairs of VH and VL domains that are found to be capable 
of binding antigen69•70 are likely to do so at lower affinity or 
with lower specificity than those selected by antigen. Although 
isolation of an anti-hapten Fab fragment with a good affinity 
has been reported24 using such an approach, if the aim of this 
technology is to bypass hybridomas, it will need to make the 
high-affinity antibodies required for diagnosis and therapy, anti­
bodies which are difficult to derive even with hybridomas. 
To improve the chances of recovering original pairs, the 
complexity of the combinatorial libraries could be reduced by 
using small populations of antigen-selected B lymphocytes ( Fig. 
5). But all combinatorial approaches will rely heavily on power­
ful screening methods. Here the use of membrane filters for 
screening large numbers of clones is promising. A variety of 
formats have been deployed; for example, capture of antibodies 
on filters coated with antigen, and detection with anti-globulin 
reagents 1°. Alternatively, antibodies or Fab fragments have been 
immobilized directly on membrane filters24 or indirectly through 
antiglobulin reagents (A. Skerra, M. Dreher, E. Gheradi, G. W. 
and C.M., unpublished results) and probed with labelled 
antigen. 
Bypassing animals? 
Looking ahead, it may become possible to build antibodies from 
first principles, taking advantage of the structural framework 
on which the antigen-binding loops fold. In general these loops 
have a limited number of conformations which generate an 
endless variety of binding sites by alternative combinations and 
by diverse side chains 71•72•64. Recent successes in modelling 
antigen-binding sites41•72 augurs well for de novo design. This 
approach might become attractive for making catalytic anti­
bodies, particularly for small substrates. Here side chains or 
binding sites for prosthetic groups 73 might be introduced, not 
only to bind selectively to the transition state of the substrate, 
but also to participate directly in bond making and breaking. 
The only question is whether the antibody architecture, special­
ized for binding, is the best starting point for building catalysts. 
Genuine enzyme architectures, such as the TIM barrel, might 
be more suitable. Like antibodies, TIM enzymes also have a 
framework structure (a barrel of /3 strands and a helices) and 
loops to bind substrate. Many enzymes with a diversity of 
catalytic properties are based on this architecture 74 and the loops 
might be manipulated independently of the frameworks75 for 
design of new catalytic and binding properties. 
Instead of the 'design and build' approach, could we build 
an artificial selection system, for example harnessing bacteria 
or phage, to select for antigen-binding activities? Here no struc­
tural information about the antigen is needed. But we see no 
future in trying to select high-affinity binding activities in a 
single step. The strategy of the immune system, in which low 
affinity evolves to high affinity seems more realistic25• Can we 
imitate this strategy and indeed improve on it? 
Our first task is to prepare a naive repertoire of antibody 
genes (Fig. 6). At its simplest we could use the polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and universal primers to reproduce in vitro the 
repertoire of rearranged V genes expressed by naive animals. 
However 'naive' animals are not really naive and the available 
repertoire is limited in size and shaped, for example by tolerance 
NATURE · VOL 349 · 24 JANUARY 1991 REVIEW ARTICLE 
to self-epitopes. In principle we could adopt the mammalian 
strategy of assembling a much larger repertoire by random 
combination between restriction fragments encoding the germ­
line V, D and J elements. To match the potential repertoire of 
the animal, we would also have to reproduce the junctional 
diversity created by recombination. Large repertoires might also 
be made by trying to immitate the process of gene conversion 
adopted by birds76• 
But such 'natural' repertoires are not ideal. The sequences of 
germ-line V genes and the multiplicity of highly related V genes 
in the genome are presumably themselves the result of chance 
and evolutionary pressures, for example towards recognition of 
pathogens and against recognition of self-components. Such 
repertoires are both biased and highly redundant. More efficient 
repertoires might be constructed by using V genes from a variety 
of animal sources, excluding highly related V genes and even 
designing entirely new V genes or D segments. For example, 
the structures of individual antibody loops are often very similar

FIG. 5 Strategies for cloning paired VH and VL genes from lymphocytes of 
an immunized animal. VH and VL genes (expressed as pairs VHXIVLy) from 
n lymphocytes can be amplified by PCR from the mRNA or genomic DNA of 
single cells or populations. The lymphocytes can also be selected by antigen­
binding. or immortalized as hybridomas by fusion with myeloma cells or by 
infection with Epstein-Barr virus. From single lymphocytes, or clones. the 
original VHa/VLa gene combination is readily rescued. From populations of 
lymphocytes, repertoires of VH-VL genes (VLn) could be combined at random, 
and antigen-binding combinations selected. But for large populations of 
lymphocytes, original combinations of VH and VL genes will be a minor 
proportion of heterologous combinations, some of which may display residual 
antigen-binding activity. The library will contain (n -1)2 VHxVLy elements, 
(n -1) each of VHXVLa and VHaVLy elements and a single VHaVLa element. 
VHa and VLa (or close derivatives), however, may occur repeatedly. Thus, 
at earlier stages or immunization, there are likely to be some artificial pairs 
which originate from different but closely related clones which can bind 
antigen, particularly with responses dominated by 'unique' VH and VL gene 
combinations (restricted or idiotypic responses 59·60). Ref. 90 is in agreement 
with this prediction. As maturation for high affinity proceeds, the number 
of mutations increase and the likelihood of effective heterologous com­
plementation diminishes. 
297 © 1991Nature  Publishing GroupREVIEW ARTICLE 
in their overall fold71•72, and the loops could be fleshed with 
diverse side chains. 
The next stage is to express the library and screen for antigen­
binding activities by random combination of VH and VL 
domains. Ideally the library should be 'complete', containing 
antibodies of a minimum binding affinity for any conceivable 
epitope. The tighter the binding of a primary antibody, the larger 
the library required. For example, it has been estimated that a 
primary repertoire of 107 different antibodies is likely to recogn­
ize more than 99 per cent of epitopes with an affinity constant 
of 105 M-1 or better, and rarely contributes high-affinity anti­
bodies to an epitope taken at random (> 109 M-1) (ref. 77). If 
millions of VH and VL combinations from an artificial library 
could be screened, for example on membrane filters with a 
cut-off affinity of at least 105 M-1, then the library would be as 
complete as the primary repertoire of a single mouse (107 anti­
body species). In the future, the screening of large libraries 
may well be replaced by methods of selection. For ex­
ample, by expressing functional antibody fragments at the 
surface of phage, desired V-gene combinations can be enriched 
by binding to antigen 78. If these screening and selection tech­
niques worked as well as those in the animal, we could imi­
tate the primary response and generally obtain low-affinity 
antibodies. 
The enhancement of affinity in vivo can be contributed by a 
single point mutation, or several mutations64. Hypermutation 
of the genes corresponding to antibodies of low affinity should 
be easy to imitate in vitro. Point mutations could be introduced 
into the V genes by many techniques, for example, by using 
error-prone polymerases, PCR amplification through a large 
number of cycles, biased ratios of nucleotide triphosphates or 
'spiked' oligonucleotide primers. Multiple mutations could be 
targeted throughout the body of the gene simultaneously, or to 
each of the hypervariable loops 79. 
The screening or selection of the mutants with improved 
affinity is likely to be more difficult, as it needs to discriminate 
between mutants differing slightly in affinity. Such discrimina­
tion is possible for hybridoma clones in agarose10, by binding 
secreted antibody on coated membranes with different antigen 
density. The differential binding to antigen-coated membranes 
might also be achieved by competiton with low-affinity antibody. 
The system we are proposing, however, is primitive compared 
with the animal. Ideally we would like to hypermutate specific 
segments of DNA within cells rather than in isolated DNA, and 
at the same time express the products on the cell surface, and 
select in a darwinian fashion variants of steadily increasing 
affinity. Animals are superb at this job, and it will not be easy 
to compete with their efficiency. We may learn to imitate the 
animal strategy, but in the meantime for the production of 
high-affinity antibodies we will normally do better by stealing 
hypermutated V genes from immunized animals. 
Human antibodies: today and tomorrow 
Making human monoclonal antibodies has posed difficulties for 
hybridoma technology. For example, the use of the mouse 
myeloma as a fusion partner for human cells leads to preferential 
loss of human chromosomes, and intolerable instability of the 
hybrids. Hybridomas are derived from spleen or lymph nodes, 
whereas the primary source from humans, the peripheral blood 
lymphocytes, contains few blast cells actively involved in the 
immune response. As an alternative to fusion, immortalization 
of human cells by Epstein-Barr virus does not lead to preferen­
tial immortalization of blasts engaged in antibody responses, 
and also leads to lines which are low producers of antibody and 
unstable80. Further, humans can rarely be hyperimmunized to 
order, especially with noxious chemicals, pathogenic viruses or 
cancer cells. In any case, the isolation of human antibodies to 
human cell-surface antigens would have to overcome tolerance 
mechanisms which eliminate lymphocytes with self-reactivity. 
Human lymphocytes have recently been used to populate severe 
298 combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and these animals can 
be immunized81•82 to make human antibodies. 
Gene technology offers alternatives. The 'humanizing' of 
rodent monoclonal antibodies is currently the most practical 
approach. It allows access to a vast pool of rodent antibodies 
with good affinities and specificities. This is a major advantage, 
particularly when dealing with antibodies for tumour therapy, 
or for the manipulation in vivo of the human immune system.

FIG. 6 Mimicking the immune system. VH and VL gene repertoires derived 
by a range of methods, such as reproduction of the available library from 
lymphoid cells, assembly of V, D and J elements, or gene cross over (to 
mimic gene conversion). The genes are cloned and expressed, and VH-VL 
pairs binding to antigen can be selected or screened, for example on 
membrane filters. Here the VH-VL pair, binding to antigen (Ag), is tagged 
with a C-terminal peptide recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb), or is 
expressed on the surface of a bacterium or phage. For detection, the mAb 
or Ag can, for example, be coupled to radioisotope, or to an enzyme for 
production of a coloured dye. A, Capture of VH-VL with antigen and detection 
with mAb. Other schemes could involve capture by binding to membrane 
and detection with Ag or capture by mAb and detection with Ag. B, Capture 
with Ag and detection of phage plaques. The genes encoding VH-VL pairs, 
identified as antigen-binding, can be rescued and hypermutated to form the 
secondary antibody libarary. These genes can then be expressed and 
screened for improved binding to antigen. This process will need to be 
repeated several times to achieve the efficiency of animal immune systems. 
Selection systems for catalytic antibodies might differ from those above. 
Such antibodies have been made through hybridoma technology by immuniz­
ation with transition-state analogues, or by chance2·3. But animals select 
antibodies on the basis of binding, not catalysis, and the transfer of V-gene 
repertoires to bacteria gives a new twist to the field24. Vast libraries might 
be screened directly, not for binding, but for catalysis for example with 
substrates yielding fluorescent products, or by complementation of bacterial 
mutants deficient in a catalytic step of interest. In this case, antibodies will 
need to be expressed intracellularly89.

leukocytes4
• Reshaping these antibodies, by transplanting only 
the antigen-binding loops to human antibodies29•31, yields 
humanized antibodies which may have similar immunogenicity 
to truly human antibodies. In future, several other approaches 
may become available through gene technology as discussed in 
earlier sections. Furthermore, transgenic mice have been made 
which carry immunoglobulin heavy V, D, J and human C 
regions83 and this should allow human antibodies to be produced 
directly from hyperimmunized mice. It remains to be seen 
whether the size of the repertoires, limited by the amount of 
new DNA that can be carried by the transgenic animal, will be 
a drawback. 
But all these methods will have to compete with immortaliz­
ation by Epstein-Barr virus and cell fusion, which themselves 
are constantly improving, particularly as they start to incorporate

299 ",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to genetically engineer antibodies to improve their binding affinity and specificity for antigens.,"Research hypothesis: By using gene technology to construct a diverse library of antibody genes and applying screening and selection methods, it is possible to generate high-affinity antibodies with improved binding specificity for antigens.

Research proposal: The research aims to utilize gene technology to create a comprehensive library of antibody genes, mimicking the natural immune response process. This library will be screened and selected for antibodies with improved binding affinity and specificity for antigens. The study will involve the rescue of V genes from immunized animals, assembly of V, D, and J elements, and gene cross over to create a diverse repertoire. Screening and selection methods will be employed to identify antibodies with desired binding properties. The research will also explore the potential for hypermutation of specific DNA segments within cells to enhance antibody affinity. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust method for generating high-affinity antibodies with improved binding specificity, potentially leading to advancements in therapeutic and diagnostic antibody development."

Abstract
Significant tumor regressions have been observed in up to 70% of patients receiving adoptively 
transferred autologous melanoma-reactive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) 1,2, and in pilot 
trials, 40% of treated patients experienced complete regressions of all measurable lesions for at 
least five years following treatment 3. To evaluate the potential association between the ability of 
TIL to mediate durable regressions and their ability to recognize potent antigens that presumably 
include mutated gene products, a novel screening approach was developed that involved mining 
whole exome sequence data to identify the mutated proteins that were expressed in patient tumors. 
Candidate mutated T cell epitopes that were identified using an MHC binding algorithm 4 were 
then synthesized and evaluated for recognition by TIL. Using this approach, mutated antigens 
expressed on autologous tumor cells were identified as targets of three TIL that were associated 
with objective tumor regressions following adoptive transfer. This simplified approach, which 
avoids the need to generate and laboriously screen cDNA libraries from tumors, may represent a 
generally applicable method for identifying mutated T cell antigens expressed in melanoma as 
well as other tumor types.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe identification of antigens associated with tumor rejection mediated by TIL has been 
challenging, given the diversity of these bulk populations and the relatively laborious nature 
of current antigen screening approaches. We have developed a novel screening method to 
identify mutated candidate epitopes that initially involved whole exome sequencing of tumor 
and matched normal cell DNA to identify somatic mutations. High-affinity candidate T cell 
epitopes identified in silico  by scanning 19-mer polypeptides centered on mutated residues 
with a peptide-MHC binding algorithm 4 were then screened for recognition by TIL. We 
focused on identifying T cell epitopes presented in the context of HLA-A class I gene 
products, which were previously found to be expressed at higher levels in melanomas than 
HLA-B and C products 5, in three individuals with metastatic melanoma who demonstrated 
regression of bulky metastatic lesions following the adoptive transfer of autologous TIL.
Initially, DNA isolated from the melanoma cell line 2098 mel, which was generated from a 
metastatic lesion an individual who was homozygous for the highly prevalent HLA class I 
allele HLA-A*0201, was subjected to whole exome sequencing. The top 55 mutated 
candidate nonamers and decamer peptides identified from 2098 mel that were predicted to 
bind with high affinity to HLA-A*0201 were then synthesized and evaluated for their ability 
to sensitize the HLA-A*0201+ cell line T2 6 for recognition by autologous TIL. The results 
indicated that four peptides, 5th, 18th 19th and 38th of the predicted high affinity HLA-
A*02:01 binders, reproducibly stimulated high levels of IFN- γ release from the autologous 
TIL 2098 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Peptides #5 and #18 represented 
overlapping nonamer and decamers that corresponded to residues 26-34 and 26-35, 
respectively, of the casein kinase 1, alpha 1 (CSNK1A1) protein, a key regulator of the 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway 7. A di-nucleotide substitution of TA for CC at positions 
80 and 81 of the wild type CSNK1A1  coding region resulted in a serine to leucine change at 
position 27 in the wild type protein, .Peptide #19 was encoded by a point-mutated transcript 
of the growth arrest specific 7 ( GAS7 ) gene, previously identified as a mutated target of TIL 
2098 using a conventional cDNA library screening approach 8, and peptide #38 was 
corresponded to residues 154-162 of the HAUS augmin-like complex, subunit 3 (HAUS3) 
protein (Figure 1a), a molecule involved with microtubule formation within the mitotic 
spindle 9. Peptide titration assays demonstrated that A*0201+ target cells pulsed with a 
minimum of 1 nM of the mutated CSNK1A1 nonamer stimulated significant cytokine 
release from TIL 2098, while 100 nM of the mutated decamer stimulated a significant, albeit 
a significantly weaker response (Fig. 1b). The corresponding wild type CSNK1A1 peptides, 
which stimulated weaker responses than the mutated peptides, were not recognized at 
concentrations below 1 μM. The change at position two in the CSNK1A1 peptide from 
serine to leucine, which represents an optimal residue at one of the primary anchor positions 
in HLA-A*0201-binding peptides 10 enhanced the predicted HLA-A*0201 binding affinities 
of the CSNK1A1 peptides from > 1 μM to approximately 10 nM (Supplementary Table 1). 
TIL 2098 recognized targets pulsed with as little as 1 nM of the mutated GAS7 peptide and 
0.1 nM of the mutated HAUS3 peptides, and failed to recognize the corresponding wild type 
peptides (Fig. 1c,d). The change in the HAUS3 peptide was not predicted to alter the 
binding affinity of the mutated peptide and the change in the GAS7 peptide was predicted to 
lead to a modest reduction in the binding affinity from 12 to 39 nM, indicating that these 
may predominantly represent T cell contact residues.Robbins et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptWe then transfected antigen negative but HLA-A*0201+ target cells with genes encoding 
mutated epitopes in order to evaluate their ability to be naturally processed and presented. 
TIL 2098 recognized HLA-A*0201-transduced COS7 cells (COS-A2) that were transiently 
transfected with the mutated but not wild type CSNK1A1 and GAS7 constructs (Fig 1e,f), 
but failed to recognize 293 cells that were transiently transfected with HLA-A*0201 (293-
A2) plus the full length mutated HAUS3  construct (Fig. 1g). TIL 2098 did, however, 
recognize 293-A2 cells that were transfected with a mini-gene construct that encoded a 
methionine followed by the nine amino mutated HAUS3 epitope (Fig. 1g), indicating that 
this may represent an epitope that is preferentially processed either by the 
immunoproteasome 11,12 or recently described intermediate proteasomes that contain one or 
two of the three catalytic subunits of the immunoproteasome 13. Further analysis 
demonstrated that TIL 2098 recognized stable 293 transfectants expressing the β1i and β5i 
immunoproteasomal subunits that were transiently transfected with HLA-A*0201 plus either 
the mutated HAUS3  mini-gene or full length gene, but not the corresponding wild type 
HAUS3  constructs (Fig. 1g).
We then attempted to identify mutated antigens recognized by TIL 2369, which was derived 
from an individual with melanoma who expressed HLA-A*0101 and A*2601, by co-
incubating TIL with HLA-A*0101+ target cells that were pulsed individually with the top 53 
mutated candidate HLA-A*0101-binding peptides identified from 2369 mel (Supplementary 
Table 2). A mutated decamer encoded by the pleckstrin homology domain containing, 
family M member 2 ( PLEKHM2 ) gene that possessed the 2nd highest affinity of the 
predicted HLA-A*0101-binding peptides, as well as two overlapping mutated nonamer and 
decamers encoded by the protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3B ( PPP1R3B ) gene that 
represented the 17th and 23rd highest predicted binders, stimulated high levels of cytokine 
release from TIL 2369 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). TIL 2369 recognized target 
cells pulsed with a minimum of 1.0 μM of the mutated PLEKHM2 peptide (Fig. 2b) and 0.1 
μM of the overlapping PPP1R3B peptides (Fig. 2c), but failed to recognize cells pulsed with 
10 μM of the corresponding wild type peptides (Fig. 2b,c). TIL 2369 also recognized antigen 
negative HLA-A*0101+ cells transfected with cDNAs encoding the mutated but not the wild 
type PPP1R3B and PLEKHM2 gene products (Fig 2d). TIL 2369 failed to recognize any of 
the top 46 mutated candidate peptides that were predicted to bind to HLA-A*2601 with 
affinities ranging between 4 and 259 nM (Supplementary Table 3).
This approach was further examined by evaluating the ability of TIL isolated from a third 
individual with melanoma, TIL 3309, to recognize mutated candidate peptides identified 
from 3309 mel that were predicted to bind to either the autologous HLA-A*0101 or the 
A*1101 class I alleles. While none of the top 29 candidate HLA-A*0101-binding mutated 
peptides stimulated significant cytokine release from TIL 3309 (Supplementary Table 4), 
four of the top 46 candidate HLA-A*1101-binding mutated peptides, which included 
overlapping nonamer and decamer products of the matrilin 2 ( MATN2 ) and cyclin-dependent 
kinase 12 ( CDK12 ) genes, were recognized by TIL 3309 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 
5). The MATN2 protein is a member of the von Willebrand factor A domain containing 
family and may play a role in extracellular matrix formation 14, and CDK12 has been shown 
to regulate the expression of DNA damage response genes 15. The mutated MATN2 Robbins et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptnonamer and decamer possessed the second and fourth highest predicted binding affinities, 
respectively, of the candidate HLA-A*1101-binding peptides, while the mutated CDK12 
nonamer and decamer possessed the 24th and 36th highest predicted HLA-A*1101 binding 
affinities (Supplementary Table 5). The mutated MATN2 nonamer and decamer stimulated 
responses at minimum concentrations of 1 nM, whereas the corresponding wild type 
MATN2 peptides failed to stimulate significant cytokine release from this TIL at the highest 
concentration tested, 1 μM (Fig. 3b). TIL 3309 recognized targets pulsed with a minimum of 
1 nM and 100 nM of the mutated CDK12 nonamer and decamers, respectively, but failed to 
recognized targets pulsed with 1 μM of the corresponding wild type peptides (Fig. 3c). In 
addition, HLA-A*1101+ target cells transfected with the mutated but not the corresponding 
wild type MATN2 and CDK12 genes stimulated significant cytokine release from TIL 3309 
(Fig. 3d).
We then evaluated the expression of genes encoding mutated candidate epitopes by 
attempting to amplify partial cDNA transcripts from tumor cell mRNA using primers that 
flanked the putative mutation sites. In addition, amplified transcripts were subjected to 
Sanger sequencing in an attempt to validate whole exome sequencing results. Partial cDNA 
transcripts encoding 19 of the 62 candidate mutated A*0201-binding peptides identified 
from 2098 mel could be amplified from tumor cell RNA, while three of the amplified 
products appeared to exclusively encode the wild type and not the expected amino acid 
variant (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Methods Primer List). Transcripts 
encoding 27 of the top 56 candidate mutated high affinity HLA-A*0101 peptides identified 
from 2369 mel could be amplified from this cell line, while one of the amplified products 
encoded the wild type, rather than the expected mutated residue (Supplementary Table 2 and 
Supplementary Methods Primer List). In addition, transcripts encoding 28 of the 46 
candidate mutated HLA-A*1101-binding peptides evaluated for recognition by TIL 3309 
could be amplified from 3309 mel, whereas one of the amplified products appeared to 
exclusively encode the wild type and not the expected mutated amino acid (Supplementary 
Table 5 and Supplementary Methods Primer List). Combining the peptide prediction results 
with gene expression analysis demonstrated that TIL 2098 and 2369 recognized the mutated 
peptides with the highest predicted binding affinity for HLA-A*0201 and *0101, 
respectively, and TIL 3309 recognized the peptide with the second highest predicted binding 
affinity for HLA-A*1101 among the proteins expressed by autologous tumor cells 
(Supplementary Table 6). Taken together, these results indicated that TIL may generally 
recognize mutated epitopes that bind with high affinity to MHC class I molecules.
We then evaluated the contribution of T cells recognizing mutated targets to in vitro  as well 
as in vivo  anti-tumor responses by carrying out ELISPOT assays on infused TIL as well as 
samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained prior to and following 
therapy. The responses of TIL 2098 to HLA-A*0201+ target cells that were pulsed with 
either the mutated GAS7 and CSNK1A1 nonamer peptides were comparable to those 
directed against the autologous tumor, while lower but significant responses were directed 
against the mutated HAUS3 peptide (Fig. 4a). Although T cells may in some cases be 
stimulated more efficiently by the high levels of peptide that result from pulsing target cells 
than those resulting from endogenous processing, the ELISPOT response of TIL 2098 to the Robbins et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2098 mel cell line that was nearly 60% of that generated in response to a polyclonal 
activator, indicating that 2098 mel represented a potent activator of the autologous TIL. Pre-
treatment samples were not available for the first subject, but the responses against the 
mutated GAS7 and CSNK1A1 peptides observed in PBMC obtained approximately one 
month after transfer may have reflected low levels of persistence of adoptively transferred T 
cells recognizing these antigens (Fig. 4a). These results, taken together with the lack of 
response against HLA-matched melanomas (Fig. 4a and 8), indicated that TIL 2098 
predominantly recognized mutated and not shared T cell epitopes.
Similarly, TIL 2369 responded strongly to HLA-A0101+ cells that were pulsed with the 
mutated PPP1R3B nonamer, which stimulated approximately 50% of the number of 
ELISPOTs than those observed against the autologous 2369 mel, and a lower but significant 
response against the mutated PLEKHM2 peptide (Fig. 4b). TIL 2369 failed to recognize 
allogeneic melanoma cell lines that shared expression of HLA-A*01 (Fig. 2d) or HLA-A*01 
and A*26 with 2369 mel (Fig. 4b), which, taken together with the robust response against 
the mutated PPP1R3B and PLEKHM2 peptides, indicated that TIL 2369 may predominantly 
recognized mutated gene products. This individual had failed to respond clinically to 
treatment with a similar TIL product that was administered in the absence of a prior 
conditioning two months before receiving the TIL analyzed in this report. The low levels of 
T cells recognizing the mutated PLEKHM2 and PPP1R3B peptides and tumor cells in the 
earlier peripheral blood sample obtained approximately one month following the initial TIL 
transfer (designated Pre-PBMC) therefore presumably reflected the in vivo  persistence of T 
cells following the initial TIL transfer. Higher levels of T cells reactive with the mutated 
PLEKHM2 and PPP1R3B peptides as well as 2369 mel were observed in PBMC obtained 
following the second TIL treatment (designated Post-PBMC), although we cannot rule out 
the possibility that T cells from the first treatment were present at this time.
An evaluation of ELISPOT responses in the third subject revealed that the response of 
autologous TIL 3309 to HLA-A*1101+ target cells that had been pulsed with the mutated 
CDK12 epitope was approximately 60% of that observed against the autologous 3309 mel, 
while the response to the MATN2 peptide was approximately 10% of that observed against 
the autologous mel. TIL 3309 also strongly recognized an allogeneic melanoma, 624 mel, 
that shared expression of HLA-C*07 with autologous cells (Fig. 4c), indicating that these T 
cells also recognized a shared epitope that was likely to represent a non-mutated gene 
product. Significant reactivity against the CDK12 and MATN2 peptides, as well as 
autologous 3309 mel, was observed in peripheral blood one month following autologous 
TIL transfer (Fig. 4c), at a time when CD8+ T cells comprised approximately 90% of the 
CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood. Reactivity against the CDK12 and MATN2 peptides, 
however, was undetectable in peripheral blood obtained prior to adoptive TIL transfer (Fig. 
4c), and thus any increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells reactive with these epitopes 
also reflected an increase in their absolute number.
Antigens recognized by tumor-reactive T cells have previously been identified by a variety 
of approaches that include the screening of antigen negative target cells that were transfected 
with individual cDNAs 16,17 or cDNA pools 18,19 generated from tumor cell lines, mass 
spectrometric analysis of peptides eluted from the surface of tumor cells 20, as well as Robbins et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptproteomic analysis of tumor cell lysates 21. More than 400 T cell epitopes including over 50 
mutated epitopes that were identified primarily from clonal or bulk populations of 
melanoma reactive T cells have been identified using these approaches 22. The approach 
described in this report complements cumbersome cDNA library cloning methodologies, 
which can be influenced by factors such as the size and expression levels of transcripts that 
encode T cell epitopes.
A mutated cancer antigen was recently identified from a methylcholanthrene-induced 
sarcoma that arose in a Rag2−/− mouse 23 and mutated T cell epitopes identified in B16F10 
murine melanoma cells 24 from whole exome sequencing. The results of in vivo  tumor 
model studies indicated that these mutated epitopes provided partial protection from tumor 
growth, supporting the potential utility of this method for identifying clinically relevant 
tumor antigens.
We have begun to evaluate the potential correlation between reactivity to mutated antigens 
and clinical response to adoptive TIL transfer. In the current study, three therapeutic TIL 
contained dominant populations of T cells reactive with mutated epitopes. Reactivity to 
mutated antigens appears to be of high importance, since only a small proportion of T cells 
in TIL appear to recognize melanocyte differentiation antigens and cancer germline 
antigens 25. Preliminary results indicate that TIL from one of two patients who failed to 
response to autologous TIL transfer recognized a single mutated epitope identified by 
exomic sequencing. Thus, this approach has lead to the identification of a total of eight 
mutated epitopes recognized by four of the five melanoma TIL that have been evaluated to 
date, demonstrating that this represents a reliable method for identifying tumor-specific T 
cell epitopes. This simple and rapid genomic approach should also facilitate the 
identification of candidate epitopes from additional tumor types and provide an opportunity 
to generate tumor reactive T cells by in vitro  sensitization against the identified epitopes.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptWhole exome sequencing
Genomic DNA purification, library construction, exome capture of approximately 20,000 
coding genes, and next generation sequencing of tumor and normal samples were performed 
at Personal Genome Diagnostics (Baltimore, MD), while bioinformatic analyses were 
carried out by Personal Genome Diagnostics and the Genome Technology Access Center, 
Genomics and Pathology Services of the Washington University School of Medicine. In 
brief, genomic DNA from tumor and normal samples were fragmented and used for Illumina 
TruSeq library construction (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Exonic regions were captured in 
solution using the Agilent SureSelect 50 Mb kit (version 3) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Paired-end sequencing, resulting in 100 bases from 
each end of the fragments, was performed using a HiSeq 2000 Genome Analyzer (Illumina, 
San Diego, CA). Sequence data were mapped to the reference human genome sequence and 
sequence alterations were determined by comparison of over 50 million bases of tumor and 
normal DNA. Over 8 billion bases of sequence data were obtained for each sample, with a 
high fraction from the captured coding regions. Over 43 million bases of target DNA were 
analyzed in the tumor and normal samples, and an average of 42 to 51 reads were obtained 
at each base in the normal and tumor DNA samples. The tags were aligned to the human 
genome reference sequence (hg18) using the Eland algorithm of CASAVA 1.6 software 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). The chastity filter of the BaseCall software of Illumina was used 
to select sequence reads for subsequent analysis. The ELANDv2 algorithm of CASAVA 1.6 
software (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was then a applied to identify point mutations and small 
insertions and deletions. Known polymorphisms recorded in dbSNP were removed from the 
analysis. Potential somatic mutations were filtered and visually inspected as described 
previously 26. The DNA isolated from the 2098 mel, 2369 mel and 3309 mel cell lines 
possessed 264, 574 and 278 non-synonymous single and di-nucleotide substitutions, 
respectively. Between 80 and 90% of the non-synonymous point mutations identified in the 
2098, 2369 and 3309 tumor cell linesrepresented C/G to T/A transitions, consistent with the 
role of UV in generating the majority of mutations found in non-acral melanomas 2728.
Analysis of gene expression
Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify fragments of gene products ranging 
between approximately 100 and 600 nucleotides encompassing the mutated epitopes in 
2098, 2369 and 3309 mel (Supplementary Methods Primer List). These primers sets were 
used to carry out RT-PCRs, as previously described 19, from approximately 1 μg of RNA 
that was isolated from the appropriate tumor cell lines using RNAeasy (Qiagen Inc., 
Valencia, CA 91355). Amplified cDNA transcripts were either directly sequenced using 
after purification of the RT-PCR products using the PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Life 
Technologies, Grand Island, NY 14072) or cloned into pCDNA3.1 TOPO TA (Life 
Technologies) and sequenced using the T7 oligonucleotide primer 5 ′- 
TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3 ′.
Peptides
The residues surrounding amino acids resulting from non-synonymous mutations were 
scanned to identify candidate nonamer and decamer peptides that were predicted to bind Robbins et al. Page 7

algorithm 4. Peptides were obtained from PiProteomics (Huntsville, AL, 35816) or Peptide 
2.0 (Chantilly, VA 20151). Mutated peptides identified by this approach were then purified 
to greater than 95% homogeneity by HPLC and re-evaluated to confirm their ability to 
stimulate T cell responses.
Analysis of T cell responses
The TIL 2098, 2369 and 3309 were expanded from fresh tumor digests as previously 
described 29,30. Reactivity of TIL 2098 was evaluated by incubating HLA-A*02:01+ T2 
cells that possess antigen processing defects that allow efficient loading of exogenous 
peptides 31 with candidate HLA-A*02:01 binding peptides at a concentration of 10 μM for 
two hours at 370C followed by two washing steps. Endogenous processing of the epitopes 
recognized by TIL 2098 was evaluated in 293 cells that were co-transfected with 200 ng of a 
recombinant pCDNA3.1 plasmid (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) encoding candidate 
epitopes and 50 ng of a recombinant pCDNA3.1 plasmid encoding HLA-A*02:01, and the 
levels of soluble IFN- γ released from TIL that were cultured overnight with either peptide 
pulsed target cells, transfectants or tumor cells were measured, as previously described 19. 
Evaluation of responses of TIL 2098 against the GAS7 and C4orf15 mutated and wild type 
constructs were carried out in 293 cells expressing the β1i and β5i immunoproteasomal 
subunits. The HLA-A*01:01+ tumor cell line 537 mel, which is not recognized by TIL 2369, 
and the HLA-A*02:01+ tumor cell line 624 mel, that is not recognized by TIL 2098, served 
as negative controls for T cell reactivity. Evaluation of peptide reactivity of TIL 2369 was 
carried out by pulsing 293 human embryonic kidney cells that were transduced with a 
recombinant retroviral expression plasmid encoding HLA-A*01 (293-A1) with candidate 
HLA-A*01:01 binding peptides at a concentration of 10 μM for two hours at 370C, followed 
by two washing steps. To determine if the epitopes identified as targets of TIL 2369 were 
endogenously processed and presented, 293-A1 target cells were transiently transfected with 
either the genes encoding the mutated candidates or the corresponding wild type genes. 
Evaluation of the reactivity of TIL 3309 was carried out by pulsing COS cells that had been 
stably transduced with retroviral constructs encoding either HLA-A*0101 or HLA-A*1101 
with candidate HLA-A*01 or A*11-binding peptides at a concentration of 10 μM for two 
hours at 370C, followed by two washing steps. To determine if the epitopes identified as 
targets of TIL 3309 were endogenously processed and presented, COS-A11 target cells were 
transiently transfected with either the genes encoding the mutated candidates or the 
corresponding wild type genes, and the levels of soluble IFN- γ released from TIL that were 
cultured overnight with target cells were measured as previously described 19. Quantitation 
of responses directed against tumor cell lines and peptide pulsed target cells was evaluated 
in an IFN- γ ELISPOT assay using a monoclonal antibody pair obtained from Mabtech. 
ELISPOT. Assays were carried out by initially thawing T cells overnight in the absence of 
exogenous cytokines, followed by culturing with tumor cells or COS-7 cells expressing

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to identify mutated T cell antigens expressed in melanoma and other tumor types.,"Research Hypothesis:
The identification of mutated T cell antigens expressed in melanoma and other tumor types can be achieved through whole exome sequencing and subsequent screening of candidate mutated peptides for recognition by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).

Research Proposal:
We propose to utilize whole exome sequencing to identify mutated proteins expressed in patient tumors and then screen the candidate mutated T cell epitopes for recognition by TIL. This approach will enable the identification of mutated antigens associated with tumor rejection mediated by TIL, providing insights into the potential correlation between reactivity to mutated antigens and clinical response to adoptive TIL transfer. Furthermore, this method may facilitate the generation of tumor-reactive T cells by in vitro sensitization against the identified epitopes, thereby contributing to the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for melanoma and other tumor types."

INTRODUCTION
Gram-negative bacteria characteristically are surrounded by
an outer membrane (OM). Analysis of prokaryote phylogenyusing signature sequences in proteins even led to the notionthat a major phylogenetic division exists between organismswith double-membrane envelopes (diderms) and those withonly a simple cytoplasmic membrane (monoderms) (240). It islikely that the most important function for the additional mem-brane layer, the OM, in gram-negative bacteria is to serve as aselective permeation barrier. My earlier review of this subject,written with Martti Vaara, appeared in 1985 (464). It was anopportune time for such a review because the fundamentalproperties of the Escherichia coli porins and the speciﬁc mal-
todextrin channel, LamB, were characterized a few years ear-lier (see, for example, references 388 and 460–462) and theasymmetric structure of the OM bilayer, with lipopolysaccha-rides (LPS) located exclusively in the outer leaﬂet (316), of-fered an explanation for the unusually slow inﬂux of lipophilicsolutes. In the intervening 18 years, explosive progress hasoccurred in the ﬁeld. Diffusion through the nonspeciﬁc porinchannels and the speciﬁc channels are now understood in mo-lecular detail, thanks to the elucidation of the crystal structureof these proteins. Channel proteins were identiﬁed in manynonenteric bacteria as a result of the rapid growth of ourknowledge of the genome sequences, and in some cases thishas offered insights into the physiology of various organisms intheir native habitat. Studies of LPS not only showed us theimpressive diversity of LPS structures in the bacterial kingdombut also led to the realization that the LPS structure may bemodiﬁed in response to the conditions prevailing in the envi-ronment.
The present review attempts to summarize the development
in the ﬁeld since 1985. The major problem in presenting theresults has been the information explosion. For example, morethan 650 articles with the word “porin” in the title have beenpublished during this period. If the databases are searched with
“porin” or “lipopolysaccharide” as keywords, literally thou-sands of references are retrieved. Therefore, I had to be se-verely restrictive with citations in order to keep the reviewwithin a reasonable (and perhaps useful) size. I tried to limitthe discussion strictly to selective permeability, eliminatingmost papers dealing with the biosynthesis and assembly of theOM or with the role of the OM in the interaction of bacteriawith the environment, including higher animals and plants. Ialso apologize at the outset for the omission of many refer-ences which were not cited because the main message could befound in other articles or reviews or, probably most frequently,because of my oversight.
PROTEIN CHANNELS
OMs, like other biological membranes, are fundamentally
built as a bilayer of lipids. As such, lipid bilayers show littlepermeability for hydrophilic solutes, including most nutrients.Therefore, they contain channel-forming proteins for the pur-pose of allowing the inﬂux of nutrients and perhaps for theextrusion of waste products. One such nonspeciﬁc channel-forming protein, porin, was discovered in 1976 (438), and theword “porin” was proposed speciﬁcally for this class of proteinsforming nonspeciﬁc diffusion channels. As predicted, porinswere found in every species of gram-negative bacteria investi-gated and even in a group of “gram-positive” bacteria, theCorynebacterium-Nocardia-Mycobacterium complex, which pro-
duces a lipid-rich, bilayer-like “cell wall” (see below). (Interest-ingly, the Corynebacterium-Nocardia-Mycobacterium complex
appears to be related to gram-negative bacteria on the basis ofsignature sequence analysis, since both of these groups have a12-residue deletion in the S12 ribosomal protein, unlike ar-chaebacteria and other gram-positive bacteria [240]).
At about the same time as bacterial porin was discovered,594 NIKAIDO MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.porins in mitochondria were discovered (584); this was fol-
lowed a few years later by a study in my own laboratory usingdifferent approaches (773). The mitochondrial porins (voltage-dependent anion channels [VDAC]) are not discussed further,except to note that the channels are apparently large (up to 3nm in diameter), as expected, because mitochondria have noneed to exclude toxic molecules in the environment, and thatthe overall structure is thought to be similar to the /H9252-barrel
structure (to be discussed below) of bacterial porins. Manyreviews of mitochondrial porins exist (see, for example, refer-ences 65 and 397). Another eukaryotic organelle in whichporins were found is peroxisome (540 –542).
The word “porin ”has suffered from its popularity. As stated
above, it was de ﬁned to mean only proteins that form nonspe-
ciﬁc channels. Workers often concocted fanciful names like
“maltoporin ”for the LamB channel, which is speci ﬁc, or
“phosphoporin ”for the Escherichia coli PhoE porin, which
prefers anions in general and has no speci ﬁcity for phosphate.
These abuses of the term cause confusion and misunderstand-ing, and I present a plea, once again, to limit the word “porin ”
to references to nonspeci ﬁc channels only.
Classical Porins
Families of classical porins. The OM must allow transmem-
brane passage of nutrient molecules, which are usually smalland hydrophilic. At the time of the ﬁrst version of this review
(464), E. coli was known to produce three trimeric porins
(OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE). Since the studies of these porinsformed the basis of our current knowledge of many otherporins, they (and their homologs) are called “classical porins ”
in the present review. They show general preferences forcharge and size of the solute, with OmpF and OmpC prefer-ring cations slightly over anions and PhoE preferring anionsand with OmpF allowing the permeation of slightly largersolutes than OmpC does. Furthermore, the diffusion rates ofsugars of various sizes led to the estimate that the OmpF porinchannel had a diameter of about 12 A ˚. Since that time, a great
deal of progress has occurred in the ﬁeld, some of which is
described in minireviews (343, 453, 587, 598, 599).
X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that porins exist as
transmembrane /H9252-barrels (see below). However, crystal struc-
tures are available for only a few porins, and therefore itbecomes highly desirable to derive as much information fromprimary sequence. Unfortunately, comparison of primary se-quences of porins is extremely dif ﬁcult. This is because the
external loops between the transmembrane /H9252-strands undergo
very rapid mutational alterations as they interact with elementsof the external world, such as antibodies, components of theinnate immune system, bacteriocins, and phages. Because ofthis, simple alignment programs such as BLAST are “fooled ”
and create gaps at improper places. It is therefore important toﬁrst identify the transmembrane /H9252-strands and compare dif-
ferent sequences solely on the basis of the sequences of thesestrands. However, none of the simple algorithms proposed forthe detection of transmembrane strands work in a satisfactorymanner, as mentioned by Ferenci (199). The proposal made byFerenci was to look at the alignment of related porin se-quences and assume that the less variant regions correspond totransmembrane strands. This works very nicely when manysequences from isolates of the same species, for example, exist
(362, 482). However, in other cases one has to start from analignment of sequences of distantly related porins, and thisrequires the prior identi ﬁcation of transmembrane strands.
One method that seems to work reasonably well for the
detection of transmembrane strands is that of Jeanteur et al.(303, 304), which uses the sum of the hydrophobicity andhydrophobic moment of each 9- to 10-residue segments. Theiralignment, together with the addition of some newer sequencesaligned by myself, is shown in Fig. 1. In this way, we can seethat porins from /H9251-,/H9252-, and /H9253-protcobacteria are indeed re-
lated to each other, a conclusion that BLAST, for example,completely fails to show. Figure 1 also shows some character-istic features of porins from various groups of bacteria. (i)Porins from /H9253-proteobacteria show strong similarity to each
other and are characterized by the presence of short (10-residue) extensions at their N termini ( Vibrio cholerae OmpU
is an exception). If the alignment presented is correct, porinsfrom the Vibrio-Photobacterium group are unusual in contain-
ing exceptionally long L3 loops. Enterobacterial porins containthe characteristic PEFGGD signature sequence in L3, as notedpreviously (303). (ii) Porins from /H9252-proteobacteria have se-
quences that are similar to each other but quite divergent fromthose of the /H9253-proteobacteria. Although Fig. 1 shows only the
sequences of Neisseria meningitidis PorB and Bordetella pertus-
sisporin, several other sequences were aligned earlier (303,
304). (iii) Porins from /H9251-proteobacteria again seem to form a
group of their own.
Porins from the organisms in the ε-proteobacteria, which
forms a very deep branch almost reaching the bottom of thewhole Proteobacteria group, are indeed quite different in se-
quence, and I have not been able to align porins from Helico-
bacter pylori (60, 178, 196) or Campylobacter jejuni (78, 79, 362,
782) with the porin sequences shown in Fig. 1.
Functional assays. Nonspeci ﬁc diffusion of hydrophilic sol-
utes across the OM usually occurs through porin channels, andthus the activity of these channels in intact cells is most con-veniently assayed by determining the ﬂux of hydrophilic solutes
or ions. For isolated porin proteins, reconstitution into planarbilayer lipids allows the measurement of ﬂux of ions through
single channels. Although the single-channel conductance val-ues have been used to calculate the sizes of the channel byassuming that ions within the channel behave identically tothose in bulk solutions, this procedure often leads to mislead-ing results (452, 453). A remarkable example is found in somemutants of E. coli OmpF porin, where both crystallography and
the proteoliposome swelling assay (see below) showed enlarge-ment of the channel whereas single-channel conductanceshowed a signi ﬁcant decrease (571). Another problem in the
use of single-channel conductance is that it is often a result ofinsertion of a porin trimer, containing three open channels,rather than that of a “single ”channel. Thus, the data that E.
coliOmpF gave a single-channel conductance of about 2 nS in
1 M KCl led to the calculated pore diameter of 9 A ˚(52); this
was thought to validate the calculation because of the agree-ment of calculated diameter with that found later by crystal-lography. However, the conductance of 2 nS was actually theresult of insertion of three channels in a trimer, and the truesingle-channel conductance of OmpF is around 0.7 nS, whichgives an unreasonable prediction for the pore diameter (452).VOL. 67, 2003 MOLECULAR BASIS OF OUTER MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY 595596 NIKAIDO MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.FIG. 1. Sequence alignment of porins from /H9251-,/H9252-, and /H9253-proteobacteria. The classi ﬁcation of the source organisms into /H9253-,/H9252-, and /H9251-subdivisions is shown at the beginning. Transmembrane
/H9252-strands are indicated by highlighting, in red, the presence of hydrophobic amino acid residues at alternate positions. The PEFGGD motif of loop 3 in t heEnterobacteriaceae and corresponding
sequences are colored in blue. The alignment of E. coli OmpF (ECOOMPF), E. coli OmpC (ECOOMPC), E. coli PhoE (ECOPHOE), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae Rd P2 porin (HINP2), Neisseria
meningitidis PorB (NMEPORB), Bordetella pertussis porin (BPEPOR), Comamonas acidovorans Omp32 (CACPOR), Rhodopseudomonas blastica porin (RBLPOR), and Rhodobacter capsulatus
porin (RCAPOR) is basically that of Jeanteur et al. (303, 304), with minor adjustments. The rest of the sequences ( Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans porin [AFEPOR], Pasteurella multocida OmpH
[PMUOMPH], Serratia marcescens OmpF [SMAOMPF], Vibrio cholerae OmpU [VCHOMPU], Photobacterium profundus OmpL [PPROMPL], V. cholerae OmpT [VCHOMPT], and Brucella
abortus porin [BABPOR]) were aligned by me. The alignment relied mostly on the plot of (average hydrophobicity /H11001average hydrophobic moment) as speci ﬁed by Jeanteur et al. (303, 304)
and took into account the prediction of turns (485). The Gibbs motif sampling program (442) was also utilized (http://bayesweb.wadsworth.org/gibb s/gibbs.html), although this program predicted
only the /H9252-strands facing the lipid bilayer. When multiple sequences were available, deletions and insertions were assumed to have occurred in loops (199); th is approach was useful in the analysis
ofP. multocida OmpH (129, 390) and B. abortus porin (424, 482). The alignment of V. cholerae OmpU, V. cholerae OmpT, and P. profundum OmpL was dif ﬁcult but was helped by the comparison
among these three, as well as with Vibrio ﬁscheri OmpU and VCH1008 from the V. cholerae genome-sequencing project (both sequences retrieved from GenBank). No attempt was made to
align the variable-loop sequences carefully.VOL. 67, 2003 MOLECULAR BASIS OF OUTER MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY 597Single-channel conductance is a reasonable indicator of pore
size for large channels, but it must be used with the utmostcaution for small channels. This problem has also been dis-cussed in a recent review (693). Nevertheless, the planar bi-layer study is the only functional assay performed with manyporins; therefore, the single-channel conductance value forOmpF, 0.7 nS, is used as the reference in the discussion ofmany such porins (see “Other porins ”below).
The bilayer domain of the OM is asymmetric, at least in
Enterobacteriaceae , with the outer and inner lea ﬂets containing
nearly exclusively LPS and phospholipid molecules, respec-tively (see “Lipid bilayer as a diffusion barrier ”below). There-
fore, there is concern about the use of the phospholipid bi-layer, or even nonphysiological barriers such as oxidizedcholesterol, for planar ﬁlm studies. In fact, some authors have
argued that porin channels behave quite differently when theyare in a natural, asymmetric bilayer of the OM (168, 169). Inthis connection, it is important that an asymmetric planar bi-layer, containing on one side a deep-rough LPS exclusively,was used for experiments involving a trimeric porin of Para-
coccus denitri ﬁcans (732). There was no difference in single-
channel conductance regardless of whether the bilayer wasasymmetric or symmetric (i.e., containing phospholipids inboth lea ﬂets). However, the spontaneous insertion of porin
from the phospholipid side was accelerated more than an orderof magnitude if LPS was present on the other side, a result thatmay have important implications for the mechanism of assem-bly of OM proteins in intact cells. The voltage-gating behaviorwas affected somewhat, in a way that was expected if the totalpotential sensed by the porin molecules was the sum of exter-nal voltage and the internal potential arising from the presenceof excess negative charges on the LPS-containing outer lea ﬂet.
Another approach is the reconstitution of porins into mul-
tilayered proteoliposomes and the measurement of solute dif-fusion rates that are re ﬂected in the rates of osmotic swelling
of these vesicles in media containing the test solutes (460).Comparison of diffusion rates of solutes of various sizes gaveremarkably reliable values of the channel size with respect tothe crystallographic structure (see below). However, becauseswelling occurs in response to the movement of any solute,including components of the buffer, extreme care is needed
when this method is used to study the diffusion of chargedsolutes (461).
Finally, diffusion rates through porin channels can be mea-
sured in intact cells by coupling the in ﬂux of hydrophilic solutes
with a “sink”process. A convenient assay is to examine the
inﬂux of cephalosporins by coupling it to their hydrolysis by
periplasmic /H9252-lactamase (462); cephalosporins are especially
useful because a diverse collection of cephalosporins has beensynthesized and because the hydrolysis can be monitored easilyby recording changes in the optical density at 260 nm.
Crystallographic structure of porins. Undoubtedly the most
important progress in the study of porins was the elucidation ofthe three-dimensional structures of trimeric porins by electrondiffraction (297 –300, 705) and X-ray crystallography. The latter
approach had its ﬁrst success with a Rhodobacter capsulatus
trimeric porin (714 –718), an achievement that was quickly fol-
lowed by the elucidation of the structure of the E. coli OmpF
and PhoE porins (152). Important conclusions from thesestudies include the following (there are recent minireviews onthe structure of porins [343, 598, 599]).
(i) As predicted from earlier studies, porin monomers were
shown to cross the lipid bilayer as a /H9252-barrel or a series of 16
/H9252-strands. The strands are tilted rather strongly (by 30 to 60 °)
in relation to the barrel axis, as shown earlier by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (436), and this tilting in-creases the diameter of the barrel. (For the concept of sheernumber, which is related to the degree of tilt, see reference599.) The length of each transmembrane strand spans therange from only 7 (in strand 5) to 16 (in strand 1) residues inOmpF. Contact among the monomers is stabilized by hydro-phobic and polar interactions, and loop 2 tends to bend overthe wall of the barrel of the neighboring subunit, playing asigni ﬁcant role in stabilization (Fig. 2A).
(ii) The external surface of the barrel is occupied by li-
pophilic side chains. One striking observation about the R.
capsulatus porin was the presence of many aromatic amino
acid residues at both the outer and inner interfaces betweenthe bilayer and the aqueous medium (714). The presence ofthese “aromatic girdles ”has since been observed in the struc-
FIG. 2. Structure of the OmpF porin of E. coli. (A) View of the trimer from the top, that is, in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the
membrane. Loop 2, colored blue, plays a role in interaction of the monomer with its neighboring unit. Loop 3, colored orange, narrows the channel.(B) View of the monomeric unit from the side, roughly in the direction of the arrow in panel A. Loops 2 and 3 are colored as in panel A. (C) Viewof the monomeric unit from the top, showing the “eyelet ”or the constricted region of the channel. The eyelet is formed by Glu117 and Asp113
from the L3 loop, as well as four basic residues from the opposing barrel wall, Lys16, Arg42, Arg82, and Arg132, all shown as spheres. The diagramsare based on PDB ﬁle 2OMF. This ﬁgure and Fig. 4 and 6 were drawn by using the program PyMol (Warren L. DeLano, DeLano Scienti ﬁc LLC,
San Carlos, Calif. [http://www.pymol.org]).598 NIKAIDO M
ICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.ture of E. coli OmpF and PhoE (152) and many other OM
proteins. They are now known to exist, to a somewhat lesserextent, also in the structure of integral inner membrane pro-teins (see also reference 755).
(iii) It was observed, just before the elucidation of the struc-
tures of OmpF and PhoE, that porin sequences almost invari-ably end with a C-terminal phenylalanine (635). This featurewas con ﬁrmed with practically all OM channel proteins, al-
though in rare cases the C-terminal residue is tryptophan. ThisC-terminal residue is located at the OM/periplasm interface inOmpF and PhoE (152), and its conservation is at least partiallyexplained by this location.
(iv) Transmembrane strands are connected by short “turns ”
on the periplasmic side, but the “loops ”that connect the
strands on the external sides are often long. With both R.
capsulatus porin and OmpF, loop 2 folds back outward and
contributes to the connection with the neighboring monomer.Loop 3, connecting strand 5 with strand 6, is especially long (33residues in OmpF) and folds into the barrel to produce thenarrowing of the channel (often called the “eyelet ”) (Fig. 2B
and C). It was impossible to predict from simple folding pre-diction algorithms that the eyelet region, which has the stron-gest effects on the function of porin, is made in this manner,which falls outside of the regular succession of /H9252-strands. The
size of the eyelet region of OmpF was 7 by 11 A ˚(152), very
close to the estimate of a diameter of 12 A ˚from sugar diffusion
studies (see above).
(v) The nature of the residues lining the channel wall pro-
vided a reasonable explanation of the diffusion characteristicsthrough porins. Thus, OmpF and PhoE prefer cations andanions, respectively, despite having a 72% similarity in themature-protein sequence; this difference in charge preferencewas shown to be due mainly to the replacement of Gly131 inthe eyelet region of OmpF with the positively charged Lys125in PhoE (42, 152). The electrostatic properties of the OmpFand PhoE channels were calculated and compared (322).
The OmpC channel appears to be slightly smaller than the
OmpF channel on the basis of diffusion rates of organic mol-ecules (461, 462). Although the crystal structure of E. coli
OmpC is not yet known, the structure of an OmpC homologfrom Klebsiella pneumoniae has been determined (187). How-
ever, the size of the constriction region and the arrangement ofcharged residues there are almost exactly the same as inOmpF, and it is not easy to explain the difference in diffusionrates. Schulz has pointed out that more charged residues arepointing toward the pore lumen in OmpC (599). Perhaps thismay decrease the functional radius of the solute diffusion path-way. Molecular dynamics simulation (see below) will be valu-able in solving this question.
Lipophilicity in the solute molecule strongly retards its dif-
fusion through the porin channel (461, 462). Schulz explainedthis effect by assuming that the structure of eyelet, in which thecationic and anionic amino acid residues are located in theopposite sides of the channel (Fig. 2C), orients the water mol-ecules in the channels in a highly directional manner, makingthe disruption of this ordered structure by hydrophobic solutesenergetically unfavorable (597).
OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE are so strongly similar in sequence
and also in their three-dimensional structure (as shown exper-imentally for OmpF and PhoE [152]) that they apparently form
mixed trimers almost at random (217).
Regulation of porin expression. The regulation of expression
of nonspeci ﬁc porins in E. coli is brie ﬂy summarized. PhoE is
expressed only under phosphate starvation, since the phoE
gene is a member of the phosphate regulon (664). The expres-sion of the two major porins, OmpF and OmpC, is exquisitelyregulated. The apparent purpose of this regulation becameclear when it was discovered that OmpF produces a slightlylarger channel than OmpC (461, 462). Thus, noxious agentssuch as antibiotics and bile acids diffuse far better through thelarger OmpF channel, as seen clearly from the observation thatlow concentrations of antibiotics select for ompF mutants but
never for ompC mutants (255) (see “Porins and antibiotic
resistance ”below). In its natural habitat, the intestinal tract, E.
coli encounters 4 to 16 mM bile salts (84), and it is most
important to minimize their in ﬂux. The conditions prevailing in
the intestinal tract, high osmotic strength and high tempera-ture, both favor the production of OmpC (with its narrowerchannel) and repress the production of OmpF (259). On theother hand, the increased production of OmpF under low-temperature, low-osmolarity conditions (for example, in lakewater) will bene ﬁtE. coli by facilitating the in ﬂux of scarce
nutrients. The molecular mechanisms of this regulation havebeen studied extensively and reviewed in a clear and concisemanner (507). Thus, environmental osmotic activity is sensedby the sensor component EnvZ of the archetypal two-compo-nent system, EnvZ-OmpR, and high osmolarity results in thephosphorylation of OmpR. The ompF gene, with its high af-
ﬁnity OmpR-binding sites, is transcribed even when the phos-
phorylated OmpR is scarce (i.e., under low-osmolarity condi-tions). However, when the concentration of activated OmpRincreases, additional binding of these molecules results in in-creased transcription of ompC and repression of ompF. High
temperature, on the other hand, increases the transcription ofan antisense RNA, micF (172) (A putative regulatory protein,
EnvY, has been reported to affect the temperature regulationprocess [389], but its effect on micF transcription is not
known.) This RNA binds to the 5 /H11032-region of the ompF mRNA
and inhibits its translation. More recently, another twist wasadded to this complex regulatory network (383). When E. coli
is starved for carbon sources, OmpF production respondsstrongly to the growth rate (or the concentration of glucose inthe medium). Finally, as described below, oxidative stress andthe presence of salicylate also increase micF transcription and
prevent the production of OmpF porin posttranscriptionally.
The intestinal tract, the normal environment of E. coli ,i s
thought to be mostly anaerobic. Interestingly, anaerobiosis wasfound to modify the osmoregulation of OmpF and OmpC(406). Thus, under anaerobiosis, OmpC is expressed at a ratherhigh level even in fairly low-osmolarity media, and the repres-sion of OmpF by osmotic activity occurs more strongly thanunder aerobic conditions. This modi ﬁcation of the regulatory
response, which is expected to favor the survival of E. coli in
the intestinal tract, occurs through the cross talk activation ofOmpR by the ArcB sensor, which senses the anaerobiccondition.
Another environmental factor that acts in some cases
through the EnvZ-OmpR system is the medium pH (270). Atan acidic pH, such as 5.2, the production of OmpF porin
VOL. 67, 2003 MOLECULAR BASIS OF OUTER MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY 599becomes strongly repressed and the expression of OmpC be-
comes increased. This acid induction phenomenon is quitecomplex (658) and is affected additionally by the nature of thecarbon source. A partial explanation of this effect may be thedirect phosphorylation of OmpR by acetyl phosphate (269).What advantage would the increased synthesis of OmpC con-fer to the bacterium trying to survive in an acidic environment?In terms of proton in ﬂux, the small difference in the channel
size between OmpF and OmpC is unlikely to produce anysigni ﬁcant difference in in ﬂux. Perhaps a critical factor for
survival under acid-stressed conditions is the neutralization ofthe periplasm, achieved by the decarboxylation of glutamate inthe cytoplasm followed by the export of /H9253-aminobutyrate into
the periplasm, where it may act as a buffer (83). In this sce-nario, the narrower channel of OmpC may contribute to theretention of these buffer molecules in the periplasm. The clo-sure of porin channels by low pH and by endogenously syn-thesized polyamines produced under acid stress (see “Regula-
tion of porin function ”below) may also help in the same way.
The acid response involving OmpR also involves, in Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium, the downstream two-compo-
nent regulatory system SsrAB, encoded by the genes in patho-genicity island 2, and is essential for the survival of this speciesinside macrophages (34, 368).
Regulation of porin expression also occurs in response to
chemicals in the environment. It was found in 1991 that salic-ylate in the medium decreased OmpF synthesis (560). This isnow known to be a part of the global regulation of porinsmediated by three XylS-AraC family regulatory proteins,MarA, SoxS, and Rob (9, 174). Thus, the increased productionof MarA (caused by some environmental chemicals, such assalicylate, inactivating its cognate repressor, MarR) or SoxS(caused by the inactivation of its repressor SoxR via its oxida-tion) or the binding of coregulators such as dipyridyl (561) orsome bile salts (558) to Rob activates the transcription of micF
antisense RNA, decreasing OmpF synthesis. Interestingly, allthese environmental signals also result in the increased pro-duction of the main multidrug ef ﬂux pump, AcrAB. Together,
these responses result in prevention of the in ﬂux of toxic mol-
ecules, a reasonable response for E. coli. The bene ﬁt is clear
from the observation that resistance to several antibiotics ismoderately increased in the presence of bile salts (558), anormal component of the environment of E. coli.
A very interesting possibility is that R plasmids could bring
in a new regulatory element that would repress porin synthesis,making the bacteria generally more resistant to drugs. An earlyexample is the ﬁnding by Iyer and coworkers (289, 290) that N
compatibility group R plasmids decrease drastically the syn-thesis of OmpF porin when introduced into E. coli. Although
Iyer favored the interpretation that the preexisting ompF mu-
tants acted as a better recipient for the plasmids, it seems morelikely that the plasmid contains a gene that represses OmpFsynthesis. I am not aware of other studies in this potentiallyimportant area, except that Rossouw and Rowbury (562)showed that the presence of F compatibility group plasmidR124 resulted in the repression of OmpF, causing increasedresistance to many agents.
Porin mutants. Benson et al. (49) used an ingenious ap-
proach to isolate porin mutants that allowed the diffusion oflarge maltodextrins, which cannot diffuse through the wild-typeOmpF channel at signi ﬁcant rates. These mutations changed
the large, charged residues (Arg82 or Asp113 in the poreconstriction [Fig. 2C]) into residues with smaller side chains,such as serine, cysteine, or glycine, or resulted in short, in-frame deletions of the L3 loop (152). The crystal structure ofthese mutant proteins con ﬁrmed the enlargement of the eyelet
(387) as expected. Surprisingly, the single-channel conduc-tance in 1 M NaCl was not increased in any of the mutantporins (571). This observation emphasizes the danger of usingsingle-channel conductance uncritically as the indicator forchannel size (described in “Functional assays ”above). Con-
ductance is affected by the selectivity of the channel for cationsversus anions, and the total conductance is the sum of complexfactors. Indeed, a liposome-swelling assay with disaccharidesunequivocally showed that the mutant channels were largerthan the wild-type channels (571). Similar, larger-channel mu-tants were also isolated in OmpC (419), and the enlargementof the channels was con ﬁrmed by biochemical studies (555).
In an interesting case, selection of colicin-N-resistant mu-
tants of E. coli produced a strain in which the Gly119 residue
of OmpF was mutated to Asp (305). This change essentiallydivided the constriction zone of the channel into two smallerchannels, and drastically reduced the permeation rates of bothions and sugars.
Site-directed mutagenesis studies were carried out with sam-
ples containing residues lining the eyelet region. However, theresults are not always easy to interpret. In one example inwhich the channel assay was accompanied by a structural de-termination by X-ray crystallography (590), an attempt wasmade to narrow the eyelet of the Rhodopseudomonas blastica
porin (351) by replacing the residues surrounding the eyeletwith bulky tryptophan. The introduction of two or three tryp-tophan residues narrowed the eyelet and indeed decreasedsingle-channel conductance, as expected. However, the intro-duction of four or six tryptophan residues produced unstableproteins. Similarly, replacement of four eyelet-surroundingresidues with alanine produced only a marginal (17%) increasein eyelet cross-section in the X-ray structure, apparently be-cause the remaining arginine side chain assumed a more ex-panded conformation and narrowed the eyelet. The study byBenson et al. of OmpF mutants (49), mentioned above, wasrecently complemented by that of site-directed mutants (494).Thus, converting the three arginine residues at the eyelet intoa much smaller alanine and converting the glutamate and as-partate residues nearby to uncharged glutamine and aspara-gine (see Fig. 2C for the location of these residues) produceda 77% enlargement in the eyelet opening, as judged by crys-tallography. However, the single-channel conductance of thisOmpF mutant was decreased by 30% in comparison to that ofthe wild-type protein (494). Liposome swelling assay with di-saccharides, however, showed that the permeation rates ofthese large sugars was about eight times higher in the mutant.
Functional studies with new approaches. Computer simula-
tion of Brownian movement of cations and anions throughchannels (589) has become a valuable tool in the study ofwild-type and mutant porins. This approach rather accuratelypredicted the conductance behavior of various mutants withsite-directed mutations at the eyelet region of OmpF (494).These analyses do have restrictions, however: only a single ionwas usually observed, so that ion-to-ion interaction was ne-
600 NIKAIDO MICROBIOL .M OL.BIOL.REV.glected, the protein was assumed to have a rigid structure, and
the simulation still assumed that each ion behaves as an unhy-drated, naked ion. In the most recent studies by Im and Roux(286, 287), most of these limitations were overcome. Thus, amolecular dynamics simulation involving more than 70,000 at-oms, including an OmpF trimer, more than 100 phospholipidmolecules, 13,470 water molecules, and 231 K
/H11001ions, and 201
Cl/H11002ions was carried out. Observations of great interest from
this simulation include the following. (i) The channel is re-markably ef ﬁcient in taking up monovalent cations even from
micromolar solutions. (ii) The constriction “eyelet ”of the
channel is very stable and shows no sign of closing duringsimulation. (iii) Water molecules are strongly ordered at theeyelet region, as predicted earlier (597). A recent analysiscombining molecular dynamics simulation with planar bilayerstudies suggests also that cations bind to an anionic sidechain(s) on the eyelet, most importantly Asp113, and that thisbinding is signi ﬁcant in the cation penetration across the chan-
nel (158). Therefore, the diffusion of preferred solutes throughthe nonspeci ﬁc porin channels occurs by a mechanism similar
to that through the speci ﬁc channels (see “Speci ﬁc channels ”
below), in the sense that both involve solute (ligand) binding tothe channel wall. The difference between nonspeci ﬁc porins
and speci ﬁc channels has now become quantitative rather than
qualitative.
Atomic force microscopy has proven to be a useful tool to
examine the porin surface (583). Recently, observation in lowionic strength solution detected the electrostatic potential onthe surface of porin trimers with very good resolution (496).This may be a valuable method of determining the electrostaticpotentials on the surface of various proteins.
Single-channel experiments can now be carried out with
much re ﬁnement, so that it is possible to observe the clogging
caused by the partitioning of polyethylene glycol into theOmpF channel (563). Here polyethylene glycol 1360 was thecutoff size for the OmpF porin, in comparison with polyethyl-ene glycol 2200, which was the cutoff size for a larger, staph-ylococcal alpha-toxin channel, a result showing excellent agree-ment with the known diameters of these channels. Even moreimpressively, transient clogging of the channel accompanyingthe diffusion of antibiotic ampicillin through the OmpF chan-nel could be observed and analyzed in single-channel experi-ments (440).
Voltage gating. Planar lipid ﬁlm reconstitution of porins
showed from the earliest days that the channel can be closed(“gated ”) at high voltage, typically 100 mV or more (see ref-
erence 464 and references therein). Much effort has thus beenspent in understanding the structural basis of the gating phe-nomenon. According to one hypothesis (103), transmembranevoltages make the channel narrower by bringing the cationicand anionic amino acid side chains closer to each other withinthe channel. As mentioned above, the constriction zone, oreyelet, of OmpF and PhoE contain acidic residues on the L3loop and basic residues on the facing barrel wall (Fig. 2C).Therefore, the movement of the loop containing the acidicresidues in response to voltage is in principle possible, asshown by theoretical analysis (710). However, when the loopwasﬁxed to the barrel wall by a disul ﬁde bond, the gating still
occurred (29, 194, 492), a result that rules out at least a large-scale movement of the loop against the barrel wall. Smallmovements in parts of the loop are still possible, and some
molecular dynamics simulation studies (628, 659) indeed seemto support this idea. Another possibility is the movement ofexternal loops that are located outside the channel in thecrystal structure. This mechanism was supported by an atomicforce microscopy study, in which the application of voltage wasshown to cause the movement of external loops, resulting inthe closure of channel entrance (433). With Haemophilus in-
ﬂuenzae porin, which shows signi ﬁcant sequence homology to
E. coli porins (Fig. 1), this idea was supported by site-directed
mutagenesis as well as chemical modi ﬁcation of basic amino
acid residues in the external loops (20, 21, 157).
When the results did not favor the movement of loop 3 in
gating, some workers took a broader look and considered thefact that even the channel made by the /H9251-toxin",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to study the voltage gating mechanism in bacterial porins.,"Research Hypothesis:
The voltage gating mechanism in bacterial porins is regulated by the movement of external loops in response to transmembrane voltages, resulting in the closure of the channel entrance.

Research Proposal:
The proposed research aims to investigate the structural basis of the voltage gating phenomenon in bacterial porins. The study will focus on understanding the mechanism by which transmembrane voltages regulate the channel opening and closing. This will involve molecular dynamics simulations, atomic force microscopy, and site-directed mutagenesis to examine the movement of external loops and the role of specific amino acid residues in the gating process. The research will provide valuable insights into the functional dynamics of bacterial porins and contribute to the understanding of their voltage-dependent behavior."

Summary
During the generation of a successful adaptive immune response, multiple molecular signals are
required. A primary signal is the binding of cognate antigen to an antigen receptor expressed by T
and B lymphocytes. Multiple secondary signals involve the engagement of costimulatory
molecules expressed by T and B lymphocytes with their respective ligands. Because of its
essential role in immunity, one of the best characterized of the costimulatory molecules is the
receptor CD40. This receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, is expressed
by B cells, professional antigen-presenting cells, as well as non-immune cells and tumors. CD40
binds its ligand CD40L, which is transiently expressed on T cells and other non-immune cells
under inflammatory conditions. A wide spectrum of molecular and cellular processes is regulated
by CD40 engagement including the initiation and progression of cellular and humoral adaptive
immunity. In this review, we describe the downstream signaling pathways initiated by CD40 and
overview how CD40 engagement or antagonism modulates humoral and cellular immunity.
Lastly, we discuss the role of CD40 as a target in harnessing anti-tumor immunity. This review
underscores the essential role CD40 plays in adaptive immunity.

Introduction
In the initiation of an adaptive immune response, multiple signals are necessary. A primary
signal is the engagement of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), with polypeptides derived
from a protein presented in the context of major histocompatability complex II (MHC II) on
the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the binding of native antigen to a cognate
B-cell receptor (BCR) complex expressed by B cells. Subsequent secondary signals involve
the engagement of costimulatory molecules expressed as receptor and ligand pairs between
T cells and APCs and between B cells and T cells, with CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed by
activated T cells engaging CD40 expressed by B cells and APCs (1). Other accessory signals
are necessary: the secretion of cytokines functioning to further enhance, modify, and skew
the responding effector cells. Although T-cell priming and B-cell activation can occur in

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptabsence of CD40 signals, many cellular and immune functions are defective in the absence
of this interaction, underscoring the importance of this ligand/receptor pair in the
development of adaptive immunity (2).
Costimulatory molecules are broadly divided into two groups based on their respective
homologies to founding members. The CD28/B7 family includes CD28 and cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and binds to its ligands CD80 and CD86 (3). The tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) family, of which CD40 is a member, also includes
TNFR superfamily member 4 (OX40); TNFR superfamily member 13c (BAFF-R); TNFR
superfamily member 13b; (TACI), TNFR superfamily member 17 (BCMA); and TNFR
superfamily member 11a (RANK) (4). Costimulatory molecules can be further subdivided
based on function. For example, molecules containing positive costimulatory function can
be grouped together, such as CD40L to CD40 binding, or negative costimulatory function,
i.e. CTLA-4 binding CD80/CD86 (5).
The costimulatory receptor CD40 is a 48-kDa type I transmembrane protein and contains a
193 amino acid (aa) extracellular domain, 21 aa leader sequence, 22 aa transmembrane
domain, and a 62 aa intracellular domain in human (90 aa in mouse) (6). In the extracellular
domain of CD40, there are 22 cysteine residues that are conserved between the members of
the TNFR superfamily (6). In regard to expression pattern, CD40 was initially characterized
on B cells and is also expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, platelets, and
macrophages as well as by non-hematopoietic cells such as myofibroblasts, fibroblasts,
epithelial, and endothelial cells (7–9).
The ligand of CD40, known as CD154 or CD40L, is a type II transmembrane protein, with a
variable molecular weight between 32 and 39 kDa because of post-translation modifications
(6). A soluble form of CD40L has been reported that expresses activities similar to the
transmembrane form (10, 11). CD40L is a member of the TNF superfamily and is
characterized by a sandwich extracellular structure that is composed of a ²-sheet, ±-helix
loop, and a ²-sheet (12). This structure allows for the trimerization of CD40L, which is also
a feature of the TNF family of ligands (12). CD40L is expressed primarily by activated T
cells, as well as activated B cells and platelets; and under inflammatory conditions is also
induced on monocytic cells, natural killer cells, mast cells, and basophils (13). The wide
expression of this costimulatory pair indicates the pivotal roles they play in different cellular
immune processes.
CD40L/CD40 interactions exert profound effects on DCs, B cells, and endothelial cells,
among many cells of the hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic compartments. It has been
demonstrated that CD40 engagement on the surface of DCs promotes their cytokine
production, the induction of costimulatory molecules on their surface, and facilitates the
cross-presentation of antigen (2). Overall, the impact of CD40 signaling ‘licenses’ DCs to
mature and achieve all of the necessary characteristics to effectively trigger T-cell activation
and differentiation. CD40 signaling of B cells promotes germinal center (GC) formation,
immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching, somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the Ig to enhance
affinity for antigen, and finally the formation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells
(14). Moreover, it has been shown that the CD40 pathway is essential for the survival of
many cell types including GC B cells, DCs, and endothelial cells under normal and
inflammatory conditions (15). In a pathogenic setting, the deregulation of CD40 signaling
has been observed in multiple autoimmunity diseases. Together, this breadth of functions for
CD40 underline the importance this receptor contains during the generation of an acquired
immune response (2).Elgueta et al. Page 2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptIn this review, we describe CD40 signaling and the pathways implicated in this process and
discuss work detailing the role of CD40 signaling in both humoral and cellular immune
responses. Lastly, we will describe how CD40 targeting has led to novel anti-tumor
therapies.
TRAF-dependent and -independent CD40 signaling
The engagement of CD40 by CD40L promotes the clustering of CD40 and induces the
recruitment of adapter proteins known TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) to the cytoplasmic
domain of CD40 (15). The TRAF proteins activate different signaling pathways including
the canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor ºB (NFºB)-signaling pathways, the mitogen-
activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), as well as the
phospholipase C ³ (PLC³) pathway (15). Recent evidence indicates that signaling may occur
independent of the TRAF proteins, as well as with Janus family kinase 3 (Jak3), which was
found to be able to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of CD40. Binding of Jak3 has
been shown to induce the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription
5 (STAT5) (16, 17). Together, these complex pathways elicit the essential signals mediated
through CD40 to impart its diverse cellular processes (Fig. 1).
Perhaps the best-characterized signaling pathways initiated during CD40 activation are the
canonical and non-canonical NF ºB pathways, which lie downstream of the recruitment of
the TRAF proteins to the CD40 cytoplasmic domains. The canonical NF ºB pathway begins
with the formation of the inhibitor of ºB (IºB) kinase (IKK) complex, containing the
catalytic subunits IKK ±, IKK², and the regulatory subunits IKK ³ or NEMO. The activation
of NFºB leads to the ubiquitin and proteasomal-dependent degradation of the I ºB complex,
inducing the translocation of NF ºB heterodimers p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel to the nucleus. The
non-canonical NF ºB pathway is induced when the protein kinase NF ºB-inducing kinase
(NIK) activates IKK ±, leading to a limited proteolysis of the precursor p100 that produces
p52 protein, which associates with avian rel B and translocates into the nucleus. The result is
that both signaling pathways can lead and regulate different target genes (18).
The TRAF family contains six members, designated TRAF1 through TRAF6, with all
members driving cellular processes upon TNFR family engagement with their respective
ligands. Characteristic of all TRAFs, members have a highly conserved carboxyl domain,
which is called the TRAF domain. Upon ligand engagement, TRAF proteins are recruited to
canonical aa motifs contained in the cytoplasmic domains of the TNFR family, with the
TRAF domain engaging its cognate aa motif located in the TNFR cytoplasmic domains.
TRAF proteins, with exception of TRAF1, contain an amino-terminal ring finger domain
followed by five zinc fingers and a coiled-coil domain, with this structure called the zinc
finger domain. The genetic ablation of the zinc finger domain generates a dominant negative
TRAF protein that inhibits any induction of signaling mediated by the normal TRAF,
demonstrating that this domain is essential for signaling (15).
Upon engagement with CD40L, CD40 directly or indirectly recruits TRAF1, TRAF2,
TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6 to its cytoplasmic domains. The canonical consensus binding
sites for TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 are situated at the membrane distal domain of the
intracellular tail of CD40 and is demarcated by the aa sequence PxQxT (19, 20). The
insertion of mutations at the PxQxT domain disrupts the binding of TRAF2/3 to the CD40
cytoplasmic tail and dampens CD40 signaling by abrogating the NF ºB, MAPK8 (Jnk), and
p38 pathways during ligand engagement (21, 22). Our laboratory found a second, non-
canonical binding site for TRAF2 at the carboxy-terminus of CD40 tail (23). Through this
TRAF2 binding site, NF ºB signaling is capable of being induced to control several B-cell
functions (24). TRAF6 is recruited to the membrane proximal domain of CD40 to theElgueta et al. Page 3

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptconsensus sequence QxPxEx (15). Through recruitment of TRAF proteins and their binding
to different sites of CD40, TRAFs are essential in driving CD40-mediated signaling.
By elucidating the crystal structure of a portion of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail bound to
TRAF2, McWhirter et al. (25) revealed the complexity behind the conformational changes
driven by CD40L engagement by revealing the oligomerization that occurs with CD40 in
complex with TRAF2. Upon engagement with CD40L, a conformational change occurs in
CD40 that exposes the docking site for TRAF2 at the canonical motif, and thus a trimeric
TRAF2 is able to interact with three cytoplasmic tails of CD40 (25). In order to drive
fulminant CD40 signaling, higher levels of oligomerization are required than trimerization,
and it is likely that these different orders of oligomerization may result in differential
recruitment of adapter and kinase proteins, particularly those that bind with low affinity to
the cytoplasmic domains of CD40 such as TRAF1 or TRAF6 (26, 27). These differences in
oligomerization likely account for the breadth of biologic activities induced by different
monoclonal antibodies to CD40 (28).
TRAF1 protein expression is heightened during CD40 (29, 30). There is evidence
demonstrating that TRAF1, as a result of the absence of a zinc finger domain, plays an
important role in regulating the signaling of the other TRAF proteins (15). The TRAF1
binding site motif contained by CD40 overlaps with the binding sites for TRAF2 and
TRAF3, and it appears that TRAF1 can bind weakly to the CD40 cytoplasmic domains in
the absence of TRAF2 (20). The physiological implications of this observation are unclear.
In APCs deficient in TRAF1, a reduction is observed in the recruitment of TRAF2 to the
cytoplasmic domain of CD40, with a corresponding increase of TRAF2 degradation (31).
These results were confirmed by Xie et al. (32) when it was demonstrated that CD40
stimulation of a B-cell line deficient in TRAF1 increases the amount of TRAF2 recruited to
lipid rafts and increases the degradation of TRAF2 and TRAF3. In addition, data presented
demonstrate that the recruitment of both TRAF1 and TRAF2 to CD40, during CD40L
engagement, is required for activation of the canonical NF ºB pathway. This was shown
using B-cell line deficient for TRAF2 and TRAF1, which exhibit attenuated activation of
canonical NF ºB compared with single TRAF-knockout B cells (32). Together, these results
suggest that TRAF1 can interact and regulate the recruitment and degradation of TRAF2.
Moreover, both TRAF proteins can cooperate in the activation of the canonical NF ºB
pathway.
During CD40 engagement, the recruitment of TRAF2 to the tail of CD40 leads to the
activation of the Jnk, p38, and thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (Akt) pathways. This was
shown using TRAF2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and B cells, which
exhibited attenuated activation of these pathways upon CD40 engagement (33–35). Similar
results were observed in B cells transfected with a dominant negative TRAF2 (34). The
engagement of CD40 induces the recruitment of TRAF2 with the kinase mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) to CD40 tail. In experiments where CD40 was
engaged on B cells lacking MEKK1, the activation of Jnk and p38 was blunted (36).
MEKK1 drives the phosphorylation of Jnk and p38 and thus activates these respective
pathways (36).
Despite its activating role in the aforementioned pathways, TRAF2 appears to be a negative
regulator of the non-canonical NF ºB pathway. The ablation of TRAF2 induces the
accumulation of NIK in MEFs (37). Recent studies have elegantly demonstrated that TRAF2
cooperates with TRAF3 to constitutively degrade NIK, with engagement of another TNFR,
BAFF-R, releasing this degradation and allowing for activation of the non-canonical NF ºB
pathway (38). It is clear that engagement of CD40 activates this pathway in a similar
mechanism. Without CD40 stimulation, a complex is formed between family members ofElgueta et al. Page 4
Immunol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 November 13.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptthe cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) 1 and 2, which interact with TRAF2, and which in
turn interacts with TRAF3 and NIK (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, cIAP1/2 induces the
degradation of NIK and antagonizes the non-canonical NF ºB pathway (39, 40). In contrast,
after CD40/CD40L engagement, the complex is destabilized, leading the recruitment of
TRAF2 and TRAF3 to the cytoplasmic domains of CD40, with activation of the non-
canonical NF ºB pathway resulting from the subsequent accumulation of NIK as a result of
TRAF2 and TRAF3 degradation following recruitment to CD40 (15). The degradation of
TRAF2 is the result of self-degradation, because of its E3-ubiquitin ligase property, whereas
TRAF3 degradation is dependent of cIAP1/cIAP2 (40, 41). Together, these results show that
cIAP1/2 has a dual role in CD40 signaling, that in a steady state, cIAP1/2 inhibits the non-
canonical NF ºB signaling by degradation of NIK, whereas upon CD40 activation, cIAP1/2
promotes TRAF3 degradation, which releases NIK and promotes activation of the
alternative NF ºB pathway.
Initial descriptions of the role TRAF3 plays in CD40 signaling proposed that it functioned as
a negative regulator of the canonical NF ºB pathway (42). This hypothesis was based on
experiments where a TRAF3-dominant negative protein expressed in B cells leads induction
of the canonical NF ºB and Jnk signaling pathways upon CD40 engagement (42, 43). These
results were corroborated in experiments where CD40 signaling was studied in TRAF3-
deficient B cells; it was also observed that Jnk phosphorylation and an accumulation of NIK
was enhanced, as well as the recruitment of TRAF2 to lipid rafts suggesting that TRAF3
regulates TRAF2 and NIK, as was discussed above (39, 40, 43). In contrast, it was observed
in epithelial cells that the enforced overexpression of TRAF3 induces canonical NF ºB
signaling during CD40 stimulation, suggesting that TRAF3 has different roles in different
types of cells (44, 45). Therefore, in B cells, TRAF3 negatively regulates canonical and non-
canonical NF ºB pathways, as well as Jnk signaling; whereas in epithelial cells, it is able to
induce canonical NF ºB signaling. Additional experiments are necessary to determine the
role of TRAF3 in non-canonical NF ºB and Jnk signaling in epithelial cells.
Very little is known about the role of TRAF5 in CD40 signaling although TRAF5 is
incapable to bind directly to CD40 cytoplasmic domains. During CD40 signaling, TRAF5
forms heterotrimers with TRAF3 (15). The role of TRAF5 signaling, during CD40
stimulation, was shown in B cells treated with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for
TRAF5 or deficient for TRAF5 where canonical and non-canonical NF ºB pathways were
ablated. That is traduced in a reduction of the antibody production, proliferation,
costimulatory molecules expression (46, 47). Further experiments are necessary to fully
understand TRAF5 function in CD40 signaling.
Like other TRAF proteins, the physical interaction of TRAF6 with CD40 was demonstrated
by the yeast two-hybrid assay (15). In TRAF6-deficient MEFs or epithelial cells where
TRAF6 has been silenced by siRNA, these cells exhibited a reduction or abrogation in the
activation of canonical NF ºB, Jnk, p38, and Akt, upon CD40 engagement. Interestingly,
TRAF6 is able to interact with TRAF2 and thus regulate in a positive way CD40 signaling
(21). Recently, Rowland et al. (48) have shown that in B cells expressing CD40 void of a
TRAF6 binding site, TRAF6 was still capable of interacting with TRAF2. This suggests that
TRAF6 may still have a functional role in CD40 signaling, without binding directly to
CD40. Under these conditions, CD40 stimulation was capable of enhancing CD80
upregulation and inducing Jnk activation in comparison to B cells deficient in TRAF6.
These data implicate TRAF6 as regulating some of its physiological functions through its
interactions with TRAF2 and independent of its recruitment to the TRAF6 binding site of
CD40 (48).Elgueta et al. Page 5
Immunol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 November 13.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptCD40 can induce the recruitment of TRAF6/Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b (Cbl-b)/Casitas
B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl)/PI3K complex, which leads to Akt phosphorylation. The
members of Cbl family are adapter molecules, which have E3-ubiquiting ligase properties
(49). Depending on the cell type, they regulate positively or negatively a wide range of
kinase and adapter proteins such as PI3K, Rous sarcoma oncogene (Src) tyrosine kinases,
spleen tyrosine kinase, growth factor receptor bound protein 2, and Src homology 2 domain-
containing transforming protein C1 (49). In studies using Cbl-b-deficient DCs stimulated in
vitro  with CD40L, an ablation was observed in Akt activation without effect in the induction
of the canonical NF ºB pathway. These findings suggest that in DCs, the Akt activation is
independent of NF ºB signaling (49). As mentioned above, Cbl-b induces Akt
phosphorylation through PI3K, and after the CD40 engagement, the blocking of PI3K
abrogates Akt activation, demonstrating that in DCs, the Cbl-b activate PI3K, which induce
the phosphorylation of Akt during CD40 signaling (50).
Physiologically, the blocking of PI3K drastically affects the survival of DCs (51). The
mechanism that involves the anti-apoptotic effect of PI3K/Akt activation is dependent on the
inhibition of the pro-apoptotic proteins, caspase 9, B-cell leukemia (Bcl)/lymphoma 2-
associated agonist of cell death (50, 52, 53). Recently, a second mechanism was determined;
PI3K can activate the mammalian target of rapamycin, which induces the expression of the
anti-apoptotic protein caspase 8 and Fas-associated via death domain-like apoptosis
regulator p43 (cFLIPp43) (50). Therefore, CD40, probably through TRAF6, induces the
activation of PI3K signaling that protects the cell from apoptosis.
In contrast to the result described above, B cells deficient in Cbl-b have an increase of NF ºB
and Jnk pathways, suggesting that in B cells Cbl-b is a negative regulator of these signaling
pathways (54). In this case, Cbl-b is recruited through TRAF2 to cytoplasmic tail of CD40
and the lack of Cbl-b increase TRAF2 recruitment to CD40, showing a negative role of Cbl-
b in the recruitment of TRAF2 (54). Together, these results propose that in different cell
types, Cbl-b can regulate different pathways dependent on which TRAF proteins are
interacting.
Most of the studies investigating CD40 signaling demonstrate pathways dependent on TRAF
proteins. However, it was observed in B cells, the membrane proximal region of the CD40
tail contains a binding domain for Jak3 (55). Revy et al. (56) demonstrated that in B cells,
upon CD40 stimulation, Jak3 is not phosphorylated, suggesting that the recruitment of Jak3
to the cytoplasmic membrane of CD40 is not functional. However, monocytes are able to
induce Jak3 phosphorylation after CD40 engagement (56). Furthermore, the inhibition of
Jak3 in APCs, upon CD40 stimulation, blocks the maturation of APCs (16, 17).
Additionally, Jak3 induces the transcription factor STAT5, which can dimerize and
translocate to the nucleus, and leads the gene expression of the inflammatory cytokines, such
as TNF±, interferon- ³ (IFN-³), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (57). These results suggest that Jak3
is able to bind to CD40 and induce the maturation of DCs through STAT5.
In conclusion, CD40 principally mediates signaling through TRAF proteins, which can
activate or inhibit different signaling pathways, dependent upon the cell type. TRAF
proteins drive a wide range of cellular and immune processes and understanding these
pathways will improve our ability to develop strategies to therapeutically intervene in a vast
array of immune related diseases.
CD40 and humoral immunity
During initiation of a thymus-dependent (TD) humoral immune response, CD40 signaling
by B cells is required for the generation of high titers of isotype-switched, high affinity
antibody and for the development of humoral immune memory. The engagement of CD40Elgueta et al. Page 6
Immunol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 November 13.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptexpressed on the surface of antigen-activated B cells by CD40L expressed on activated
CD4+ T cells is essential for the initiation and progression of a TD humoral immune
response. CD40 engagement triggers B-cell intercellular adhesion, sustained proliferation,
expansion, differentiation, and antibody isotype switching in vitro  (58–61). In vivo , CD40
engagement is required for GC formation and progression, as well as antibody isotype
switching and affinity maturation, with these processes essential for the generation of
memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells (62–64). The blockade of CD40/CD40L
interactions through the use of blocking antibodies, genetic ablation of CD40L, or genetic
ablation of CD40 completely abolishes TD humoral immunity (58).
Identification of CD40/CD40L as essential for TD humoral immunity
Historically, studies in regulation TD humoral immunity have detailed an essential role for
the physical collaboration between T cells and B cells for an effective TD humoral immune
response to be generated (65). This cellular collaboration is manifest as a physical
interaction between antigen-activated B cells presenting antigen-derived peptides in the
context of MHC class II to cognate CD4+ T-helper cells (Th cells) specific for the class II-
restricted peptides being presented (66, 67). As a result of this immunological synapse, the
Th cell provides the B cell with contact-dependent and -independent stimuli. Initially, it was
thought that local release of cytokines was responsible for the ability of T cells to induce B-
cell growth and differentiation. However, cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-2, IL-10, and
IFN-³ alone or in combination were unable to reconstitute the abilities of T cells to stimulate
sustained B-cell growth and differentiation (58, 68–71). Based on these findings, it was
predicted that further cell-contact mediated mechanisms of T/B cell crosstalk existed (72).
This prediction was supported by the observation that plasma membrane fractions from
activated Th cells were capable of driving B cells into cell cycle, with this induction
occurring independent of cytokines (73–75). The molecule through which B cells receive
this contact-dependent stimulus from T cells was identified as CD40 through experiments
where agonistic monoclonal antibodies raised against CD40 were found to drive B cells into
cell cycle and by using a CD40-Ig fusion protein to antagonize the ability of plasma
membrane fractions to activate B cells in vitro  (60, 76). By using the CD40-Ig fusion
protein, CD40L expressed by activated Th cells was identified, isolated, and cloned (76, 77).
Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody was raised against CD40L that antagonized the
interactions of CD40 with CD40L both in vitro  and in vivo  (64, 76). This antibody (clone
MR1) has proven to be invaluable in studies determining the role of CD40/CD40L in the
regulation of humoral immunity.
The in vivo  role of CD40/CD40L interactions during a humoral immune response
During infection with a pathogen, either whole pathogen or its particulates enter the lymph
and the proximal draining lymphoid organs or, in the case of systemic infection, enter the
spleen through the blood. Direct encounter of cognate antigen by naive follicular (NF) B
cells residing in the B-cell follicles can occur. Alternatively, antigen can be acquired by
tissue-resident DCs in the periphery that then home to the secondary lymphoid organs and
deliver native antigen to cognate NF B cells (78–80). Lymphoid-homing DCs also present
processed antigen in the context of MHC class II to Th cells in the T-cell zones of the
secondary lymphoid organs, leading to the clonal activation of antigen-specific T cells.
CD40/CD40L interactions between antigen-presenting DCs and Th cells are essential for the
maturation and survival of DCs. In turn, the CD40-dependent maturation of DCs leads to the
sustained expansion and differentiation of antigen-specific T cells.
The response of NF B cells to TD antigen and T-cell help has been well defined as a
sequence of events that are temporally ordered. B-cell activation as defined by the induction
of a litany of cell surface molecules can be readily observed hours after TD activation.Elgueta et al. Page 7
Immunol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 November 13.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptShortly thereafter, entry into the cell cycle can be documented. These early proliferating
cells differentiate into plasmablasts secreting germline-encoded IgM and then IgG, with
these plasmablasts located outside of the B-cell follicles (days 2–12 postimmunization).
Activated B cells also seed secondary follicles and rapidly proliferate and interact with Th
cells in a GC reaction, where isotype switching and SHM of the BCR occurs (days 9–20).
GC B cells further differentiate into long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells containing
high-affinity BCRs of the switched isotypes (days 20 +) (81–83).
It is clear that CD40L plays a critical role in controlling B-cell fate during many of the
aforementioned checkpoints in B-cell growth and differentiation. When Th cells are
activated by DCs within the T-cell zone during a primary TD response, they transiently
express CD40L (84). These activated Th cells then home toward the B-cell follicles and
position themselves at the border of the B-cell follicles and T-cell zone where they
encounter activated and cognate B cells, with CD40/CD40L interactions occurring between
the two cell types (85). Th cells expressing CD40L are detectable at high frequencies by
days 2–5 after immunization and co-localize with plasmablasts secreting antibody specific
for the immunizing antigen in the T-cell zone (84). Th cells expressing CD40L are essential
in activating NF B cells to differentiate into plasmablasts as blockade of CD40/CD40L
interactions between responding Th cells and cognate B cells completely ablates the
plasmablast response (64). In contrast to the TD immune response, abrogation of the CD40/
CD40L pathway has no impact on the thymus-independent (TI) antibody response. When
mice are immunized against the TI-type II antigen TNP-Ficoll, no difference in the strength
of the humoral immune response is seen between mice treated either with anti-CD40L
antibody or with control antibody (64). Similar results were observed in studies comparing
the ability of CD40L knockout mice to mount an immune response to TNP-Ficoll in
comparison to wildtype mice (86). In summation, CD40 signaling in antigen-responding B
cells is essential for their differentiation into plasmablasts in response to a TD antigen.
CD40/CD40L interactions in the initiation and progression of the GC
In parallel to the plasmablast response, a subset of oligoclonal antigen-responding NF B
cells which have been similarly activated in the T-cell zones colonize the B-cell follicles
where they form GC structures (81, 83). The fate of whether a responding B cell
differentiates into a plasmablast or whether it seeds a GC is dictated by a number of B-cell
intrinsic or extrinsic factors. The intrinsic factors include the germline-encoded affinity of
the B cell for antigen, with this affinity exerting a tremendous impact on B-cell fate. That is,
high initial affinity BCR tends to drive the B cells into the plasma-blast lineage, whereas
moderate affinity imprints the B cells to seed the GC (87–90). Extensive triggering via
CD40/CD40L is an example of a cell extrinsic factor that modifies B-cell fate. There clearly
is a range of CD40 signaling that is ‘acceptable’ in inducing a GC response. In the absence
of CD40 stimulation, no GC response is observed. As CD40L signaling is provided, a GC
response initiates and matures. However, in the presence of enhanced CD40 stimuli during a
primary immune response, either with agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies or elevated T-cell
help, B cells are selectively triggered to differentiate down the plasmablast lineage and
divert from a GC response (91). In this situation of agonistic anti-CD40, the antigen-
responding B cells uniformly differentiate into plasmablasts localized outside of the B-cell
follicles, and no GC is formed. A similar scenario, albeit to a less severe degree, occurs
when the numbers of activated, cognate T cells are enhanced by an order of magnitude.
After priming with the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 7 days prior to
immunization with the hapten/carrier (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl conjugated to KLH
to simulate enhanced T-cell help, responding B cells are again shuttled from seeding a GC
and instead differentiate into plasmablasts; although in this case GCs do appear (91). It isElgueta et al. Page 8

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptclear that the strength and duration of a CD40 signal, while required for the onset of humoral
immunity, also has a substantial impact on the fate of antigen-responding B cells (91).
Once committed to the GC lineage, B cells encounter a specialized subset of activated Th
cells called T follicular helper cells (T FH cells), that provide the necessary cytokine and cell-
contact signals, including CD40L, required to sustain the GC reaction (92–94). By means
yet unclear, after T/B-cell encounter at the edges of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath and
B-cell follicles, a subset of activated Th cells further differentiate into T FH cells and are
licensed to enter the B-cell follicles by the heightened expression of the chemokine receptor
chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 5 (CXCR5) (93, 95). The chemokine ligand for CXCR5
is chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), and this chemokine coordinates the
positioning and structure of the B-cell follicles as mature B cells, which express CXCR5
(96–100). T FH cells are characterized by their expression of CD40L, ICOS, CXCR5 and the
secretion of the cytokine IL-21, which stimulates B-cell proliferation, isotype switching, and
differentiation into plasma cells (93). CD40L has been shown to be critical for T FH cells
function.
As the GC reaction matures, the structure becomes polarized into light and dark zones, with
each zone situated to play a role in GC B-cell competition for antigen and T-cell help (83).
The GC dark zone is so named because of the presence of a high density of rapidly dividing
B cells, called GC centroblasts, whose large nuclei project a dark appearance during
histological analysis. It is at the GC dark zone that SHM occurs (101). The GC dark zone is
maintained by the chemokine, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), with this
chemokine secreted by the resident stromal cells (102). Accordingly, the receptor for this
chemokine, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), is expressed on GC centroblasts
(102, 103). The GC light zone is situated at the pole of antigen entry, and within this zone
resides follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) on which antigen complexes are tethered by binding
complement receptors CD21 and CD35 and the Fc ³RIIb (104). At the GC light zone, FDCs
and light zone stromal cells secrete CXCL13 and it is here that T FH cells are found (102,
103). GC B cells residing in the light zone are called centrocytes and are characterized by
the expression of CXCR5 (102). Within the GC light zone, the interactions between
centrocytes, T FH cells, and complexed antigen occur in a critical competition and result in
the selection of centrocytes exhibiting the highest affinities for antigen, as they receive
survival and differentiation signals through their BCR and through CD40 engagement. It
should be noted that the role of immune complexes on FDC in affinity maturation has been
brought into question by Shlomchik and coworkers (105).
GC B cells expressing BCRs exhibiting inferior affinities for antigen are deleted by Fas-
dependent apoptosis as they do not receive sufficient BCR and CD40 survival signals. The
engagement of CD40 by a GC centrocyte during a productive immune synapse with a T FH
cell induces cellular survival. This was initially shown in studies observing that GC B cells
could be rescued in vitro  with the administration of agonistic anti-CD40 antibody or CD40L
(106, 107). The engagement of CD40 by centrocytes protects the cell from undergoing Fas-
mediated apoptosis by inducing the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl/B-cell lymphoma × (Bcl-XL)
and c-FLIP (108–110). It is clear that T FH cells provide centrocytes with signals in addition
to CD40L in order to propagate survival and differentiation to memory and plasma cells,
with IL-21 occupying such a role in PC differentiation (93). Classic in vitro  studies by
MacLennan and coworkers (106) observed that centrocytes are induced to differentiate into
memory B cells upon culture with activated memory Th cells but not activated naive Th
cells, indicating that further signals may exist (106). How these other signals, which are
derived from T FH impact centrocyte differentiation into memory B cells and PCs are in the
process of being elucidated.Elgueta et al. Page 9

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptCD40 signaling from activated T cells at the inductive phase of the GC response as well as
from T FH cells throughout the duration of the GC response is essential for the completion of
the GC response. Blockade of CD40/CD40L interactions or genetic ablation of the CD40L
or CD40 gene prevents the clonal proliferation of antigen-responding B cells as well as
blocks the generation of the GC structure by preventing these cells from receiving signals
from activated Th cells through CD40 (63, 64, 86). As such, if anti-CD40L antibody is
injected at the peak of the GC response, the GC is immediately shut down (111). After anti-
CD40L antibody administration, the Ig affinity of the plasma cells in the bone marrow was
decreased in comparison to control antibody-treated mice, supporting the hypotheses that (i)
affinity maturation occurs in the GC and progresses over time, and (ii) CD40/CD40L
interactions are essential for this progression. Together, these data indicate that CD40
signaling initiates and propagates the GC, and that abrogating this reaction through CD40
block prevents the full benefits of the GC, as measured by affinity maturation.
The contributions of TRAF recruitment during CD40 signaling on B-cell fate
Early events in the CD40 signaling cascade control the fate of antigen-specific B cells. Upon
CD40 multimerization by CD40L, TRAFs are recruited to the CD40 cytoplasmic tail as
discussed in detail earlier in this review. The respective contributions of TRAFs 1, 2, 3, 5,
and 6 recruitment to CD40 in regulating humoral immunity was studied in vivo  by
generating transgenic mice containing CD40 receptors with mutations in defined CD40
binding sites for TRAFs (24, 112–114). Upon CD40L binding to CD40, TRAF2 and TRAF3
directly bind to the cytoplasmic tail of CD40. TRAF1 and TRAF 5 are also recruited to
CD40 through indirect associations with CD40-bound TRAFs (20, 115, 116). Through
disruption of TRAF6-binding site within the CD40 cytoplasmic domain, we selectively
ablated affinity maturation and the generation of plasma cells after immunization.
Mutagenesis of both the TRAF6 and TRAF2–TRAF3 sites was essential for arresting GC
formation in response to immunization. CD40-induced B-cell proliferation and early Ig
production occurred even when all TRAF sites were ablated. These studies demonstrated
that specific CD40–TRAF associations control well-defined aspects of humoral immunity
(112). The fact that the B-cell proliferative response was intact in mice where both the
TRAF2–TRAF3 and TRAF6 sites were ablated suggested another functional site in the
CD40 cytoplasmic tail. Indeed, our laboratory identified a second non-canonical TRAF2
binding motif in the C-terminus of CD40 (23, 24). All early B-cell activation events,
including plasmablast generation are intact in the transgenic mice that express only the c-
terminal TRAF2 binding motif in the CD40 tail. When immunized with T-dependent
antigen, the mice are still impaired to develop GC demonstrating that either or both, TRAF3
and TRAF6 are necessary to form GC structures (23, 24). In summary, TRAFs are essential
intermediaries in CD40-induced humoral immunity.
Perhaps the most striking example of how essential CD40/CD40L interacts are in generating
humoral immunity is the clinical manifestations that arise in humans carrying mutations in
the CD40L gene which generate non-functional CD40L. This syndrome is X-linked hyper-
IgM syndrome and is characterized by reduced levels of serum IgG, IgA, and IgE and
increased levels of IgM (117). Because of inactivation of functional CD40L, TD immune
responses in these patients are severely impaired, including the generation of GCs, memory
B cells, and isotype-switched plasma cells secreting protective antibody. Patients with
CD40L deficiency are thus susceptible to life-threatening bacterial infections. Thus, the
importance of CD40/CD40L interactions in controlling humoral immunity has been
displayed in an unfortunate clinical presentation.Elgueta et al. Page 10

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe role of CD40/CD40L in cell-mediated immunity
There is little doubt as to the essential role of CD40/CD40L in the development of TD
humoral immunity. While initially thought to be only involved in regulating TD immunity,
CD40/CD40L is also critical in the development of cell-mediated immunity (CMI). There is
clear and unquestionable evidence that the development of some CMI responses require
CD40/CD40L (118). This is most evident in the role of this ligand–receptor pair in the
development of cytotoxic T cells to tumors, virus, and alloantigens (119, 120) and its role in
the development of a litany of T-cell-dependent autoimmune diseases (121). In this review,
we discuss its role in regulating allograft tolerance and rejection, as a model that clearly
delineates the role of this ligand–receptor pair in controlling critical checkpoints in the
development of CMI.
One of the first pathways to be targeted in an attempt to modify allograft rejection was the
CD28/B7 pathway. It was demonstrated that by using a CTLA-4-Ig (a soluble form of the
high-affinity receptor to B7 molecules), long-term allograft survival of islet cells (122, 123)
and cardiac allografts (124) could be achieved. By competitively binding to B7 molecules,
CTLA-4-Ig blocked CD28 signaling to the T cells, therefore limiting activation of the
alloreactive T-cell compartment. Other means by which to disrupt T-cell activation have
been through the blockade of the CD40/CD40L pathway. Originally, it was thought that
anti-CD40L antibody monotherapy would be effective because it limited APC maturation
and downmodulated the B7–CD28 interaction, resulting in the lack of a signal 2 and T-cell
anergy (125, 126). However, anti-CD40L antibody as a monotherapy has not been
successful in inducing allograft tolerance (127, 128). Studies by Waldmann and coworkers
(129) indicate that failure to induce tolerance using antibody anti-CD40L therapy is
insufficient because of its inability to block rejection elicited by CD8+ T cells. Highly
immunogenic allografts, such as those of heart and skin, require stronger tolerogenic
therapies. Among these, the combination of costimulatory blockade with
immunosuppressive drugs (rapamycin with antibody anti-CD40L and CTLA-4-Ig) has been
shown to result in long-term graft acceptance (130). Interestingly, the effect of cyclosporine
A impedes the tolerogenic effects of anti-CD40L antibody and CTLA-4-Ig. The explanation
for this resides in the ability of cyclosporine to block IL-2 production and likely the
expansion of regulatory T cells (131).
Given the failures of anti-CD40L antibody monotherapy in many graft systems, we asked if
we could pretolerize a host to allow that host to accept an allograft. The specific system that
we and others (132–137) have exploited to understand the role of CD40L in the regulation
of graft rejection involves the pretolerization of the host with alloantigen (donor-specific
transfusion, DST) and anti-CD40L antibody, followed by grafting. In this system, donor
alloantigen is provided by an intravenous infusion of T-depleted donor splenocytes or
heparinized whole blood. When used in combination with anti-CD40L antibody, this has
been shown to induce allospecific T cell tolerance, as measured by suppression of both
CD8+ and CD4+ alloreactive T cells (127–129, 138) and enhanced persistence of allografts
of skin, kidney, pancreatic islets, heart, and lung (132–137).
The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that account for the DST and anti-
CD40L antibody T-cell tolerance have been studied (135). Studies into this phenomenon
have provided insights into the process of allospecific tolerance, peripheral tolerance, and
the role of regulatory T cells in the survival of allografts. Blockade of CD40L by anti-
CD40L antibody impairs the maturation of the host DCs (upregulation of CD80/86) and
incapacitates the abilities of these DCs from inducing productive T-cell activation. As such,
the alloantigen-presenting, non-matured DCs induce abortive activation and anergy of the
host alloreactive T-cell pool. Among the most relevant findings were that indirectElgueta et al. Page 11
Immunol Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 November 13.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptpresentation of alloantigen was essential for tolerance induction. Thus, the infused DST was
rapidly processed by host APCs and presented via indirect presentation to the host
alloreactive T cells in a tolerogenic manner because of the CD40L blockade. The
tolerogenic impact of DST and anti-CD40L antibody in this system was to induce a rapid
(days 3–4), systemic, abortive expansion of the alloreactive T cells that resulted in profound
anergy. One additional unique feature of this system was that we could quantify the
magnitude of the T-cell unresponsiveness by purifying anergic cells. In these cases, the
unresponsiveness was determined to be >95% on a per-cell basis. Hence, infusion of DST
and anti-CD40L antibody resulted in a pre-emptive induction of tolerance within the
alloreactive T-cell compartment, thereby silencing the alloreactive response days prior to the
time when the allograft had the opportunity to elicit an immune response (135).
We now envision that the infused DST rapidly undergoes apoptosis and is presented by host
APCs. It is of interest to note that anti-CD40L antibody may facilitate the apoptosis of the
DST by depriving it of a CD40 signal. At the same time, this blocking antibody impairs the
maturation of host APCs, committing them to the tolerogenic presentation of DST-derived
allopeptides. Delivery of peptides via apoptotic cells appears to be an extremely efficient
means to induce peripheral tolerance. In analogous studies, Steinman and coworkers have
shown that B cells deficient in transporter associated with antigen processing 1 protein and
hyperosmotically loaded with OVA can induce abortive expansion and anergy of OVA-
specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vivo  via indirect presentation (139). Similarly,
antigens expressed on dying pancreatic cells (140) induce tolerance via indirect presentation.
More recently, antigens targeted directly to defined DC surface molecules (such as
DEC-205) and antigens delivered to immature DCs have been shown to induce profound
antigen-specific tolerance, as predicted by these earlier studies.
CD40-dependent maturation of DCs is far more complex than simply the upregulation of
costimulatory molecules. As a consequence of CD40 signaling of DCs, there is heightened
expression and increased stability of the MHC/alloantigen complex (141, 142). Furthermore,
increased life span of the DC is considered a major factor in the success of CD40-trigger",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the impact of CD40/CD40L engagement on the induction and maintenance of allospecific T cell tolerance in the context of allograft transplantation.,"Research Hypothesis:
The engagement of CD40/CD40L in the context of allograft transplantation induces systemic, abortive expansion and anergy of alloreactive T cells, leading to allospecific T cell tolerance.

Research Proposal:
To investigate the impact of CD40/CD40L engagement on the induction and maintenance of allospecific T cell tolerance in the context of allograft transplantation, we propose a series of experiments. Firstly, we will conduct in vivo studies using a mouse model to assess the effects of donor-specific transfusion (DST) and anti-CD40L antibody on the expansion and anergy of alloreactive T cells. We will analyze the systemic response and quantify the magnitude of T-cell unresponsiveness following the treatment. Additionally, we will investigate the role of indirect presentation of alloantigen in inducing peripheral tolerance by studying the processing and presentation of DST-derived allopeptides by host antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, we will examine the impact of CD40 signaling on the maturation and antigen presentation capabilities of dendritic cells, focusing on the expression and stability of MHC/alloantigen complexes and the lifespan of dendritic cells. These experiments will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the induction of allospecific T cell tolerance through CD40/CD40L engagement in the context of allograft transplantation."

Abstract
Targeted drug delivery using functionalized nanocarriers (NCs) is a strategy in therapeutic and
diagnostic applications. In this paper we review the recent development of models at multiple
length and time scales and their applications to targeting of antibody functionalized nanocarriers to
antigens (receptors) on the endothelial cell (EC) surface. Our mesoscale (100 nm-1 μm) model is
based on phenomenological interaction potentials for receptor-ligand interactions, receptor-flexure
and resistance offered by glycocalyx. All free parameters are either directly determined from
independent biophysical and cell biology experiments or estimated using molecular dynamics
simulations. We employ a Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) strategy in conjunction with the
weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to compute the free energy landscape (potential of
mean force or PMF) associated with the multivalent antigen-antibody interactions mediating the
NC binding to EC. The binding affinities (association constants) are then derived from the PMF
by computing absolute binding free energy of binding of NC to EC, taking into account the
relevant translational and rotational entropy losses of NC and the receptors. We validate our model
predictions by comparing the computed binding affinities and PMF to a wide range of
experimental measurements, including in vitro  cell culture, in vivo  endothelial targeting, atomic
force microscopy (AFM), and flow chamber experiments. The model predictions agree closely and
quantitatively with all types experimental measurements. On this basis, we conclude that our
computational protocol represents a quantitative and predictive approach for model driven design
and optimization of functionalized NCs in targeted vascular drug delivery.

According to a recent report [1], around 10 million people in the world were newly
diagnosed with cancer in 2009. Targeted drug delivery using functionalized nanocarriers
(i.e., NCs coated with specific targeting ligands) has been clinically identified as a
promising approach in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications in cancer treatments.
However, targeting of NCs to endothelium remains an important design challenge in
pharmacological and biomedical sciences. The use of functionalized NCs offers a wide
range of tunable design parameters (size, shape, type, method of functionalization, etc.). In
principle, massive experimentation in a high-dimensional tunable parameter space is needed
to achieve optimal treatment in drug delivery applications [2]. Therefore a physiologically
sound and computationally tractable model, which is both quantitative and predictive, can
prove to be crucial in the rational design of the drug delivery using functionalized NCs.
However, the design of functionalized NCs faces many challenges due to several inherent
complexities of the underlying interactions: (i) molecular and geometric parameters
surrounding receptor-ligand interactions and NCs; (ii) lack of accurate characterization of
hydrodynamics; (iii) physico-chemical barriers for NC uptake/arrest; (iv) uncertainty in
targeting environment. Binding affinity ( Ka) is a direct measure of the efficiency of
targeting. Recently Muro et al.  [3] have experimentally studied the binding affinity of
functionalized NCs to ICAM-1expressing EC surface in which they report that the binding
affinity of anti-ICAM-1 coated NC to EC could be two orders of magnitude higher than that
of anti-ICAM-1 binding to ICAM-1. Haun and Hammer [4] have investigated the kinetic
rate constants of attachment and detachment of 210 nm NCs as a function of receptor
density, ligand density on surface, and flow shear rate, and identified a time dependence of
the detachment rate due to multivalent binding. Ho et al.  [5] studied the effect of antibody
surface coverage on equilibrium binding constants by measuring fractional coverage of
bound NCs (80 nm in diameter) as a function of NC concentrations; by fitting their
experimental data, they observed linear dependence of Ka on antibody surface coverage,
leading them to conclude that the system was dominated by monovalent interactions.
Despite such previous studies on NC binding, a comprehensive understanding of the
determinants of NC binding to EC is still limited.
From a modeling perspective, numerical estimation of the binding affinities (or the absolute
free energy of binding) is a significant challenge. First, the characterization of the
underlying parameters of the model from independent experiments is non-trivial due to the
complexity of the system; some parameters are even unavailable in the literature, therefore
calling for their de-novo estimation using molecular dynamics simulations. Secondly, the
calculation of binding affinities necessarily involves the determination of absolute binding
free energies, which requires extensive sampling over conformational degrees of freedom as
well as the determination of various (translational and rotational) entropy changes upon
binding. Recently, inspired by the framework of Woo and Roux [6] on calculation binding
affinity between a flexible ligand and a receptor, we have developed a mesoscale model to
compute the absolute binding free energy of binding of NC to EC. The mesoscale model
pertains to spherical NC functionalized with antibodies and binding to antigens on EC
surface amidst fluid flow and glycocalyx (see Fig. 1). We discuss in the following sections,
how the physical and geometrical parameters for the mesoscale model and interactions are
derived from the independent experiments; this includes the properties of the flow, NC size
and shape, antibody surface coverage on NC, glycocalyx resistance, and antigen-antibody
interaction. In order to estimate de novo the only parameter unavailable in the literature,
namely the flexural rigidity of the antigen, we perform detailed molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and fluctuation analysis. Then, using the parameters derived from experiments
and MD in our mesoscale model, we compute the binding affinities of NC to EC (describedLiu et al. Page 2
Curr Nanosci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptbelow) and compare the model predictions with experimental data. Using this model, we
have investigated the effects from various tunable and design parameters under
physiological conditions and compared model predictions quantitatively with corresponding
experimental measurements. In all cases investigated, the quantitative model predictions
agreed remarkably well with experiments, which provide a comprehensive validation of our
approach. In closing, we describe some new experiments are designed based on our model
predictions as well as promising avenues for extending the model as a promising numerical
tool for optimal design of functionalized NCs in targeted drug delivery.
2. MODELING METHODS
2.1. Mesoscale Model Implementation
As shown in Fig. 1, we model the NC as a rigid sphere with uniformly distributed antibodies
on its surface. The interactions between NC and cell surface are mimicked by the
interactions between antibodies and antigens (ICAM-1s) on a flat surface. The interactions
are considered through the Bell model [7], i.e., through the reaction free energy: ΔGr (d) =
ΔG0 + 0.5 kd2, where d represents the distance between the reaction sites of the interacting
antibody and antigen, ΔG0 is the free energy change at equilibrium state ( d = 0) and k is the
interaction bond force constant.
We also account for the antigens' flexure by allowing them to bend and rotate in θ and ϕ
space (see Fig. 1). Under the assumption of small flexural deformations, we model the
flexure of an antigen as bending a beam from equilibrium (upright) position, thus the
bending energy due to flexure can be calculated as (see Ref. [8] for details):
(1)
where EI is the flexural rigidity of antigens, L represents the antigen length and yL is the
distance of the antigen tip from its equilibrium upright position. For small deformations, yL
≈ Lθ, therefore the bending energy can be expressed as:
(2)
Clearly the antigen flexural movement is highly orientation dependent. Hence, a
configurational-biased sampling technique [9] is implemented in our model to improve the
efficiency of sampling of the configurations of flexural movement. This sampling procedure
obeys detailed balance and can be described in five steps as:
(i) We first randomly select one antibody and one antigen, which are close enough
to form a bond.
(ii) Then we randomly generate 100 trial orientations { t1,t2,…, t100}, in which ti =
(θi, ϕi,bi), θi = acos ( ri) is a random angle between 0 and π/2 and ri is a
uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1, ϕi is a random angle
uniformly distributed between 0 and 2 π, bi is a random integer between 0 (break
a bond) and 1 (form a bond). For each trial ti, we calculate the bond energy Uor
(ti) = bi (ΔGr (di) + ΔGf (θi)).
(iii) The Rosenbluth factor[9] is then calculated as:Liu et al. Page 3
Curr Nanosci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript(3)
and then we select one trial tn out of the 100 trialstrials with probability
.
(iv) We then calculate the old bond energy or Uor (to) and generate another 99 trial
orientations, based on which we determine:
(4)
(v)
Finally we accept the selection of tn with the probability of min 
To include the effect of flow, a simple one-dimensional shear flow with shear rate of S is
introduced as shown in Fig. 1. We also account for the glycocalyx, which usually exists in in
vivo environments, by adding a layer of height h above the cell surface (see Fig. 1). The
flow inside the glycocalyx layer is obtained by solving the Brinkman's equation without any
pressure gradient, i.e.,
(5)
in which the glycocalyx is modeled as a porous medium and Kp is its Darcy permeability.
Following the procedures in Ref. [10], Kp is determined by solving two-dimensional Stokes
flow past an array of cylindrical fibers. The approximate expression is
(6)
where the fiber volume fraction 
 , the fiber radius rf = 6 nm and fiber
gap Δ = 8 nm. By solving the Brinkman equation with the resulting value of Kp we found
that the flow inside the glycocalyx layer is very small, which is consistent with the
observations of in vivo  experiments [11, 12]. Therefore, as indicated in Fig. 1, we neglect
the flow inside the glycocalyx ( u = 0 at z ≤ h). The flow induced drag Fx and torque Ty are
calculated by solving the steady-state Stokes equation for the shear flow past a sphere near a
surface:
(7)
with the no-slip boundary conditions and inlet flow condition of u = S (z – h, where μ is the
dynamic viscosity of the fluid and S is the shear rate. In our simulations, we set μ = 0.001Liu et al. Page 4
Curr Nanosci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptkgm−1s−1 (dynamic viscosity of water). The Stokes equations are solved using the
commercial software COMSOL and the flow induced drag Fx and torque Ty at discrete
vertical points are computed through integration of the force and torque on NC surface. The
calculated drag and torque are consistent with theoretical data from Goldmann et al.  [13]
when the sphere is close to the surface.
When the NC approaches to the cell surface, the binding is significantly impacted by the
presence of the glycocalyx layer, especially in in vivo  conditions. The glycocalyx layer
usually extends hundreds of nanometers above the cell surface as described in many
different experiments [12]. To account for the normal resistance of the glycocalyx, we add a
harmonic potential 1/ 2 kglyxH2 per unit differential area, where H is the penetration depth of
the NC into glycocalyx as indicated in Fig. 1 and kglyx is the glycocalyx stiffness. Based on
different models, the kglyx can be assumed constant or linearly increasing with H and the
values are extracted by fitting NC binding data with and without glycocalyx obtained in in
vivo experiments [14].
Regular Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) steps are employed for: (i) bond formation/breaking,
(ii) NC translation and rotation, and (iii) and antigen translation. Move (i) is selected
randomly with a probability of 50%, and in the remaining 50%, the NC translation, rotation,
and antigen translation are selected randomly with probability of 0.5 Nab/Nt, 0.5Nab/Nt and
(Nt – Nab)/Nt respectively; Nt is the combined total number of antibodies ( Nab) and antigen
molecules. The simulations are run in parallel on four processors with different realizations
of the same physical system. An adaptive step size for NC translation/rotation and antigen
diffusion is implemented to ensure a Metropolis acceptance rate of 50%.
2.2. Calculation of the Absolute Binding Free Energy
Generally for binding of ligands ( L) (or NC) to receptors ( R) the binding process can be
described as: L+R↔LR, where LR is the ligand and receptor in binding state. At
thermodynamic equilibrium, the binding affinity (or association constant) Ka is defined as:
(8)
Here [ L], [R] and [ LR] as the fraction of receptors with no ligand and one ligand bound
respectively, so that [ R] and [ LR] can be expressed as [ R] = p0 [Rtot and [ L] = [R]tot, where
[Rtot is the total receptor concentration in the whole system. We relate the fraction in Eq. (8)
to the ratio of the integral of configurational degrees of freedoms in the bound state to the
unbound state [6]:
(9)
where Ubound  and Uunbound  are the total potential energies of the system at bound and
unbound states, β = 1/kBT in which kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute
temperature. 1 represents all the degrees of freedom associated with the ligand (NC) and X
is the degrees of freedom for the remaining molecules (receptors). On a per ligand basis, the
ligand concentration is [ L] = 1/ Vunbound , where the denominator is the volume accessible to
an unbound ligand. The integral associated with the unbound state ( Uunbound  = 0) in Eq. (9)
is determined over translational degrees of freedom (yielding the volume Vunbound ), and
rotational degrees of freedom (yielding a factor of 8 π2 in 3-dimensions).Liu et al. Page 5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe final form of the binding affinity for interactions between NC and cell surface can be
expressed as (see Refs. [15, 16] for detailed derivations):
(10)
where T1 represents the entropy loss from the bounded receptors and it can be calculated as:
(11)
Here 
  is the accessible surface area to the nth receptor in the bound state and 
  is the
area in the unbound state. Term T2 accounts for the NC rotational entropy loss due to
binding:
(12)
where Nab is the number of antibodies per NC, Nb is the total number of bonds in
equilibrium state, Δω is the rotational volume of the NC in the bound state which can be
determined from the distributions of Euler angles as described in Ref. [17]. The term T3
accounts for NC translational entropy loss,
(13)
where ANCb, is the area for the NC translational movement in the bound state, ANC,ub  and
ANCubz lz are the area and volume accessible to the NC in the unbound state, and W (z) is the
potential of mean force (PMF).
To calculate the PMF W (z), we choose a reaction coordinate z along which we perform
umbrella sampling with harmonic biasing potentials. The umbrella sampling is performed
with window size of Δz = 0.05 nm and the harmonic biasing potential in each window is
chosen to be 0.5 ku (z – z0,i)2, where 0 ku (Δz)2 = 1.0×10−20 J, ku is the harmonic force
constant and z0,i is the location of the center of window i. The NC is slowly moved to the
cell surface by updating z0,i. A total of 200 million Monte Carlo steps are performed in each
window and the histogram is stored only when there exists at least one bond. All the relevant
parameters including the window size Δz, strength of the biasing potential ku and the
sampling size in each window have been tested to ensure convergence. The WHAM
algorithm [18] is used to unbias and combine the histograms in different windows to form a
complete PMF ( W(z) ) profile using a tolerance factor of 10−6. PMF profiles for each system
are averaged over four independent realizations.
2.3. Parameter Estimation
The simulation parameters are chosen to make direct contact with the experimental system
in Ref. [3], the receptor (antigen) parameters are chosen to mimic ICAM-1. The ligand
(antibody) parameters are chosen to mimic the murine anti-ICAM-1 antibody which binds
specifically to ICAM-1. For the interactions between antibody and ICAM-1, Muro et al.  [3]Liu et al. Page 6
Curr Nanosci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptreported the equilibrium free energy change between antibody and ICAM-1 to be
−7.98×10− J at 4° C, which we set as ΔG0 in the Bell model of our simulations. We obtain
the bond spring constant k = 1000 dyn/cm by fitting rupture force distribution data reported
from single-molecule force spectroscopy [8, 19]. Both ΔG0 and k are assumed to be
temperature independent based on which we derive the value of the reactive compliance γ
(distance along the reaction coordinate to reach the transition state or point of rupture) to be
~0.4 nm, which agrees very well with experimental evaluations [19, 20]. The saturation
antibody coverage has been experimentally determined [3] to be 220 per NC with a diameter
of 100 nm. The ICAM-1 surface density on endothelial cell is set at 2000
ICAM-1molecules/ μm2 to be consistent with experimental report [3] of the available
binding sites per endothelial cell. In the cases including the presence of glycocalyx, we
follow the procedures outlined our earlier study [8] in which we assume a glycocalyx height
of 100 nm. The glycocalyx stiffness is estimated as kglyx =3.4×109 J/m4 to be consistent with
the experimental observation [14] of a 500-fold decrease in binding for 100 nm NCs in the
presence of glycocalyx compared to when it is absent. Finally, we also account for the
flexure of ICAM-1 (see Fig. 1); since the exact flexural rigidity EI for ICAM-1 proteins is
unavailable in the literature, we estimate this value de novo  by performing MD simulations
and fluctuation analysis, which is described in the following section. A summary of model
parameters is provided in Table 1.
2.4. Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Fluctuation Analysis for Flexure
Flexural rigidity (flexure) describes the receptor's resistance to bending forces, and therefore
impacts both the conformational sampling of the flexible receptor as well as the binding free
energy between ICAM-1 and antibody. The flexure of ICAM-1 has not been directly
measured by experiment, so we turn to molecular dynamics simulation to provide a
microscopic description of its fluctuations. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) is
the preferred method for studying these fluctuations because it provides efficient means for
conformational sampling and direct estimation of physical properties. We have employed
MARTINI, a coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics force field developed by Marrink
and coworkers [24, 25] to access time and length scales which would be prohibitively costly
with all-atom MD. MARTINI was parameterized in a “top-down” manner designed to semi-
quantitatively reproduce the structural and thermodynamic properties of lipid and alkane test
systems. It has also been recently extended to include proteins [26], carbohydrates [27] and
polarizable water [28]. The CG methodology used in MARTINI retains relevant degrees of
freedom with a minimal set of tunable parameters and common chemical building blocks.
This provides orders-of-magnitude improvements in computational efficiency without the
need to re-parameterize the model for novel systems.
In MARTINI, groups of four heavy atoms are mapped to one interaction site or “bead” with
a standardized mass of four water molecules and an effective size of 0.47 nm. Ring-like
structures have a finer mapping that retains their natural geometry. There are four types of
beads: polar, apolar, nonpolar, and charged. These are further divided into classes based on
hydrogen bonding propensity. Van der Waals interactions are modeled by a Lennard-Jones
(LJ) potential. Differential LJ interactions between bead types produce the necessary
attractive and repulsive forces between phases; this partitioning behavior is the key point of
contact with experiments. The LJ potential is shifted to zero from 0.9 nm to the cutoff
distance of 1.2 nm. Additionally, charged beads interact according to the Coulombic
potential. Bonded interactions include a weak harmonic spring between neighbors and a
harmonic angle potential between next-nearest neighbors. Neighbors are bonded by a weak
harmonic spring without LJ interactions, while next-nearest neighbors interact with a
harmonic angle potential. Bonded parameters for amino acids are derived from bond, angle,
and dihedral distributions surveyed in the Protein Data Bank. Using the same bead types asLiu et al. Page 7
Curr Nanosci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptthe lipid model, non-bonded parameters were tuned to match the partitioning free energy of
amino acid analogs between water and oil phases as well as a host of all-atom model results.
MARTINI has been used to study several different protein systems, including the self-
assembly of G Protein-coupled receptors on a bilayer [29], the lateral diffusion of peptides
in membranes [30] and membrane poration by peptides [31, 32]. Moreover, the CG
methodology plays an important role in multiscale simulation methods [33]. Given
MARTINI's ability to semi-quantitatively describe the properties of larger biomolecular
systems, it is the method of choice for estimating ICAM-1 flexure.
Simulations were performed in GROMACS 4.5.3 [34] using the standard simulation
parameters outlined above and described in detail by Monticelli et al. [26]. A homology
model of ICAM-1 (450 residues) was constructed from PDB structures of both the D1–D2
[35] and D3–D5 domains of ICAM-1 reported by Yang et al.  [36]. Given that the
physiological dimerization state is unknown or at best ambiguous [37] we have simulated
the monomer as well as dimer systems. Harmonic restraints replaced the missing dimer
interface loops in the dimer simulation, but this loop was explicitly modeled (using
MODELLER [38]) for the monomer simulation.
Each model was solvated in a water box with periodic boundary conditions and at least 4 nm
between the protein and the box edge (200,000 water beads for the dimer and 50,000 for the
monomer). Counter-ions were added to create a physiological concentration of 0.150 nM.
To mimic attachment to a membrane, the C-terminal amino acids were position-restrained.
All simulations were conducted in position-restrained NVT, followed by unrestrained NPT
ensembles using the standard (maximum) MARTINI time step of 40 fs and the Berendsen
thermostat with a pressure of 1 atm, a time constant of 1 ps, and a compressibility of
4.5×10−5 bar−1. The neighbor list was cut off at 1.2 nm and the LINCS algorithm was used
to constrain bond angles. Simulations were run for 100 ns after an initial 10 ns equilibration
period. As per recommendations by Monticelli et al.  [26], an elastic network model (ENM)
with a force constant of 500 kJ/molnm was applied to all CG beads within 0.5–0.9 nm to
support/stabilize higher-order protein structure.
In order to extract flexural rigidity from CGMD simulations, we model ICAM-1 as an
elastic rod represented by a parametric curve with tangent angle θ(s), where s is the contour
length. For an elastic rod with small fluctuations, flexure is given by Hooke's law, such that
the total bending energy is given by:
(14)
We remove any contributions to the bending energy by the mean curvature of the elastic rod,
θ0 (s), to allow for bent native conformations. According to the analysis by Gittes et al.  [39],
we decompose the rod shape into Fourier modes (with coefficients an and 
 ) and rewrite the
bending energy term as Eq. (15):
(15)
The equipartition theorem states that each mode contributes kT/2 to the energy, where k is
the Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature; therefore we can calculate EI from the
variance of each Fourier mode according to Eq. (16):Liu et al. Page 8
Curr Nanosci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript(16)
Eq. (17) relates flexure to the persistence length, the distance at which tangent-tangent
angles become uncorrelated. Both the flexure and persistence length describe the same
property: the receptor's resistance to bending.
(17)
These definitions are valid as long as the protein is elastic and experiences only thermally-
driven fluctuations which are small relative to the mean curvature.
ICAM-1 is composed of five ordered protein domains denoted D1–D5, which suggest a
simple discretization in which six key residues that bookend these domains can provide a
useful approximation of its contours. We selected the most intuitive candidates: 26N, 83Y,
185F, 281Y, 366L, and 450P. This yielded the best approximation of the receptor shape. We
calculated flexure via Fourier mode analysis and the tangent correlation method. For the
latter, the contour lengths were defined from a single reference point at the C-terminal
residue to the midpoint between residues forming the bending angle.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Calculation of Flexure from CGMD
Fig. 2 depicts the CG monomer and dimer structures with elastic network bonds. Flexure
estimates are summarized in Table 2. We used both the Fourier mode analysis from Eq. (15)
and tangent-tangent correlation methods from Eq. (17) to estimate flexure from 100 ns
segments of ICAM-1 monomer and dimer CGMD trajectories. Not surprisingly, the dimer is
more rigid than the monomer, owing to the harmonic restraints used to mimic poorly-
resolved dimer interface loops; in particular, we estimate a monomer flexure of 800 pN•nm2
and dimer flexure of 20,000 pN•nm2. In addition to the systems described here, we tested
the sensitivity of these results by simulating similar systems with additional restraints,
different ENM parameters, and different loop-modeling methods.
There is up to 10-fold disagreement between flexure calculated via the tangent correlation
method and the first mode of Fourier decomposition. We can attribute this to the
approximations inherent to both the calculation method and the ICAM-1 model itself. In the
tangent correlation calculation, the errors are relatively large, indicating large variation in
Δθ(s) = [θ(s) −θ0 (s)], and the receptor was discretized by only five angles. The Fourier
mode analysis does not have this limitation, and each mode should provide an independent
estimate of flexure. However, due to the limited resolution and sampling of our discretized
curves, only the lowest modes are reliable.
Our model could be improved by using a fitted, heterogeneous elastic network model which
has been parameterized to match finer, all-atom MD simulation as per methods developed
by Lyman et al.  [41] Since the dimerized structure was used as a template for both the
monomer and dimer starting structures, it is also likely that our model does not accurately
capture the true conformation of the monomeric form. The equilibrium between monomer
and dimer has also not been resolved by our model. Despite these approximations, our
CGMD calculations provide a useful de novo  estimation of the flexural rigidity andLiu et al. Page 9

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptpersistence length. To place our calculation in the biological context, we compare the
computed value of persistence length for ICAM-1 (current study) to those for common rod-
like biomolecules estimated from experiments and simulations, see Table 3.
3.2. Calculation of Potential of Mean Force (PMF) of NC Binding to EC
Following Ref. [15], here we calculate the PMF profiles for NCs with diameter of 100 nm
and the number of antibody Nab=162 (which corresponds to 74% of saturation coverage).
Due to the large experimental uncertainties in flexural rigidity of ICAM-1 receptors, we
explore three values of ICAM-1 flexural rigidities at 1400, 7000 and 35000 pN•nm2, which
lie in between that of glyco-proteins (700 pN•nm2) and actin filaments (15–70×103
pN•nm2), see Table 3. These values also span range of the ICAM-1 flexural rigidities
evaluated using CGMD described in the previous section.
Fig. 4(a) shows the calculated PMF profiles with different ICAM-1 flexural rigidities at
temperature of 27 ° C, as clearly indicated, for all three cases three firm bonds form ( Nb = 3)
with a similar characteristic free energy well of around - 32 kBT in equilibrium state when
projected along the reaction coordinate z. Fig. 4(b) shows the spatially averaged distribution
of the bound ICAM-1 relative to the center of NC for the case with EI = 7000 pN•nm2, and
this is basically an annulus distribution, based on which the outer ( ro) and inner radius ( ri) is
estimated; all the area terms in Eq. (11) are directly related to r0 and ri. In particular,
AR,ub(1)=AR,ub(2) =…=A R,ub(5) =π ro2, AR,b(1)=πro2, AR,b(2)=π(ro2−ri2),
AR,b(3)=AR,b(4)=AR,b(5)=ANC,b=(ro−ri)2. As indicated in Fig. 4(d), the ICAM-1 distributions
are nearly the same for different flexural rigidities. Fig. 4(c) shows the distribution of the
flexure angle ( θ) at equilibrium state for different flexural rigidities. As expected, the
average flexure angle increases with decreasing EI. Based on the PMF profile in Fig. 4(a),
the NC translational entropy loss (Eq. (13)) is calculated and as stated above the rotational
entropy loss can be evaluated based on the Euler angle distributions. Finally the binding
affinities ( Ka) and the dissociation constants ( Kd=1/Ka) is determined and listed in Fig. 4(d).
There is a slight increase in binding with smaller EI; but the effect is small and within the
statistical errorbars. In a similar fashion [16], the binding affinity between single antibody
and ICAM-1 is also be calculated and as listed in Table 4, both the interactions of NC-cell
surface (for 100 nm NCs) and antibody-ICAM-1 and found consistent with corresponding
experimental measurements under similar conditions.
3.3. Effects of Glycocalyx and Flow
In Ref. [16], we investigated the effects of glycocalyx and shear flow (hydrodynamics) on
binding between NC and cell surface. The numerical implementations are described in
section 2.1. The PMF profiles for different values of the glycocalyx thickness were
computed, based on which the binding affinities were also calculated. Then we reported the
ratio of the binding affinity without glycocalyx to that with glycocalyx as a function of
glycocalyx thickness. The results indicated an exponential dependence. In other words,
glycocalyx with thickness of 55~70 nm only reduces the binding by about 2 fold although
that with a thickness of 100 nm can actually reduce the binding by a factor of 500. This
exponential dependence was confirmed in our simulations with different particle sizes (100
nm vs. 200 nm particles) and different glycocalyx models (constant kglyx vs. linear
increasing kglyx), and helps to rationalize the large differences between in vitro  [47] and in
vivo [14] experimental results of glycocalyx-mediated NC binding.
In Ref. [16], the effect of flow was also discussed by introducing a 1-dimensional shear flow
with a shear rate S (see Fig. 1). From the PMF profiles at different shear rates, it was found
that the free energy first decreases below a threshold S then increases. As a result, the
corresponding dissociation constant ( Kd) shows a biphasic trend with shear rate, in otherLiu et al. Page 10
Curr Nanosci . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 October 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptwords, below a threshold shear rate the flow actually enhances NC binding by reducing Kd,
while above the threshold the flow reduces the binding by promoting NC detachment.
Consistent with experimental measurements of particle rolling [48], we have shown that this
behavior was insensitive to the particle size. Through inspection of the numerical details, we
found the multivalent interactions were the key to this shear enhanced NC binding
phenomenon, which has been extensively studied experimentally due to its important
implications in many disease related processes [49]. In summary, we have shown that the
shear enhanced binding arises solely due to multivalent interactions. This effect is hence
distinct from the so-called “catch” bonds which are thought to be based on a two-state
conformational change in the receptors caused by shear, see Whitfield et al.  [50].
We note that in considering the binding of 100 nm NC under in vivo conditions, our model
in the presence of glycocalyx (Equation 7) predicts that the flow is practically zero. In this
situation, the flow does not have any effect on the binding of 100 nm NCs which are fully
immersed within the glycocalyx layer. Hence, the PMF in the presence of glycocalyx can be
recovered from PMF in the absence of the glycocayx through an analytical correction:
W(z) glyx,h =W(z) glyx,h=0  + ∫ 1/2k glyxH2dA, where H=z −h.
3.4. Comparison with Experiments
In Table 3, we compared the dissociation constants ( Kd) computed from our model with in
vitro  measurements [3] under similar conditions for both interactions of NC-cell and single
antibody-ICAM-1. Both interactions agree within reasonable uncertainties. We then studied
the effect of the antibody surface coverage ( σs) on NC [15], and interestingly we observed a
threshold at about 45% coverage, below which the NC binding precipitously dropped below
that of single antibody-ICAM-1 interactions. Intriguingly, this threshold was almost exactly
reproduced in in vivo  measurements of the endothelial targeting of NCs in the lung of mice
at different antibody coverages; detailed description of the comparison can be found in Ref.
[15]. The individual PMF profiles at different σs revealed an integer reduction in the
multivalency (from three to two) at the threshold, and as a consequence, the binding free
energy reduced by about 6 kBT. The significance of this result is that for 100 nm NCs, there
is an optimal antibody coverage (at ~45%), above which the NCs can effectively bind to
endothelial cells. We further demonstrated the accuracy of our model by comparing our
model predictions with AFM force measurements. The AFM rupture force measurements of
NC unbinding yielded a mean rupture force of 316 pN over 89 trials. We predict a mean
rupture force of ~215–230 pN derived from our computed PMF profiles, which is again in
close agreement with experiments (see Ref. [15] for details). Furthermore, our most recent
reports of the effects of particle size, glycocalyx and shear flow [16], have all yielded model
predictions in close agreement with experimental observations [47, 48, 51].
4. FUTURE OUTLOOK
In conclusion, using a general multiscale framework, a powerful mesoscale model has been
developed to study the targeting of functionalized NCs to cell surfaces. The model and the
simulation methodology uniquely yield the absolute binding free energy of binding between
NC and cell surface and has been rigorously validated through comparison with broad and
independent experiments, namely, in vitro , AFM, and in vivo  endothelial targeting in mice;
the three-level agreement between modeling results and experimental measurements
establishes the thermodynamic, mechanical and physiological consistency of the model,
which we believe can now be employed for predictive simulations or as a guide for future
experiments. The coarse-grained MD simulations, while subject to the well appreciated
limitations provides crucial constraints on the allowable parameter values of flexural
rigidity, thereby providing important structural insight as well as molecular input to the
mesoscale model. Scenarios we envision for the near future include the effect of ICAM-1Liu et al. Page 11

incorporation of membrane microenvironment and mechanics [52–56]), we believe that our

Abstract
The limited size of the germline antibody repertoire has to recognize a far larger number of
potential antigens. The ability of a single antibody to bind multiple ligands due to conformational
flexibility in the antigen-binding site can significantly enlarge the repertoire. Among the six
hyper-variable complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that comprise the binding site, the
CDR H3 loop is particularly flexible. Computational protein design studies showed that predicted
low energy sequences compatible with a given backbone structure often have considerable
similarity to the corresponding native sequences of naturally occurring proteins, indicating that
native protein sequences are close to optimal for their structures. Here, we take a step forward to
determine whether conformational flexibility, believed to play a key functional role in germline
antibodies, is also central in shaping their native sequence. In particular, we use a multi-constraint
computational design strategy, along with the Rosetta energy function, to propose that the native
sequences of CDR H3 loops from germline antibodies are nearly optimal for conformational
flexibility. Moreover, we find that antibody maturation may lead to sequences with a higher
degree of optimization for a single conformation, while disfavoring sequences that are intrinsically
flexible. In addition, this computational strategy allows us to predict mutations in the CDR H3
loop to stabilize the antigen-bound conformation, a computational mimic of affinity maturation,
that may increase antigen binding affinity by pre-organizing the antigen binding loop. In vivo
affinity maturation data are consistent with our predictions. The method described here can be
useful to design antibodies with higher selectivity and affinity by reducing conformational
diversity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptcontributing three loops, called H1, H2, H3 and L1, L2, L3, respectively1,2. The broad range
of binding specificities exhibited by antibodies is the result of the diversity in sequence,
length and conformational flexibility of the CDRs3–6. The limited size of the germline
antibody repertoire has to recognize a far larger number of potential antigens. Even though
gene rearrangements broaden the spectrum of binding specificities, additional mechanisms
for increasing antibody cross-reactivity have been hypothesized to overcome the limits
imposed by the available B cell receptors7–11. In particular, structural and biochemical
studies have shown that germline antibodies often possess flexible binding sites, which
frequently undergo loop conformational changes and side-chain rearrangements upon
antigen binding, with the most prominent changes occurring in the CDR H3 loop12–18.
Conformational flexibility, defined as the ability to adopt multiple conformations, of
germline antibodies could thus provide alternative ways of presenting the binding site to
accommodate structurally unrelated ligands19. This flexibility-derived multi-specificity
might be achieved at the expense of a relative weak strength of binding12,13. Antibody
maturation could then act by increasing the affinity of an antigen-antibody complex, often
by reducing flexibility and stabilizing the antibody binding site in a conformation pre-
organized for the interaction with the targeted antigen12,13,15–17,20. This decrease in
conformational flexibility might in turn reduce any potential cross-reactivity that resulted
from conformational diversity19,21.
Computational protein design methods have progressed considerably22–26, advancing our
understanding of the relationship between protein sequence and three-dimensional structure.
Recently, a computational design method was used to increase antibody-antigen binding
affinity mainly through modulation of electrostatic interactions27. Moreover, a variety of
methods for designing protein variants with altered conformational flexibility have been
implemented with considerable success. These approaches consider simultaneously several
protein conformers during the design simulation (multi-constraint design28) and explicitly
stabilize one conformation over alternative input conformers29,30, or all input conformations
simultaneously31. In the latter case, the output sequences generated by the design simulation
are likely to represent a compromise between the different preferences of all conformers
considered.
It has been shown that low energy designed protein sequences for a given protein backbone
structure often have considerable similarity to the corresponding native sequences of
naturally occurring proteins, suggesting that native protein sequences are close to optimal
for their structures32–38. This prompted us to hypothesize that, if conformational flexibility
is an intrinsic property of the germline antigen-binding site, then antibody native sequences,
particularly those of the CDR H3 loops, should show a compromise between the sequence
preferences of alternative conformations adopted by the loop. Here, we use a multi-
constraint computational design strategy39, based on the Rosetta design algorithm35 and
scoring function24,40,41, to suggest that the native sequences of CDR H3 loops in germline
antibodies known to adopt several conformations are close to optimal for conformational
flexibility. While the computational design of surface-exposed and loop regions is
challenging, the Rosetta algorithm has been applied successfully to engineer a protein loop
in good agreement with the crystal structure of the designed protein42, indicating that,
although still difficult, high-resolution design of protein loops is becoming possible. By
generating sequence profiles from the design simulations, we predict mutations in CDR H3
loops to preferentially stabilize the bound conformation, and show that our predictions agree
with existing experimental data on antibody affinity maturation. The strategy used in this
study can serve to design antibodies with increased specificity and affinity by reducing
antibody conformational diversity.Babor and Kortemme Page 2

Creation of a dataset of pairs of free and antigen-bound antibody structures with CDR H3
loops adopting alternative conformations
We used a combined approach that included an exhaustive search of the Protein Data
Bank43 as well as a literature search to identify all pairs of germline antibody X-ray
structures that have been crystallized in both the bound and free conformations. The final set
of germline antibodies is shown in Table I, rows 1 to 6. The sequence and length of the CDR
loops was determined using the SACS database44. The Cα RMSD for each of the CDR
loops was calculated by local superimposition of the bound and free forms of each of the
CDR loops independently (C α loop atoms were used for the superimposition and RMSD
calculations). Among all six CDR loops, only CDR H3 loop showed considerable
differences (at least 0.6 Å C α RMSD) between the bound and free forms for all germline
antibodies in our dataset (Table SI). Similarly, we then identified all mature antibodies
crystallized in both the antigen-bound and free forms that differ in their CDR H3 loop
conformations. We ensured that germline and mature antibody sets had comparable
characteristics, by enforcing in all cases the following criteria: (i) CDR H3 loop C α RMSD
≥ 0.6 Å between bound and free conformations, and (ii) CDR H3 loop length ranging from 5
to 12 amino acid residues. Note that all Fv antibody bound-free pairs share 100% sequence
identity, except antibody 50.1, in which one position differs (residue 5 in the H chain is Lys
in the bound form, but Gln in the free form)45,46; this mutation is not in contact with the
CDR H3 loop or its surrounding shell47. In cases in which the same antibody was
crystallized bound to different molecules, the structure containing the molecule against
which the antibody was raised was chosen (e.g. structure 1n7m for 7g12, 1q9q for s25-2, or
1oau for spe7). This choice was important for mature antibodies and when variants of an
antibody with varying degrees of affinity maturation were compared (see next paragraph).
When several structures of the same antibody form were available, the one with the highest
resolution was selected (Table I).
Creation of a dataset of X-ray structures of pairs of antibodies differing only in their
degree of maturation
We created a dataset of X-ray structures of pairs of antibodies that differ only in their degree
of maturation, using the same methodology described above. To minimize structural
differences within pairs that could arise from the absence or presence of different binding
partners, we looked for structures crystallized in the same form (e.g. both in the free form or,
in the case of antigen-bound forms, both bound to the same epitope). The final dataset is
composed of the following pairs of structures (the resolution in Angstroms is shown in
brackets and the germline antibody (or the antibody isolated after a “short period” of
exposure to the antigen) is listed first for each pair): 1n7m(1.0)-1ngw(2.6),
1fl6(2.8)-1kel(1.9), 1dv6(2.0)-1axs(2.6), 1aj7(2.1)-1gaf(2.0), 1q9q(1.5)-1q9w(1.8),
1mlc(2.5)-1p2c(2.0), 1ndm(2.1)-1ndg(1.9), 1ngz(1.8)-1ngy(2.2), 1fl5(2.1)-1kem(2.2),
1d5i(2.0)-1d5b(2.8), 2a6j(2.7)-1jfq(1.9), 2rcs(2.1)-1hkl(2.7), 1q9k(2.0)-1q9o(1.8),
1mlb(2.1)-2q76(2.0). Pairs 1 to 7 correspond to bound states and pairs 8 to 14 to free states.
Antibody CDR H3 loop design
Before starting the design protocol, PDB structures were prepared as in39. Briefly, all
antigens, hetero-atoms (including water molecules), and hydrogen atoms present in the
original PDB file were excluded. Then, hydrogen atoms were added using the procedure
described in41. Finally, side-chain torsion angle minimization was performed using the
Rosetta scoring function (cysteine side chains were kept fixed to avoid interfering with
native disulfide bonds).Babor and Kortemme Page 3
Proteins . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe Rosetta design method, described in35, and full-atom scoring function24,40,41 was used
in all simulations and implemented as in39. Briefly, the Rosetta design score is dominated by
a Lennard-Jones potential, an explicit hydrogen-bonding term41, and an implicit solvation
model48; the total score results from a trade off among the different terms present in the
scoring function. Side chains from a rotamer library (including the native amino acid residue
PDB conformation), and with additional rotamers around the chi 1 and chi 2 angles, were
sampled on a fixed backbone using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing optimization
protocol24. Sequences were optimized for a single structure or for a set of input structures by
using single- and multi-constraint protocols, respectively. Single-constraint simulations
serve to identify lowest score sequences for each of the target conformations separately,
whereas multi-constraint simulations serve to identify lowest score sequences compatible
with multiple target conformations. Similar to the method described in39, for multi-
constraint simulations the score was a sum of the scores of a given amino acid sequence
calculated for both conformations. Simulations designed all positions of the CDR H3 loop.
Residues for which, based on the native sequence and structure, at least one side chain heavy
atom was located within 4 Å of a heavy atom of any residue in the H3 loop were chosen for
design were repacked (allowed to change rotamer conformation while keeping the amino
acid residue type fixed). Native cysteine residues were excluded from designing or
repacking. Each single- or multi-constraint optimization allowed all amino acid residues
(except cysteine) to be substituted at each position selected for design. All simulations used
a genetic algorithm to generate and propagate putative sequences. An initial random
population of 2000 sequences was allowed to propagate for 70–150 generations. Lowest
scoring sequences were taken after the score in sequence simulations using the genetic
algorithm remained approximately constant over several generations (not more than 0.7
Rosetta units difference in score; on average, convergence defined by this criterion was
observed after 50–100 generations). For a more detailed description of the method refer to39.
It should be noted that both search methods applied here, Monte Carlo simulated annealing
for rotamer optimization and the genetic algorithm for sequence optimization, do not
guarantee to find the globally optimal solution. Therefore, we compared the genetic
algorithm design predictions to exhaustive sequence enumerations for the single- and multi-
constraint design simulations for the germline antibody 7g12 (where design on 5 loop
positions yielded a tractable number of 19^5 total possible sequences per simulation). The
designed output low-energy sequences obtained using the Rosetta genetic algorithm ranked
1st (for free and multi-constraint design) and 4th (for single-constraint design on the bound
conformation) among all designed sequences from the exhaustive search. In the latter case,
the score was within 0.5 Rosetta units (approximating kcal/mol) of that of the global
minimum design, and the sequences only differed in one position (WWHMF and
WWHMW). Thus, we expect the results obtained using the genetic algorithm to be close to
the global minimum (although these results do not exclude the possibility that search
problems are more severe for longer designed sequences).
Generation of sequence profiles
Lower Rosetta scores correspond to predicted increase in stability; therefore, for each
simulation the most stable designed sequences had lower negative values than the native
sequence (all cases showed values smaller than zero). Profiles were created by including all
designed sequences that scored lower than a “delta” value from the lowest score obtained in
the simulation. The value of delta was dependent on the extent of the optimization and
defined as follow: (native score – lowest score) *0.25 and denoted “lowest scoring 25%”.
This criterion was used consistently for all antibodies and simulations (single- and multi-
constraint). Varying the delta value resulted in qualitatively similar profiles.Babor and Kortemme Page 4

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptBinomial test
We determined the statistical significance of the observed differences in native sequence
recovery between multi- and single-constraint methods using the Binomial test49. We
considered that each position had two options: recover or not recover the native amino acid
residue, and, as an approximation, that native sequence recovery in one position was
independent of the outcome at any other position. The binomial probability p 0 of recovery
was estimated by averaging the recovery observed in the three analyzed cases (multi-
constraint and single-constraint for bound and free forms). The null hypothesis assumes that,
regardless of the design protocol, the percentage of native sequence recovery is the same.
Then, we evaluated if our cases satisfy the following inequality to determine if a “large
sample test” could be performed:
where n is the number of designed positions and p 0 the probability of recovery of the native
amino acid residue type. This inequality was satisfied both by the germline and mature
antibody sets. Thus, we tested H 0:p = p 0 versus H 1 :p > p 0 ; where p is the probability of
recovery in the multi-constraint simulations, by evaluating:
Note that×is the number of positions recovered in the multi-constraint protocol. Once z was
known, we calculated the P-value and determined whether H 0 should be rejected or not. In
all cases, P-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
Rationale and computational strategy
The structural flexibility of the germline antigen-binding site, in particular of the CDR H3
loop, led us to the following hypotheses: if conformational diversity is an intrinsic property
of germline CDR H3 loops, then their native sequences may be compromises between the
sequence preferences for several conformations. It may then follow that, when flexibility is
reduced during antibody affinity maturation, the sequences of mature antibodies should
instead be closer to optimal for single conformations.
To assess whether CDR H3 loop sequences are optimal for any of the alternative
conformations they adopt or, on the contrary, are compromises between the sequences
preferred by each of the experimentally observed conformations, we used a computational
design method as implemented in the Rosetta design algorithm and all-atom scoring
function24,35,40,41. We applied a Rosetta-based multi-constraint protein design
methodology31,39 to a dataset of 28 structures of 14 pairs of germline and mature antibodies
with CDR H3 loops that adopt two alternative conformations in the bound and free forms
(Table I). Single-constraint optimization minimized the folding score for a single
conformation, while multi-constraint design aimed at searching for low energy CDR H3
loop amino acid sequences that are simultaneously consistent with both input antibody
structures (minimizing the sum of the calculated folding scores over both bound and free
conformations). Sequences optimized in this way for stability compatible with both bound
and free conformations (multi-constraint design) are then compared to the designed
sequences optimized for each conformation separately (single-constraint design), as well as
to the “native” (or wild type) sequence. In this manner, we sought to determine the degree ofBabor and Kortemme Page 5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptpredicted optimality of each native sequence with respect to its two known alternative
conformations (Fig. 1) (it should be noted that our analysis does not necessarily rely on the
assumption that conformations similar to the bound structure are populated to a significant
extent in the unbound state, see Discussion). In addition, we reasoned that this analysis
should reveal candidate positions for modulating flexibility which, when altered by
mutagenesis, could result in less flexible antibodies with higher binding affinities.
The native CDR H3 loop sequences of germline antibodies are optimized to adopt
alternative conformations
For clarity, we will first present a simple example of the computational strategy, shown in
Table II, for the CDR H3 loop of the germline 7g12 antibody17 depicted in Fig. 2. Table II
lists the native sequence, the predicted lowest scoring sequence obtained from the multi-
constraint design simulation, as well as the lowest scoring sequences obtained for each of
the single-constraint design simulations for the free and bound conformations (while the
sequence optimization methods used here are stochastic and thus do not guarantee obtaining
the global minimum23, we tested for convergence in the simulations, see Methods). In this
simple example, for three out of the five designed positions the native amino acid residue
was recovered by the multi-constraint design simulation. In contrast, native amino acid
residues were recovered at none or two native positions when the single-constraint design
strategy was applied to the bound and free structures, respectively (the antigen is omitted in
all design simulations). The designed sequence for the single constraint bound conformation
of antibody 7g12 shown in Table II had a substantially hydrophobic character. To assess our
design prediction with an alternative method, we used the ERIS server for stability
estimation50. ERIS predicts the WWHMF sequence to be about 2.8 kcal/mol more stable
than the wild-type sequence, consistent with our results. Similar hydrophobic sequence
stretches can also be present in H3 loops of naturally occurring antibodies51 (see
Supplementary Materials).
The results of the single- and multi-constraint analysis, applied to the 28 antibody structures
in our dataset (Table I), are shown in Fig. 3. In general, considering the two observed
alternative structures for each antibody simultaneously during the design simulation leads to
modeled sequences that more closely resemble the native antibody sequences. This
observation is substantially more pronounced in germline than in mature antibodies. We use
the term “native sequence recovery” to measure the fraction of all design positions at which
the native amino acid residue was present in the lowest scoring designed sequence.
Germline antibodies have a lower  native sequence recovery than mature antibodies when the
designs were performed using any of the single structures as inputs (free or bound
conformations), but a larger  recovery than mature antibodies when both conformations were
used as inputs simultaneously. In order to assess the statistical significance of these
observations, we performed a Binomial test (Table SII)49. The null hypothesis assumes that
the binomial probability of recovering the native amino acid residue for a given position is
identical for any of the three procedures applied (multi-constraint, single-constraint for the
bound structure, and single-constraint for the free structure) and, as an additional
approximation, independent of the output in other positions. In this way, we calculated the
probabilities of native sequence recovery in the multi-constraint simulation to be H 0 (null
hypothesis): p = 0.436; H 1 (test hypothesis): p > 0.436 for germline antibodies and H 0: p =
0.485; H 1: p > 0.485 for mature antibodies. The resulting P-values were 0.01 and 0.11 for
germline and mature antibodies, respectively. These results thus indicate that the multi-
constraint design protocol leads to a significantly larger native sequence recovery with
respect to the single-constraint design strategy for germline antibodies, but not for mature
antibodies. We conclude that the native CDR H3 loop sequences of germline antibodies are
compromises between the sequence preferences of at least each of the individual bound andBabor and Kortemme Page 6

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptfree conformational states analyzed. We observed similar trends when, instead of
considering only the sequence with the lowest score (the designed sequence with predicted
highest stability, according to the Rosetta scoring function), we examined the top three or
five unique sequences with the lowest scores (data not shown). This indicates that our
observations are independent of the precise number of lowest score designed sequences
analyzed.
The native sequence recovery for each individual antibody in our dataset is shown in Fig.
S1. The higher native sequence recovery obtained by the multi-constraint design strategy
applies to all germline antibodies, even though the relative recovery for different antibodies
spans a range. Conversely, for mature antibodies the sequence recovery patterns are case-
dependent, with some showing better native sequence recovery in multi-state simulations,
some in single-constraint simulations for the bound conformation, and some for the unbound
conformation (see Figures S1, S2).
The extent of sequence optimization of the CDR H3 loop is related to the degree of
exposure to the antigen (antibody maturation)
The higher degree of sequence optimization of the individual CDR H3 loop conformations
in mature antibodies is also reflected in the larger recovery observed for mature compared to
germline antibodies when the designs were performed using any of the individual structures
as input (Fig. 3). This observation prompted us to compare the extent of native sequence
recovery in CDR H3 loop positions for a set consisting of pairs of corresponding  antibodies
that differ only in their degree of exposure to the same  antigen epitope. Therefore, to
minimize structural changes that result just from the absence or presence of different binding
partners, we applied the single-constraint design strategy to the 14 pairs of corresponding
germline and mature antibody structures shown in Table III that were crystallized in the
same form (either both in the free form or both bound to the same antigen epitope; see
Methods). Using this dataset, we find that antibody maturation correlates with an increase in
the percentage of overall native sequence recovery from 35.5% (for germline antibodies or
antibodies isolated after a “short period” of exposure to the antigen) to 53.6% for more
mature forms (Fig. 4). The larger native sequence recovery observed for the more mature
antibodies is not a consequence of systematically higher crystallographic resolution of
mature antibody structures (see Methods) or presence of the antigen in the simulations,
which is omitted in all design runs. We assessed the statistical significance of the difference
in sequence recovery with a Binomial test, with the null hypothesis assuming that there is no
difference in the native sequence recovery between the germline (or “short exposure” to
antigen) antibodies and more mature forms. The resulting P-value was 0.03 (see Table SIII
for details), suggesting that longer exposures to the antigen select sequences with a higher
degree of optimization for the corresponding single conformation, likely at the expense of
sequences that are intrinsically flexible. The relative recovery within the germline and
mature antibody groups spans a range (Figure S3).
Available biochemical data for the unbound state of the mature antibody d44.1 and its more
mature form, named f.10.6.6, indicate that f.10.6.6 is more stable, both in circular dichroism
and fluorescence studies52. Longer antigen exposure of this antibody resulted in two
mutations in the CDR H3 loop: Asn102 to Phe and Gly104 to Val. Interestingly, the lowest
score sequence predicted in the single-constraint simulation by our design algorithm for the
free d44.1 antibody indicates that positions 102 and 104 could be further stabilized, as these
positions did not recover the native amino acids; instead, the simulations predicted non-
native amino acid residues as optimal (Table SIV). In particular, for position 102, the design
algorithm predicted a Phe residue to improve atomic packing between the CDR H3 loop and
the rest of the Fv domain. The atomic packing is similar to the structure of the more matureBabor and Kortemme Page 7
Proteins . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptf.10.6.6 antibody that, in fact, acquired a Phe at this position (see Fig. 5). Moreover, reduced
antibody flexibility upon antigen exposure is also consistent with available structural data
that indicate that somatic mutations often lead to a decrease in antibody conformational
entropy by pre-organizing the antigen binding site13,53,54. Structural comparisons for free
and bound forms of antibodies crystallized in different maturation stages indicate that, for a
given antibody, the conformational differences between the bound and free states of the
CDR H3 loops (as measured by C α RMSD) are larger in germline than in mature forms
(Table III). For position 104 in antibody d44.1, our method predicts Lys, even though a Gly
is the native residue and Val is found in the more mature form. This may be explained by the
sampling protocol we applied here: Structural inspection suggests that the mutation of
position 55 outside the H3 loop in the light chain from Ser in antibody d44.1 to Met in
antibody f.10.6.6 would have a steric overlap with a Lys at position 104. In our simulations,
the design is restricted to residues within the H3 loop and therefore does not consider the
effects that mutations in positions outside the H3 loop could have.
Identification of CDR H3 loop positions modulating flexibility
Our analysis of native sequence recovery indicates that germline antibodies are optimized
for conformational flexibility, which in turn suggests that mutations could stabilize the CDR
H3 loop in a particular conformation. Thus, we next sought to identify CDR H3 loop
positions important for flexibility that, if mutated, could lead to the stabilization of the CDR
H3 loop in one particular conformation. Towards this goal, we generated sequence profiles
to determine the preference at a certain designed position for a given amino acid residue
when each alternative CDR H3 loop structure is considered alone, or when both are
considered simultaneously. Specifically, instead of retrieving only the sequence with the
lowest Rosetta score from each simulation, we generated sequence profiles (for the multi-
and each single-constraint design protocol) by retrieving the lowest (best) scoring 25% of all
sequences that scored better than the native sequence (see Methods). As a simple
approximation, we assume independence of all designed positions. To facilitate analysis,
“amino acid residue classes” for each of the designed positions were defined according to
their chemical properties and size55, as follows: Aliphatic =[V,L,I], Aromatic =[F,W,H,Y],
Met=[M], Small =[S,T,A,G], Polar =[N,Q], Basic =[K,R], Acidic =[D,E], and Pro=[P].
Analysis of the designed sequence profiles enabled us to define two types of amino acid
positions in the CRD H3 loops. First, “constrained” positions, where the amino acid residue
predicted to be optimal in multi-constraint design is also optimal in single constraint design
(i.e. positions at which a residue class is favored in one or both single conformations) (see
Table SV). Second, “compromised” are those positions where residues are only predicted to
be native (or native-like) in multi-constraint design. In other words, these are positions at
which both alternative conformations would prefer another amino acid residue class, but a
compromise is chosen to accommodate both conformations simultaneously. In particular, we
are interested in cases in which further sequence optimization for the bound conformation
can be predicted. This may be the case for compromised or constrained positions in which
the multi- and single-constraint simulations for the free form share similar profiles, but
differ from the profile obtained for the single-constraint protocol applied to the bound form.
Analysis of the sequence profiles for the 52 positions in the CDR H3 loops of the germline
antibodies in our dataset indicated that 30 positions are constrained by both alternative
conformations (they share similar amino acid residue class preferences), and in 25 of the 30
cases the representative amino acid residues were native or native-like (as defined by the
similarity classes listed above). In addition, we identified eight positions constrained by a
single conformation. Five of these positions are predicted to be candidates for stabilization
of the bound conformation upon mutation (here the free conformation and the multi-
constraint optimized sequences share the same preference), while the remaining three areBabor and Kortemme Page 8
Proteins . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptcandidates for stabilization of the free conformation. In addition, we found one
“compromised” (Table SV) position predicted to be a good target for stabilization of either
the bound or free conformation. Most of the remaining thirteen positions (out of the 52
positions in our dataset) appear plastic for at least one of the conformations (they did not
show particular amino acid residue class preferences). Thus, in total our sequence profile
analysis identified nine positions (~20% of all designed positions) predicted to be relevant
for modulation of CDR H3 loop flexibility.
Particularly interesting are the six cases for which we predict that further optimization of the
bound conformation might be possible (Table IV). Heavy chain position 101 in antibody
7g12 is known to mutate during affinity maturation19. Consistent with this observation, our
analysis predicts that mutation of position 101 in 7g12 could lead to the stabilization of the
CDR H3 loop in the bound conformation (discussed in more detail below). Four of the six
positions predicted to stabilize the bound conformation, if mutated, have Ser as the native
amino acid residue. Previous studies have shown that Ser frequently mutates during the
affinity maturation process56. For all six positions shown in Table IV, the sequence profiles
obtained for the multi-constraint design and the single-constraint designs for the free form
are similar and include mostly small residues. In contrast, the sequence profile obtained for
the bound form is enriched in large hydrophobic amino acid residues. Four out of the six
positions predicted for stabilization of the bound form are located at least at 5.5 Å away47
from the crystallized ligand (defined by the closest distance between two heavy atoms on the
protein and ligand, respectively47) (Table IV). This suggests that at least some mutations in
positions located in the CDR H3 loop may be amenable to a design approach aiming to
stabilize the desired conformation without directly affecting ligand contacts. The remaining
two predicted positions are at least 3.7Å away from the ligand, making it difficult to predict
the effect of the mutation on ligand binding. However, for one of them (position 101 in
7G12), in vivo  affinity maturation data available17 validate our prediction (see next
paragraph).
Germline 7g12 antibody: a case in which somatic mutations increase hapten affinity by
stabilizing the CDR H3 loop in the bound conformation
The germline 7g12 antibody is the best structurally characterized example of somatic
mutations leading to an increase in hapten binding affinity through the stabilization of the
CDR H3 loop in the antigen bound conformation17,19. Table V shows the predicted
sequence profiles obtained for the CDR H3 loop of germline 7g12. In this case, the multi-
constraint design profiles recover native amino acid residues at four out of the five CDR H3
loop native positions, whereas the single-constraint simulations for the bound or free forms
recover native amino acid residues only at two and three positions, respectively. This is the
case even though the number of predicted different sequences in the profile for the bound
form (168) is substantially larger than those of the free and multi-constraint profiles (3 and
2, respectively). From the 7g12 profile, we identified two positions, 99 and 101, in which
multi-constraint as well as single-constraint design (for the free form) share similar
characteristics: charged residues are selected for position 99 (Arg, Glu) and small amino
acid residues for position 101 (Ala, Ser), respectively, recovering the native residues Arg
and Ser. In contrast, the amino acid residues present in the simulated profile for the single-
constraint bound form are large aromatics at both positions. Moreover, the differences in
score between the predicted best sequence and the native sequence for positions 99 and 101
in the bound form are substantial, suggesting that both positions could be further optimized.
This example illustrates how positions that are “constrained” by the free structure could be
good candidates for mutations to stabilize the CDR H3 loop in the conformation of the
bound form, likely increasing antibody-antigen affinity. Interestingly, we found that CDR
H3 loops from antibodies (extracted from the ArchDB database57), that adopt conformationsBabor and Kortemme Page 9

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptsimilar to that of the germline 7g12 bound form, have a Trp at position 99 (Fig. S4). This is
consistent with our prediction that large aromatic residues (including Trp, see Table V) may
stabilize the bound conformation. Another example is position 101, which undergoes a
somatic mutation during affinity maturation. Here, the single-constraint profile for the
structure of the hapten-bound form contains exclusively Phe, His and Met. Therefore, our
algorithm predicts that substitution of the native Ser in position 101 by a large hydrophobic
residue should stabilize the CDR H3 loop in the desired hapten-binding conformation.
Notably, Met has been selected in that position by in vivo  affinity maturation19, consistent
with our predictions.
DISCUSSION
Numerous studies have shown that germline antibodies display conformational flexibility, in
particular in their CDR H3 loop regions12–18,58. Furthermore, flexible antibodies have been
shown to bind multiple antigens in vitro , often through alternative conformations19,21. Thus,
germline antibody conformational flexibility has been proposed to be beneficial, as it may
enlarge the conformational repertoire available to the immune system7,8,11. In this work, we
investigated whether we can identify sequence signatures in native germline antibodies
responsible for CDR H3 loop flexibility. Towards this goal, we used computational protein
design to determine the extent to which native CDR H3 loop sequences are optimized for
their structures, in germline and mature antibodies whose free and bound forms show
different CDR H3 loop conformations. Computational protein design has previously shown
that, for most proteins, the low energy sequences for a given structure obtained from
computational re-design are close to the native protein sequences32–38,59. Our hypothesis
was that, if the native sequences of germline antibodies are optimized for flexibility, then
Rosetta-based multi-constraint design using multiple conformations as inputs should lead to
a high recovery of the germline native sequences. Indeed, we observed that for germline
antibodies the CDR H3 loop native sequence recovery is significantly higher when both
conformations are considered simultaneously in the design simulation, than when each of
the single conformations is used separately. In contrast, using the same design test we found
no significant differences in native sequence recovery for CDR H3 loops of mature
antibodies able to adopt at least two alternative conformations. Our results indicate that the
CDR H3 loop native sequences of germline antibodies represent compromises between the
sequence preferences of each of the individual conformational states analyzed. Our findings
suggest that germline CDR H3 loop sequences might be selected for flexibility.
Proteins sample an ensemble of conformations, even in their “native” states60,61. Hence,
using just two observed conformations, as in our simulations, is a substantial simplification
that is likely to underestimate the true flexibility. However, as this flexibility is not directly
accessible experimentally, we are limited to an analysis of the experimentally characterized
conformational states, which nevertheless yields considerable agreement between designed
multi-constraint and native sequences. That our method only identifies few positions
predicted to be involved in controlling flexibility may be explained by the fact that other
residues may be required for alternative conformations or sparsely-populated higher-energy
conformations that need to be sampled in transitions from one conformation to another, not
modeled here, as well as inaccuracies in design methods. By our method, some mature
antibodies also seem to show some evidence for a preference for flexibility (although
statistically not significant, P= 0.11). Again, as our analysis is restricted to two
experimentally observed conformations, it does not test the possibility that mature
antibodies sample a more restricted ensemble of solution conformations than germline
antibodies. A related point concerns the question of whether altered protein conformations
observed in different bound or functional states62–65 are already populated in the unbound
state. Our analysis describes which low energy sequences are consistent with a givenBabor and Kortemme Page 10
Proteins . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptconformation, but, as discussed above, does not evaluate conformational transitions or
populations of conformations in structural ensembles. In other words, we predict low energy
sequences given a target structure, but do not determine the inverse, the specificity or
population of a structure given its sequence. Therefore and in turn, our analysis does not
require the assumption that the bound structures are populated to a significant extent in the
unbound state.
Although the Rosetta full-atom energy function has been parameterized to recover native
sequences given the native backbone structure, the validity of the conclusions drawn here is
supported by several lines of evidence: First, the parameterization uses a large dataset that
should average out native bias for individual structures. This conclusion is consistent with
the finding that native sequence recovery on an independent test set is essentially the same
as on the training set24. In addition, native sequence recovery is also considerable when side
chains surrounding a designed position are redesigned simultaneously24. Second, the Rosetta
full-atom energy function has also been used to more directly assess the specificity of a
structure given the sequence. In applications in both ab initio  structure prediction66 and
model refinement67, the same full-atom energy function originally parameterized for
sequence design has been able to successfully guide the sampling and identification of near-
native protein structures. An extension of our current study would be to carry out refinement
simulations starting with native and designed sequences to more directly test the specificity
of the designed sequence for the target (native) structure. Third, our study provides an
“internal control” showing significant differences in sequence recovery for germline and
mature antibodies. Taken together, we believe these findings support the applicability of the
RosettaDesign energy function to the question addressed here.
Even though conformational flexibility could enlarge the conformational repertoire available
to respond to foreign antigens, the intrinsic flexibility of germline antibodies has to be
selected before the antibodies actually encounter foreign antigens for the first time. If so,
what are the selective pressures leading to native sequences of germline binding sites, in
particular CDR H3 loops, with intrinsic flexibility? During B cell development, clones
expressing antibodies that are either too reactive or not reactive at all against self-antigens
are negatively selected68,69. This eliminates, on one hand, B cell clones that could
potentially lead to autoimmune responses, and, on the other hand, clones leading to
defective B-cell receptors. Indeed, evidence indicates that clones capable of low avidity
interactions with self-ligands have the highest likelihood of maturation and survival68. Thus,
flexibility of germline antibodies serves two purposes: by sampling alternative
conformations, germline antibodies have higher chances to find binding partners; at the
same time, by being intrinsically flexible, they are less likely to bind any partner with too
high an affinity due to the entropic costs of ordering flexible regions upon binding. In this
way, an optimal intermediate affinity range can be achieved allowing survival of the B cell
clone. A consequence of that flexibility is then the ability to bind, again with a limited
number of possible antibody sequences, a larger number of antigens, even though this is not
the property that had been selected for originally.
Generation of sequence profiles for each of the multi- and single-constraint simulations lead
us to propose amino acid mutations along the CDR H3 loops that could increase the rigidity
of the CDR H3 loop bound conformation, reducing overall conformational flexibility. For
most of the proposed cases, the replacements suggested are unlikely to interfere with ligand
binding (see Results). Affinity maturation data available for the germline antibody 7g1217
are consistent with our predictions. Our strategy can serve to engineer antibodies with higher
affinity and specificity by designing mutations that preferentially stabilize a desired
conformation. Thus, identifying sequence determinants of conformational flexibility based
on a comparison of single- and multi-constraint design simulations computationally mimicsBabor and Kortemme Page 11

reducing H3 loop flexibility may explain the effect of other known mutations that, despite
being located away from the antibody-antigen interaction interface, cause affinity maturation
and cannot easily be rationalized using fixed backbone methods70,71. Furthermore, as the
sequence diversity sampled by computational methods is not restricted by the genetic
mechanisms that generate antibody diversity72, it is possible to explore areas of sequence
space that are otherwise not accessible to the natural antibody repertoire.

Structural",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to determine the impact of somatic mutations on the conformational flexibility of germline antibodies.,"Research Hypothesis:
The native sequences of CDR H3 loops from germline antibodies are nearly optimal for conformational flexibility, and mutations in the CDR H3 loop can stabilize the antigen-bound conformation, leading to increased antigen binding affinity.

Research Proposal:
To test the hypothesis, we propose to conduct a comprehensive computational and experimental study. The computational aspect will involve using multi-constraint protein design simulations, along with the Rosetta energy function, to predict mutations in the CDR H3 loop that can stabilize the antigen-bound conformation. This will be followed by experimental validation of the predicted mutations to assess their impact on antibody conformational flexibility and antigen binding affinity. Additionally, in vivo affinity maturation data will be analyzed to further validate the predictions. The method described in this study can be useful for designing antibodies with increased specificity and affinity by reducing antibody conformational diversity."
"Historically, natural products (NPs) have played a key 
role in drug discovery, especially for cancer and infec-
tious diseases1,2, but also in other therapeutic areas, 
including cardiovascular diseases (for example, statins) and multiple sclerosis (for example, fingolimod)
3–5.
NPs offer special features in comparison with con-
ventional synthetic molecules, which confer both advan-
tages and challenges for the drug discovery process. NPs are characterized by enormous scaffold diversity and structural complexity. They typically have a higher 
molecular mass, a larger number of 
sp3 carbon atoms  and 
oxygen atoms but fewer nitrogen and halogen atoms, higher numbers of H- bond acceptors and donors, lower 
calculated octanol–water partition coefficients (cLogP 
values, indicating higher hydrophilicity) and greater molecular rigidity compared with synthetic compound 
libraries
1,6–9. These differences can be advantageous; for 
example, the higher rigidity of NPs can be valuable in drug discovery tackling protein–protein interactions
10. 
Indeed, NPs are a major source of oral drugs ‘beyond 
Lipinski’s rule of five ’11. The increasing significance of 
drugs not conforming to this rule is illustrated by the increase in molecular mass of approved oral drugs over 
the past 20 years
12. NPs are structurally ‘optimized’ 
by evolution to serve particular biological functions1, 
including the regulation of endogenous defence mech -
anisms and the interaction (often competition) with other organisms, which explains their high relevance for infectious diseases and cancer. Furthermore, their use in traditional medicine may provide insights regarding 
efficacy and safety. Overall, the NP pool is enriched with ‘bioactive’ compounds covering a wider area of chemical 
space compared with typical synthetic small- molecule 
libraries
13.
Despite these advantages and multiple successful 
drug discovery examples, several drawbacks of NPs have led pharmaceutical companies to reduce NP-  based drug 
discovery programmes. NP screens typically involve a library of extracts from natural sources 
(Fig.  1), which 
may not be compatible with traditional target- based 
assays14. Identifying the bioactive compounds of inter -
est can be challenging, and dereplication  tools have to 
be applied to avoid rediscovery of known compounds. 
Accessing sufficient biological material to isolate and 
characterize a bioactive NP may also be challenging15. 
Furthermore, gaining intellectual property (IP) rights 
for (unmodified) NPs exhibiting relevant bioactivities 
can be a hurdle, since naturally occurring compounds in their original form may not always be patented (legal frameworks vary between countries and are evolving)
16, 
although simple derivatives can be patent- protected 
(Box  1). An additional layer of complexity relates to the 
regulations defining the need for benefit sharing with 
countries of origin of the biological material, framed 
in the United Nations 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol, which entered into force in 2014 
(reF.17), as well as recent developments con -
cerning benefit sharing linked to use of marine genetic 
resources18.

Abstract | Natural products and their structural analogues have historically made a major 
contribution to pharmacotherapy, especially for cancer and infectious diseases. Nevertheless, 
natural products also present challenges for drug discovery, such as technical barriers to screening, 
isolation, characterization and optimization, which contributed to a decline in their pursuit by  
the pharmaceutical industry from the 1990s onwards. In recent years, several technological and scientific developments — including improved analytical tools, genome mining and engineering 
strategies, and microbial culturing advances — are addressing such challenges and opening up 
new opportunities. Consequently, interest in natural products as drug leads is being revitalized, particularly for tackling antimicrobial resistance. Here, we summarize recent technological 
developments that are enabling natural product- based drug discovery, highlight selected 
applications and discuss key opportunities.

NP leads can be challenging, particularly if synthetic 
routes are difficult. Also, NP- based drug leads are 
often identified by phenotypic assays , and deconvolu-
tion of their molecular mechanisms of action can be 
time- consuming19. Fortunately, there have been sub-
stantial advances20 both in the development of screening 
assays (for example, harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells and gene editing technologies) 
and in strategies to identify the modes of action of active compounds (reviewed previously
21–23).
Here, we discuss recent technological and scien-
tific advances that may help to overcome challenges in NP- based drug discovery, with an emphasis on three areas: analytical techniques, genome mining and engi-neering, and cultivation systems. In the concluding sec-tion, we highlight promising future directions for NP drug discovery.

Classical NP-  based drug research starts with biological 
screening of ‘crude’ extracts to identify a bioactive ‘hit’ 
extract, which is further fractionated to isolate the active 
NPs. Bioactivity- guided isolation is a laborious process 
with a number of limitations, but various strategies and technologies can be used to address some of them 
(Fig.  2). 
For example, to create libraries that are compatible Problem 1

Fig. 1 | Outline of traditional bioactivity- guided isolation steps in natural product drug discovery. Steps in the  
process are shown in purple boxes, with associated key limitations shown in red boxes and advances that are helping to 
address these limitations in modern natural product (NP)- based drug discovery shown in green boxes. The process begins 
with extraction of NPs from organisms such as bacteria. The choice of extraction method determines which compound classes will be present in the extract (for example, the use of more polar solvents will result in a higher abundance of polar compounds in the crude extract). To maximize the diversity of the extracted NPs, the biological material can be subjected to extraction with several solvents of different polarity. Following the identification of a crude extract with promising pharmacological activity, the next step is its (often multiple) consecutive bioactivity- guided fractionation until the pure 
bioactive compounds are isolated. A key limitation for the potential of this approach to identify novel NPs is that many 
potential source organisms cannot be cultured or stop producing relevant NPs when taken out of their natural habitat. 
These limitations are being addressed through development of new methods for culturing, for in situ analysis, for NP synthesis induction and for heterologous expression of biosynthetic genes. At the crude extract step, challenges include the presence in the extracts of NPs that are already known, NPs that do not have drug- like properties or insufficient 
amounts of NPs for characterization. These challenges can be addressed through the development of methods for dereplication, extraction and pre- fractionation of extracts. Finally, at the last stage, when bioactive compounds are 
identified by phenotypic assays, significant time and effort are typically needed to identify the affected molecular targets. This challenge can be addressed by the development of methods for accelerated elucidation of molecular modes of action, 
such as the nematic protein organization technique (NPOT), drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), stable isotope 
labelling with amino acids in cell culture and pulse proteolysis (SILAC- PP), the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and an 
extension known as thermal proteome profiling (TPP), stability of proteins from rates of oxidation (SPROX), the similarity ensemble approach (SEA) and bioinformatics- based analysis of connectivity (connectivity map, CMAP)
23,189– 192.Lipinski’s rule of five
This guideline for the likelihood 
of a compound having oral 
bioavailability is based on 
several characteristics 
containing the number 5.  
it predicts that a molecule is likely to have poor absorption 
or permeation if it has more 
than one of the following 
characteristics: there are  
>5 H- bond donors and  
>10 H- bond acceptors; the 
molecular weight is > 500;  
or the partition coefficient LogP is > 5. Notably, natural 
products were identified as common exceptions at the 
time of publication in 1997.
Dereplication
Pharmacological screening of 
natural product extracts yields 
hits potentially containing 
multiple natural products that 
need to be considered for 
further study to identify  
the bioactive compounds. Dereplication is the process of recognizing and excluding from 
further study such hit mixtures 
that contain already known 
bioactive compounds.
Phenotypic assays
Assays that rely on the ability 
of tested compounds to exert 
desired phenotypic changes  
in cells, isolated tissues, organs or animals. They offer a 
complementary strategy  
to target- based assays for 
identifying new potential drugs.

with high- throughput screening, crude extracts can be 
pre- fractionated into sub- fractions that are more suit-
able for automated liquid handling systems. In addi-
tion, fractionation methods can be adjusted so that sub- fractions preferentially contain compounds with 
drug- like properties (typically moderate hydrophilicity). 
Such approaches can increase the number of hits com-pared with using crude extracts, as well as enabling more efficient follow- up of promising hits
24.
Metabolomics was developed as an approach to 
simultaneously analyse multiple metabolites in biologi-cal samples. Enabled by technological developments in chromatography and spectrometry, metabolomics was historically applied first in other research fields, such as 
biomedical and agricultural sciences
2. Advances in the 
analytical instrumentation used in NP research25,26, cou-
pled with computational approaches that can generate plausible NP analogue structures and their respective 
simulated spectra
27, have also enabled application of 
‘omics’ approaches such as metabolomics in NP- based 
drug discovery. Metabolomics can provide accurate infor -
mation on the metabolite composition in NP extracts, thus helping to prioritize NPs for isolation, to accelerate dereplication
28,29 and to annotate unknown analogues 
and new NP scaffolds. Moreover, metabolomics can 
detect differences between metabolite compositions in 
various physiological states of producing organisms and enable the generation of hypotheses to explain them,  
and can also provide extensive metabolite profiles to 
underpin phenotypic characterization at the molecular 
level
30. Both options are very useful in understanding the 
molecular mechanisms of action of NPs.
For metabolite profiling, NP extracts are analysed by 
NMR spectroscopy or high- resolution mass spectrom-
etry (HRMS), or respective combined methods involv-ing upstream liquid chromatography (LC)
31,32, such as  
LC–HRMS, which can separate numerous isomers pres -
ent in NP extracts33. Moreover, such combined methods 
might integrate HRMS and NMR, allowing the simulta-
neous use of the advantages of both techiques34,35. NMR 
analysis of NP extracts is simple and reproducible, and provides direct quantitative information and detailed 
structural information, although it has relatively low sen-sitivity, meaning that it generally enables profiling only of major constituents
33. The applications of NMR in NP 
research are versatile36 and the technique is used both 
directly for metabolomics of unfractionated NP extracts and for structural characterization of compounds and fractions obtained with appropriate separation methods, most often LC. HRMS is the gold standard for qualita-
tive and quantitative metabolite profiling
33 and is most 
commonly applied in combination with LC. HRMS can also be used in the direct infusion mode (called DIMS)
37, 
whereby samples are directly profiled by MS without a chromatography step, or in MS imaging (MSI)
38, which 
enables determination of the spatial distribution of NPs within living organisms. HRMS enables routine acqui-
sition of accurate molecular mass information, which together with appropriate heuristic filtering can pro-vide unambiguous assignment of molecular formulae 
for hundreds to thousands of metabolites within a sin-
gle extract over a dynamic range that may exceed five Box 1 | Natural products that activate the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway
an example of a pathway affected by diverse natural products (NPs) is the KeaP1/NrF2 
pathway. This pathway regulates the expression of networks of genes encoding proteins with versatile cytoprotective functions and has essential roles in the maintenance 
 
of redox and protein homeostasis, mitochondrial biogenesis and the resolution of inflammation
196– 199.
activation of this pathway can protect against damage by most types of oxidants and 
pro- inflammatory agents, and it restores redox and protein homeostasis200. The pathway 
has therefore attracted attention for the development of drugs for the prevention  
and treatment of complex diseases, including neurological conditions such as  
relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis201 and autism spectrum disorder202.
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the methyl ester of the NP fumarate (a tricarboxylic acid  
(Tca) cycle intermediate that is found in both animals and plants), is one of the earliest discovered inducers of the KeaP1/NrF2 pathway
203, 204. The origins of the development of 
DMF as a drug date back to the use in traditional medicine of the plant Fumaria officinalis. 
Initially, fumaric acid derivatives were used for the treatment of psoriasis as it was 
thought that psoriasis is caused by a metabolic deficiency in the Tca cycle that could  
be compensated for by repletion of fumarate205. Despite this erroneous assumption,  
DMF is effective in treating psoriasis, both topically and orally, and is the active principle 
of Fumaderm, which has been used clinically for several decades in the treatment of plaque psoriasis in Germany. More recently, a DMF formulation developed by Biogen has been 
tested in other immunological disorders, with successful phase III trials in multiple 
sclerosis
206, 207 leading to its approval by the FDa and eMa in 2013.
The isothiocyanate sulforaphane, isolated from broccoli (Brassica oleracea)208, is among 
the most potent naturally occurring inducers of the KeaP1/NrF2 pathway209 and has 
protective effects in animal models of Parkinson210, huntington211 and alzheimer212 
diseases, traumatic brain injury213, spinal cord contusion injury214, stroke215, depression216 
and multiple sclerosis217. Sulforaphane- rich broccoli extract preparations are being 
developed as preventive interventions in areas of the world with unavoidable exposure  
to environmental pollutants, such as china; the initial results of a randomized clinical trial 
showed rapid and sustained, statistically significant increases in the levels of excretion  
of the glutathione- derived conjugates of benzene and acrolein218, and a follow- up trial 
(NcT02656420) also demonstrated dose–response- dependent benzene detoxification219. 
In a placebo- controlled, double- blind, randomized clinical trial in young individuals  
(age 13–27 years) with autism spectrum disorder, sulforaphane reversed many of the clinical abnormalities
202; these encouraging findings led to a recently completed clinical 
trial in children (age 3–12 years) (NcT02561481; results of the trial are not yet publicly available). an α- cyclodextrin complex of sulforaphane known as SFX-01 (developed by 
evgen Pharma) is being clinically studied for its potential to reverse resistance to endocrine therapies in patients with er
+her2- metastatic breast cancer (phase II trial completed220) 
and in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (phase II trial NcT02614742 recently completed; results not yet publicly available). currently, a clinical trial of SFX-01 in patients 
hospitalized with covID-19 is in its final stages of preparation.
Finally, the pentacyclic triterpenoids bardoxolone methyl (also known as rTa 402) and 
omaveloxolone (r Ta 408), which are semi- synthetic derivatives of the NP oleanolic acid, 
are the most potent (active at nanomolar concentrations) activators of the KeaP1/NrF2 
pathway known to date
221. These compounds have shown protective effects in numerous 
animal models of chronic disease222, and are currently in clinical trials for a wide range  
of indications, such as chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes, pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, melanoma, radiation dermatitis, ocular inflammation and Friedreich’s ataxia
200. Most recently, bardoxolone methyl has entered a clinical trial in patients 
hospitalized with confirmed covID-19 (NcT04494646).

orders of magnitude31,39. However, challenges remain in 
data mining and in the unambiguous identification of 
the metabolites using various workflows relying on open 
web-  based tools40.
Dereplication of secondary metabolites in bioactive 
extracts includes the determination of molecular mass and formula and cross- searching in the literature or 
structural NP databases with taxonomic information, which greatly assists the identification process. Such 
metadata, which are difficult to query in the literature, 
are often compiled in proprietary databases, such as the Dictionary of Natural Products, which encompasses 
all NP structures reported with links to their biological 
sources (see Related links). However, a comprehensive 
experimental tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data-base of all NPs reported to date does not exist, and a search for experimental spectra across various platforms 
is hindered by the lack of standardized collision energy 
conditions for fragmentation in LC–MS/MS
25.In this respect, the Global Natural Products Social 
(GNPS) molecular networking platform developed in the Dorrestein laboratory is an important addition to the toolbox
41. Molecular networking organizes thou-
sands of sets of MS/MS data recorded from a given set 
of extracts and visualizes the relationship of the ana-
lytes as clusters of structurally related molecules. This improves the efficiency of dereplication by enabling annotation of isomers and analogues of a given metab-
olite in a cluster
42. The recorded experimental spectra 
can be searched against putative structures and their corresponding predicted MS/MS spectra generated 
by tools such as competitive fragmentation modelling (CFM- ID)
43. Based on such approaches, vast databases 
of theoretical NP spectra have been created and applied 
in dereplication44. The GNPS molecular networking 
approach has limitations, however, such as better appli-cability to some classes of NPs than others and the 
uncertainty of structural assignment among possible Bacterial strains isolated from

a | An illustrative example of the application of liquid chromatography–high- resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS) 
metabolomics in the screening of natural product (NP) extracts is the work of Kurita et al.58, in which 234 bacterial extracts 
were subjected to image- based phenotypic bioactivity screening and LC–HRMS metabolomics. Clustering of the resulting 
data allowed prioritization of promising extracts for further analysis, resulting in the discovery of the new NPs, quinocin-
nolinomycins A–D. b | Another illustrative example of LC–HRMS screening of NP extracts is the work of Clevenger et al.85,

LC–HRMS metabolomics data with a FAC- Score algorithm directed the simultaneous discovery of 15 new NPs and  
the characterization of their BGCs.

predicted candidates. Efforts to address such issues are 
ongoing45–47, including overlaying molecular networks of 
large NP extract libraries with taxonomic information to 
improve the confidence of annotation48. Overall, molec-
ular networking mainly allows better prioritization of the isolation of unknown compounds by strengthen-
ing the dereplication process and elucidating relation-ships between NP analogues, and rigorous structure elucidation for NPs of interest should not be neglected.
Another useful platform for metabolite identifica-
tion is METLIN
49, which includes a high- resolution 
MS/MS database with a fragment similarity search 
function that is useful for identification of unknown 
compounds. Other databases and in silico tools such as Compound Structure Identification (CSI): FingerID and Input Output Kernel Regression (IOKR) can be used 
to search available fragment ion spectra, as well as to 
generate predicted spectra of fragment ions not present in current databases
50. A novel computational platform 
for predicting the structural identity of metabolites 
derived from any identified compound has also been 
recently reported51, which should increase the searchable 
chemical space of NPs.
To accelerate the identification of bioactive NPs in 
extracts, metabolomics data can be matched to the bio-logical activities of these extracts
52. Various chemometric 
methods such as multivariate data analysis can correlate 
the measured activity with signals in the NMR and MS 
spectra, enabling the active compounds to be traced in complex mixtures with no need for further bioassays
53–55. 
Furthermore, several analytical modules involving dif -
ferent bioassays and detection technologies can be linked to allow simultaneous bioactivity evaluation and identification of compounds present in small amounts (analytical scale) in complex compound mixtures
34,35.
Metabolomics data can be integrated with data 
obtained by other omics techniques such as transcrip-tomics and proteomics and/or with imaging- based 
screens. For example, Acharya et al. used this approach to characterize NP- mediated interactions between a 
Micromonospora  species and a Rhodococcus  species
56. 
In another interesting example, Kurita et al. developed a 
compound activity mapping platform for the prediction 
of identities and mechanisms of action of constituents from complex NP extract libraries by integrating cyto-logical profiling
57 with untargeted metabolomics data 
from a library of extracts58, and identified quinocinno-
linomycins as a new family of NPs causing endoplasmic 
reticulum stress58 (Fig.  2a).
Analytical advances that enable the profiling of 
responses to bioactive molecules at the single- cell  
level can also accelerate NP- based drug discovery. Irish, 
Bachmann, Earl and colleagues developed a high-   
throughput platform for metabolomic profiling of bio-
activity by integrating phospho- specific flow cytometry, 
single- cell chemical biology and cellular barcoding with 
metabolomic arrays (characterized chromatographic 
microtitre arrays originating from biological extracts)59. 
Using this platform, the authors studied the single- cell 
responses of bone marrow biopsy samples from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia following exposure to microbial metabolomic arrays obtained from extracts of biosynthetically prolific bacteria, which enabled the 
identification of new bioactive polyketides
59.
Finally, advances in analytical technologies con-
tinue to support the rigorous structure determination 
of NPs of interest. The progressive development of higher- field NMR instruments and probe technology
60,61 
has enabled NP structure determination from very small 
quantities (below 10 µg)62,63, which is important, as the 
available quantities of NPs are often limited. In addi-tion, microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) has 
recently emerged as a cryo- electron microscopy- based 
technique for unambiguous structure determination of small molecules
64 and is already finding important 
applications in NP research65. The increased resolution 
and sensitivity of analytical equipment can also help 
address problems associated with ‘residual complex-
ity’ of isolated NPs; that is when biologically potent but unidentified impurities in an isolated NP sample (which could include structurally related metabolites or 
conformers) lead to an incorrect assignment of structure 
and/or activity
66,67. To avoid futile downstream develop-
ment efforts, Pauli and colleagues recommended that 
lead NPs should undergo advanced purity analysis at an 
early stage using quantitative NMR and LC–MS67.
Genome mining and engineering
Advances in knowledge on biosynthetic pathways for NPs and in developing tools for analysing and manipulating 
genomes are further key drivers for modern NP- based 
drug discovery. Two key characteristics enable the iden-
tification of biosynthetic genes in the genomes of the producing organisms. First, these genes are clustered in 
the genomes of bacteria and filamentous fungi. Second, 
many NPs are based on polyketide or peptide cores, and their biosynthetic pathways involve enzymes —  
polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide 
synthetases (NRPSs), respectively — that are encoded by 
large genes with highly conserved modules
68.
‘Genome mining’ is based on searches for genes 
that are likely to govern biosynthesis of scaffold struc -
tures, and can be used to identify NP biosynthetic gene clusters
69–71. Prioritization of gene clusters for further 
work is facilitated by advances in biosynthetic know-
ledge and predictive bioinformatics tools, which can pro-
vide hints about whether the metabolic products of the  
clusters have chemical scaffolds that are new or known, thereby supporting dereplication
72,73. Such predictive 
tools for gene cluster analysis can be applied in combi-
nation with spectroscopic techniques to accelerate the 
identification of NPs65 and determine the stereochem -
istry of metabolic products66. Furthermore, to extend 
genome mining from a single genome to entire genera, 
microbiomes or strain collections, computational tools 
have been developed, such as BiG- SCAPE, which enables 
sequence similarity analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters, and CORASON, which uses a 
phylogenomic approach  
to elucidate evolutionary relationships between gene 
clusters74.
Phylogenetic studies of known groups of talented 
secondary metabolite producers can also empower 
discovery of novel NPs. Recently, a study comparing secondary metabolite profiles and phylogenetic data in Phylogenomic approach
The use of genomic data to 
reveal evolutionary 
relationships. in the context of 
natural product drug discovery, 
the use of phylogenomics is 
based on the assumption that 
organisms that have closer 
evolutionary relationships are 
more likely to produce similar 
natural products.

myxobacteria demonstrated a correlation between the 
taxonomic distance  and the production of distinct sec-
ondary metabolite families75. In filamentous fungi, it was 
likewise shown that secondary metabolite profiles are 
closely correlated with their phylogeny76. These organ-
isms are rich in secondary metabolites, as demonstrated by LC–MS studies of their extracts under laboratory 
conditions
77. Concurrent genomic and phylogenomic 
analyses implied that even the genomes of well- studied 
organism groups harbour many gene clusters for sec-ondary metabolite biosynthesis with as yet unknown functions
78. The phylogeny of biosynthetic gene clusters, 
together with analysis of the absence of known resistance 
determinants, was recently used to prioritize members of 
the glycopeptide antibiotic family that could have novel activities. This led to the identification of the known antibiotic complestatin and the newly discovered cor -
bomycin as compounds that act through a previously uncharacterized mechanism involving inhibition of  
peptidoglycan remodelling
79.
Many microorganisms cannot be cultured, or tools 
for their genetic manipulation are not sufficiently developed, which makes it more challenging to access their NP- producing potential. However, biosynthetic 
gene clusters for NPs can be cloned and heterologously 
expressed in organisms that are well- characterized 
and easier to culture and to genetically manipulate 
(such as Streptomyces coelicolor , Escherichia coli  and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae )
80. The aim is to achieve 
higher production titres in the heterologous hosts 
than in wild- type strains, improving the availability of 
lead compounds80–82. Vectors that can carry large DNA 
inserts are needed for the cloning of complete NP bio-synthetic gene clusters. Cosmids (which can have inserts 
of 30–40 kb), fosmids (which can harbour 40–50 kb) and 
bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs; which can have inserts of 100 kb to >300 kb) have been developed
83. For 
fungal gene clusters, self- replicating fungal artificial 
chromosomes (FACs) have been developed, which can have inserts of >100 kb 
(reF.84). FACs in combination 
with metabolomic scoring were used to develop a scal-
able platform, FAC- MS, allowing the characterization 
of fungal biosynthetic gene clusters and their respec-
tive NPs at unprecedented scale85. The application of 
FAC- MS for the screening of 56 biosynthetic gene clus-
ters from different fungal species yielded the discovery of 15 new metabolites, including a new macrolactone,  
valactamide A
85 (Fig.  2b).
Even in culturable microorganisms, many biosyn-
thetic gene clusters may not be expressed under con-ventional culture conditions, and these silent clusters could represent a large untapped source of NPs with drug- like properties
86. Several approaches can be pur -
sued to identify such NPs. One approach is sequencing, 
bioinformatic analysis and heterologous expression 
of silent biosynthetic gene clusters, which has already led to the discovery of several new NP scaffolds from cultivable strains
87. Direct cloning and heterologous 
expression was also used to discover the new antibiotic 
taromycin A, which was identified upon the transfer 
of a silent 67 kb NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster from 
Saccharomonospora  sp. CNQ-490 into S. coelicolor88.  To transfer a biosynthetic gene cluster of such size, a plat-
form based on transformation- associated recombination 
(TAR) cloning was developed. This platform enables 
direct cloning and manipulation of large biosynthetic gene clusters in S. cerevisiae, maintenance and manipula-
tion of the vector in E. coli, and heterologous expression 
of the cloned gene clusters in Actinobacteria (such as  
S. coelicolor ) following chromosomal integration
88, and 
is an alternative to BACs for heterologous expression of 
large biosynthetic gene clusters.
Heterologous expression has limitations, such as 
the need to clone and manipulate very large genome 
regions occupied by biosynthetic gene clusters and the 
difficulty of identifying a suitable host that provides all 
conditions necessary for the production of the corre-sponding NPs. These limitations can be circumvented by activating biosynthetic gene clusters directly in the 
native microorganism through targeted genetic manip-
ulations, generally involving the insertion of activating regulatory elements or deletion of inhibitory elements such as repressors or their binding sites. For example, 
a derepression strategy of deleting gbnR, a gene for a 
transcriptional repressor in Streptomyces venezuelae  
ATCC 10712 was used by Sidda et al. in the discovery of gaburedins, a family of γ- aminobutyrate- derived ureas
89. 
An example of the activator-  based strategy is the consti -
tutive expression of the samR0484 gene in Streptomyces ambofaciens  ATCC 23877, which led to the discovery 
of stambomycins A–D, 51- membered cytotoxic glyco-
sylated macrolides
72. Alternatively, silent biosynthetic 
gene clusters can be activated using repressor decoys90, 
which have the same DNA nucleotide sequence as the 
binding sites for the repressors that prevent the expres-
sion of the clusters. When these decoys are introduced into the bacteria, they sequester the respective repres-sors, and the ‘endogenous’ binding sites in the genome 
remain unoccupied, leading to derepression of the pre-
viously silent biosynthetic genes and production of the corresponding NPs. This approach has been applied to activate eight silent biosynthetic gene clusters in multi-
ple streptomycetes and led to the characterization of a 
novel NP , oxazolepoxidomycin A
90. The repressor decoy 
strategy is simpler, easier and faster to perform than the 
deletion of genes encoding regulatory factors. However, 
it has the same limitation as other approaches that rely on the introduction of recombinant DNA molecules into cells: it is necessary to develop protocols for efficient 
introduction of DNA into the targeted host strain, and 
the decoy must be maintained on a high- copy plasmid 
to ensure efficient repressor sequestration.
Another approach focused on exchange of regu-
latory elements is based on the CRISPR–Cas9 technol-ogy. The promise of this technique is exemplified in a recent work by Zhang et al., which demonstrated that CRISPR–Cas9- mediated targeted promoter introduction 
can efficiently activate diverse biosynthetic gene clusters in multiple Streptomyces  species, leading to the produc-
tion of unique metabolites, including a novel polyketide in Streptomyces viridochromogenes
91. The CRISPR–Cas9 
technology was also used to knock out genes encoding 
two well- known and frequently rediscovered anti-
biotics in several actinomycete strains, which led to the T axonomic distance
The distance of compared taxa 
on a constructed phylogenetic 
tree (also known as an 
evolutionary tree). Closer 
distance of compared taxa 
indicates a closer evolutionary 
relationship.

production of different rare and previously unknown 
variants of antibiotics that were otherwise obscured, 
including amicetin, thiolactomycin, phenanthroviridin 
and 5- chloro-3- formylindole92.
Approaches that rely on sequencing, bioinformat -
ics and heterologous expression can also enable the identification of novel NPs from bacterial strains that have not yet been cultivated 
(Fig.  3a). For example, 
Hover et al. searched the metagenomes of 2,000 soil 
samples for biosynthetic gene clusters for lipopeptides 
with calcium- binding motifs. This led to the discov-
ery of malacidins, members of the calcium- dependent 
antibiotic family, via heterologous expression of a 72 kb 
biosynthetic gene cluster from a desert soil sample in a Streptomyces albus  host strain
93 (Fig.  3b). However, in 
comparison with some of the other above- discussed 
strategies72,89,90, this metagenome-  based discovery 
approach is more suited to finding new members of 
known NP classes rather than discovery of entirely 
new classes. In another study, Chu et al. developed a human microbiome- based approach that identified 
nonribosomal linear heptapeptides called humimycins 
as novel antibiotics active against methicillin- resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA)
94 (Fig.  3c). The structure 
of the NPs was predicted via bioinformatics analysis of gene clusters found in human commensal bacteria, fol-
lowed by their chemical synthesis. A major strength of this innovative approach is that it is entirely independent of microbial cultivation and heterologous gene expres -
sion. Nevertheless, there are limitations related to the accuracy of computational chemical structure predic-tions and the feasibility of total chemical synthesis if structures are complex.
The genomes of plants or animals can also be mined 
for novel NPs. For example, mining of 116 plant genomes enabled by identification of a precursor gene for the biosynthesis of lyciumins, a class of branched cyclic 
ribosomal peptides with hypotensive action produced 
by Lycium barbarum  (popularly known as goji), identi-
fied diverse novel lyciumin chemotypes in seven other plants, including crops such as soybean, beet, quinoa and 
eggplant
95. Genome mining in the animal kingdom is 
exemplified by the work of Dutertre et al., which used an integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approach 
to discover thousands of novel venom peptides from Conus marmoreus  snails
96. Proteomics analysis revea-
led that the vast majority of the conopeptide diversity  was derived from a set of ~100 genes through variable peptide processing
96.
Some bioactive compounds initially isolated from 
marine organisms might be products of symbionts, and genome mining can facilitate the characterization of such NPs. For example, it has been shown that bio  active 
compounds from the sponge Theonella swinhoei  are pro -
duced by bacterial symbionts
97, and characterization of 
the symbiont ‘Candidatus  Entotheonella serta’ using 
single- cell genomics led to the discovery of gene clus-
ters for misakinolide and theonellamide biosynthesis98. 
Another example of a marine NP produced by a bacte-
rial symbiont is ET-743 (trabectedin), originally isolated 
from the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinate. A meta-omics approach developed by Rath et al. revealed that the producer of this clinically used anticancer agent is the 
bacterial symbiont ‘Candidatus  Endoecteinascidia 
frumentensis’
99.
Similarly, plant microbiomes also represent a large 
reservoir for the identification of novel bioactive NPs 
(such as the antitumour agents maytansine, paclitaxel and camptothecin, which were initially isolated from plants and later shown to be produced by microbial 
endophytes)
100 that can be tapped by genome mining 
approaches. An illustrative example is a recent work by Helfrich et al. that identified hundreds of novel bio-
synthetic gene clusters by genome mining of 224 bac-terial strains isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana  leaves
101. 
A combination of bioactivity screening and imaging mass 
spectrometry was used to select a single species for fur -
ther genomic analysis and led to the isolation of a NP with 
an unprecedented structure, the trans - acyltransferase 
PKS- derived antibiotic macrobrevin101.
Targeted genetic engineering of NP biosynthetic gene 
clusters can be of high value if the producing organism is difficult to cultivate or the yield of a NP is too low to allow comprehensive NP characterization. Rational genetic engineering and heterologous expression con-
tributed to increase the production of vioprolides, a 
depsi  peptide class of anticancer and antifungal NPs in 
the myxobacterium Cystobacter violaceus  Cb vi35, by 
several orders of magnitude. In addition, non-natural 
vio prolide analogues were generated by this approach
102. 
Similarly, promoter engineering and heterologous 
expres  sion of biosynthetic gene clusters was reported 
to result in a 7- fold increase in the production of the 
cytotoxic NP disorazol103, and a 328- fold increase in 
the production of spinosad, an insecticidal macrolide  
produced by the bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa104.
Besides increasing NP yields, targeted gene manip-
ulation can also be used to alter biosynthetic pathways  
in a predictable manner to produce new NP analogues 
with improved pharmacological properties, such as  
higher specific activity, lower toxicity and better pharma-
cokinetics. Such biosynthetic engineering approaches  
depend on a solid understanding of the biosynthetic 
pathway leading to a specific NP , access to the genes specifying this pathway and the ability to manipulate 
them in either the original or a hetero  logous host. 
Recent advances in biosynthetic engineering have 
enabled faster and more efficient production of NP analogues, including the development of methods for Fig. 3 | Strategies for genome mining- driven discovery of natural products and 
natural product- like compounds. a | Genome mining- based approaches to explore  
the biosynthetic capacity of microorganisms rely on DNA extraction, sequencing and 
bioinformatics analysis. The vast majority of microbes from different environments  
and microbiota communities have not been cultured, and their capacity to produce natural products (NPs) was largely inaccessible until recently. In the case of unculturable microorganisms, the bioinformatics analysis step can be followed by either targeted heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) prioritized as being likely to yield relevant new NPs or direct chemical synthesis of ‘synthetic–bioinformatic’  
NP- like compounds. b,c | These two approaches are exemplified by the recent discoveries 
of malacidins (panel b) and humimycins (panel c), respectively

accelerated engineering and recombination of modules 
of PKS gene clusters105, NRPSs106, 107 and NRPS–PKS 
assembly lines108, as well as elucidation of mechanisms 
for polyketide chain release that are contributing to 
NP structural diversification109, 110. Examples of bio-
synthetic engineering applied to several important NPs include the generation of analogues of the immuno-
suppressant rapamycin
111, the antitumour agents  
mithramycin112 and bleomycin113, and the antifungal 
agent nystatin114.
It should be noted that biosynthetic engineering has 
limitations regarding the parts of the NP molecule that can be targeted for modifications, and the chemical groups that can be introduced or removed. Considering the complexity of many NPs, however, total synthesis 
may be prohibitively costly, and a combined approach 
of biosynthetic engineering and chemical modification can provide a viable alternative for identifying improved drug candidates. For example, biosynthetic engineering 
may create a ‘handle’ for addition of a beneficial chem-
ical group by synthetic chemistry, as demonstrated for the biosynthetically engineered analogues of nystatin mentioned above; further synthetic chemistry modifi-
cations resulted in compounds with improved in vivo 
pharmacotherapeutic characteristics compared with amphotericin B
115,116.
Advances in microbial culturing systems
The complex regulation of NP biosynthesis in response to the environment means that the conditions under 
which producing organisms are cultivated can have a 
major impact on the chance of identifying novel NPs
87. 
Several strategies have been developed to improve the 
likelihood of identifying novel NPs compared with 
mono  culture under standard laboratory conditions  
and to make ‘uncultured’ microorganisms grow in a  
simulated natural environment117 (Fig.  4).
One well- established approach to promote the identi-
fication of novel NPs is the modulation of culture condi-
tions such as temperature, pH and nutrient sources. This strategy may lead to activation of silent gene clusters, thereby promoting production of different NPs. The 
term ‘One Strain Many Compounds’ (OSMAC) was 
coined for this approach about 20 years ago
118, but the 
concept has a longer history119, with its use being routine 
in industrial microbiology since the 1960s120.
While OSMAC is still widely used for the identifi -
cation of new bioactive compounds121,122, this approach 
has limited capacity to mimic the complexities of natu-
ral habitats. It is difficult to predict the combination of 
cues (which might also involve metabolites secreted by other members of the microbial community) to which the microorganism has evolved to respond by switching 
metabolic programmes. To account for such kinds of 
interactions, co-  culturing using ‘helper’ strains can be 
applied
123. This can enable the production and identifica-
tion of new NPs, as illustrated by recent studies in which 
particular fungi were co-  cultured with Streptomcyes  
species124,125.

Antibody–antigen complexes challenge our understanding, as analyses to date failed to
unveil the key determinants of binding affinity and interaction specificity. We partially
fill this gap based on novel quantitative analyses using two standardized databases,
the IMGT/3Dstructure-DB and the structure affinity benchmark. First, we introduce a
statistical analysis of interfaces which enables the classification of ligand types (protein,
peptide, and chemical; cross-validated classification error of 9.6%) and yield binding
affinity predictions of unprecedented accuracy (median absolute error of 0.878 kcal/mol).
Second, we exploit the contributions made by CDRs in terms of position at the interface
and atomic packing properties to show that in general, VH CDR3 and VL CDR3 make
dominant contributions to the binding affinity, a fact also shown to be consistent with
the enthalpy–entropy compensation associated with preconfiguration of CDR3. Our work
suggests that the affinity prediction problem could be partially solved from databases of
high resolution crystal structures of complexes with known affinity.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Immunoglobulins and the Immune Response
Adaptive immunity is based on antigen (Ag)-specific lymphocyte responses. Upon specific recog-
nition of an antigenic epitope by a given receptor unique to a lymphocyte, this cell gets activated
and proliferates, leading to a clonal expansion. B lymphocytes thus recognize antigens through
membrane-bound immunoglobulins (Ig) expressed at their surface. Seric Igs can opsonize bacteria
and facilitate their uptake by phagocytes or neutralize viruses thus preventing recognition by their
receptor or fusion with the target cell. Immunoglobulins fundamentally consist of two identical
heavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains, each H chain being bound to an L chain. The
antigen-binding site is located at the top of the paired VH and VL, and generally overlaps the two
V domains. It mainly consists of three flexible loops on each V domain, called complementarity
determining regions (CDR1–3). The diversity of antibodies is concentrated in the CDRs.
From the structural standpoint, the functional relevance of an Ig depends on its binding affinity
for the targeted antigen and the specificity of the interactions, which provides the basis of immune

memory and vaccination. The affinity sets the strength of the
interaction. For the membrane-bound Ig, it determines if enough
aggregationofsurfaceIgsandIgco-receptorsoccurs,sothatasuf-
ficient signal can be sent to the cell to induce activation and pro-
liferation ( 1). For secreted Ig, once bound to the target, pathogens
or host infected/tumoral cells, the affinity sets the efficiency
of Ig-mediated pathogen opsonization and/or neutralization, or
Ig effector properties (antibody-dependent cell-cytotoxicity or
ADCC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity or CDC) ( 2).
1.2. Ig–Ag Complexes and Underlying
Genetic Mechanisms
The prominent role played in Ag binding by CDRs has prompted
the analysis of CDR-specific statistics. Using a handful of crys-
tallographic structures, canonical conformations, i.e., commonly
occurring backbone CDR conformations were first reported ( 3)
and subsequently updated ( 4,5), using 300 non-redundant Ig
structures in the latest work ( 6). Moving from individual CDR
to all CDRs, correlations between canonical conformations were
further studied ( 7), highlighting the fact that some combinations
are multi-specific, while others are specific of an antigen type.
The VH CDR3 is the most variable and was therefore the focus of
severalstudies( 8–10)whichdefinedandupdatedsequence-based
rules to predict its conformations. More recently, these studies
have been refined, based on a larger number of structures (of the
order of hundreds instead of tens). For VL CDR3, new canonical
conformations were proposed ( 11), and for VH CDR3, previous
rules were updated and complemented ( 12,13). Distinguishing
lambdaversuskappachains,ithasbeenshownthatcanonicalcon-
formations from the former are more diverse than those from the
latter in the human and the mouse ( 14). However, the relevance of

matched (or even outperformed) the prediction performances
of methods exploiting specific rules associated with canonical
conformations of CDRs. In parallel, two related works ( 16,17)
studied the differential CDR lengths and Specificity-Determining
Residues Usage (SDRU, proportion of Ig amino acids at a given
CDR position which contact the antigen) between ligand types.
However, these analyses do not allow antigen type predictions.
To assess the role of individual CDRs, it has also been established
that except in the case of bacterial carbohydrates, diversity in VH

(18). Structural and genetic aspects of individual CDRs in natural
and artificial antibody repertoires are reviewed in Ref. ( 19).
1.3. Ig–Ag Complexes and
Thermodynamics
The analysis of Ig–Ag complexes can also be posed from the
thermodynamics standpoint. Specifically, the binding affinity is
a thermodynamic quantity describing the chemical equilibrium
associated with the two partners (Ig and Ag in our case) and
the complex [Ig–Ag, denoted IG/Ag in the IMGT nomencla-
ture (20)]. It is generally measured by the dissociation constant
Kd(=[Ig][Ag]/[Ig–Ag]) of this equilibrium. Equivalently, it is
expressed by the corresponding dissociation free energy

The key determinants of binding affinity and interaction specificity in antibody-antigen complexes can be investigated by analyzing the contributions made by complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in terms of position at the interface and atomic packing properties.

Research Proposal:
To investigate the key determinants of binding affinity and interaction specificity in antibody-antigen complexes, we propose to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the contributions made by CDRs in terms of position at the interface and atomic packing properties. This analysis will involve utilizing high resolution crystal structures of complexes with known affinity to understand the structural parameters that yield a quantitative description of interaction specificity and binding affinity. Additionally, statistical analysis of interfaces will be used to classify ligand types and predict binding affinity with unprecedented accuracy."

Abstract
The formulation and delivery of biopharmaceutical drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies and 
recombinant proteins, poses substantial challenges owing to their large size and susceptibility to 
degradation. In this Review we highlight recent advances in formulation and delivery strategies — 
such as the use of microsphere-based controlled-release technologies, protein modification 
methods that make use of polyethylene glycol and other polymers, and genetic manipulation of 
biopharmaceutical drugs — and discuss their advantages and limitations. We also highlight 
current and emerging delivery routes that provide an alternative to injection, including 
transdermal, oral and pulmonary delivery routes. In addition, the potential of targeted and 
intracellular protein delivery is discussed.
In the past three decades since the launch of recombinant human insulin, biopharmaceutical 
drugs — including peptides, recombinant therapeutic proteins, enzymes, monoclonal 
antibodies and antibody–drug conjugates — have transformed the pharmaceutical industry. 
From 1989 to 2012 the number of marketed biotechnology products grew from 13 to 210, 
while worldwide product sales increased to US$163 billion1. Biotech products accounted for 
71% of the worldwide revenue generated by the ten top-selling pharmaceuticals in 2012, up 
from 7% in 2001 (REF. 1). This transformation has similarly affected development

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptpipelines. Over 900 biopharmaceutical products are currently in development, targeting 
diseases across a wide range of therapeutic areas and representing nearly 20% of the total 
number of drugs in the pipeline2. About 40% of these products are being developed by large 
pharmaceutical companies1.
As a class, biopharmaceutical drugs offer the advantages of high specificity and potency 
compared to small molecules. These features arise from their macromolecular nature, which 
provides the structural complexity that is often required for specificity. However, this 
structural complexity also makes them some of the most challenging molecules to formulate 
and deliver. Indeed, the formulation and delivery issues of biopharmaceuticals were 
recognized as major potential liabilities from the earliest days of biotechnology, which 
partly made them less appealing drug candidates. Loss of activity in response to 
environmental triggers such as moisture or temperature, which can occur during storage or 
in the body, puts a substantial burden on formulation technologies. The high molecular mass 
of biopharmaceutical drugs also creates delivery challenges, namely a substantial reduction 
in permeability across biological barriers such as skin, mucosal membranes and cell 
membranes, which means that injection is currently the primary mode of administration. 
Delivery of biopharmaceutical drugs to specific sites — for example, intracellular targets — 
is also challenging owing to their poor membrane permeation3.
In spite of these challenges, novel parenteral formulations and delivery strategies have 
enabled the launch onto the market of numerous successful products, including products 
based on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; also known as GnRH) analogues, 
such as leuprolide depot (Lupron Depot; AbbVie). This suggests that the advantages of 
biopharmaceuticals far exceed their limitations. This Review highlights the recent progress 
and unmet needs in the formulation and delivery of biopharmaceutical drugs. The advances 
reviewed here suggest that biopharmaceutical drugs will have an even greater impact in the 
future if the remaining unmet needs are addressed.
Advanced formulations and chemistry
Intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous injections are currently the most commonly 
used ways of delivering biopharmaceuticals. Subcutaneous injections are the most 
convenient as they require minimal skills and are the least invasive, whereas intramuscular 
injections are commonly used for vaccines. Intravenous injections are generally used for 
biopharmaceutical drugs such as monoclonal antibodies. Regardless of the type of injection, 
many biopharmaceutical drugs (with a few exceptions, such as monoclonal antibodies) are 
rapidly cleared from the body, meaning that frequent injections are required. Several 
strategies have been developed to address this challenge and are summarized below (BOX 
1).
Microparticles
Microparticles are generally used for the long-term delivery (1 week or longer) of proteins, 
peptides and some small molecules, and are generally administered by intramuscular or 
subcutaneous injection (TABLE 1). They control both the level of the drug and its lifetime 
in the body4, and can affect drug pharmacokinetics by enabling sustained release of the Mitragotri et al. Page 2
Nat Rev Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptdrug. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymers are the most common material used for 
the encapsulation of peptides or proteins, as they are mechanically strong, hydrophobic, 
biocompatible and degrade into toxicologically acceptable products that are eliminated from 
the body5. Other potentially useful materials include polyanhydrides6 and cyclodextrins7,8. 
PLGA polymers have been widely used in marketed products — for example, for delivering 
risperidone (Risperdal; Johnson & Johnson) to treat schizophrenia9 and naltrexone for 
treating alcoholism and narcotic addiction10. They have also been used to deliver peptides 
such as LHRH analogues for treating advanced prostate cancer and endometriosis11, 
glucagon-like peptides (GLPs) for treating type 2 diabetes12 and proteins such as human 
growth hormone for treating pituitary dwarfism13 (Supplementary information S1 (table)).
Encapsulation, biocompatibility and protein release from microspheres are closely related to 
their structural properties. For example, the release rates of proteins depend on the 
degradation of the polymer and/or diffusion of the protein from the microsphere, which in 
turn depends on the molecular mass of the polymer and the protein, the lactic/glycolic molar 
ratio, particle size and the loading of proteins within microspheres, as well as microsphere 
size and porosity (FIG. 1). The shape of a particle also influences its behaviour, in particular 
its interactions with macrophages14. Because the diffusional transport of proteins through 
PLGA is limited, the rate of polymer degradation has an important role in the mechanism 
and rate of release of the drug from microspheres. In addition, diffusion of the protein 
through the biological fluid surrounding the microsphere is dependent on the size of the 
protein, and this will affect the rate of absorption after release15.
The most common method of microencapsulating peptides is through the use of solvent 
evaporation, but many other approaches such as atomization methods are also used16. The 
encapsulation of proteins is substantially more challenging, and additional properties of 
proteins must be considered. Proteins can lose their structure and biological activity upon 
prolonged incubation with biological fluids under physiological conditions17. For example, 
aggregation and incomplete release from the microsphere have been observed with growth 
hormones18 and a covalent dimer formed in a microsphere formulation of darbepoetin alfa 
(Aranesp; Amgen)19. In addition, the local degradation of polymers at the injection site can 
lower the pH inside the microsphere, which can further add to the potential for protein 
inactivation20. The addition of magnesium hydroxide and other antacids within the 
microsphere has been shown to negate the adverse effects of low pH21.
Although clear advances have been made in the use of microparticles for delivering 
biopharmaceutical drugs, challenges remain. Specifically, further advances in controlling the 
burst release can increase the duration of drug release. In addition, methods that provide 
active control of the rate of drug release, including on-demand termination of release, could 
open up new opportunities. A reduction in the size of the microsphere (but still within the 
micron scale) could lead to a subsequent reduction in the required needle size for 
administration while maintaining the rate of sustained release. Additional unmet needs 
include the requirement for a robust manufacturing process that can be achieved at a 
reasonable cost, the need for stabilization and sterilization strategies to be broadly applicable 
to many biopharma-ceutical drugs, and a need for preclinical tools and/or models for 
addressing the risk of immunogenicity. In addition, it is important to consider issues such as Mitragotri et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptease of injection — that is, addressing the reconstitution of the lyophilized product and the 
clogging of needles with drugs. Many of these issues are not unique to protein- and peptide-
based drugs, however, but are in fact common to all microsphere-based drugs.
Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles — which are composed of materials such as polymers, lipids and dendrimers 
— have been actively studied as carriers, especially for targeted delivery of small-molecule 
drugs22,23. Indeed, several nanoparticles are currently on the market, including doxorubicin 
liposomes (Doxil; Janssen) for the treatment of ovarian cancer and AIDS-associated 
Kaposi’s sarcoma24,25, and paclitaxel-containing albumin nanoparticles (Abraxane; 
Celgene) for second-line treatment of patients with breast cancer26,27.
There are fewer examples of the use of nanoparticles for delivering proteins and peptides, 
and these agents are in the early stages of development. There are several examples of 
nanoparticle-mediated delivery of small-molecule chemotherapeutic agents at clinical and 
preclinical stages (reviewed in REF. 28). An example of nanoparticle-mediated protein 
delivery that shows promise for clinical application is the delivery of cytokines for tumour 
immunotherapy. Specifically, immunosuppressive factors associated with the tumour 
microenvironment were targeted using a combination of a small-molecule transforming 
growth factor- β (TGF β) inhibitor and the immunostimulant interleukin-2 (IL-2)29. Core-
shell nanoparticles were developed to encapsulate both the water-soluble protein (IL-2) and 
the hydrophobic small-molecule cargo (the TGF β inhibitor) into a single nanoparticle that 
was designed to enable simultaneous release of both drugs. This method led to sustained 
local delivery, thereby reducing the toxicity of IL-2, and the combination therapy delayed 
tumour growth and increased survival in a mouse model of melanoma29.
In another example, which aimed to increase the viability and efficacy of a cell-based 
therapy, sustained pseudoautocrine stimulation was provided to donor cells in a mouse 
model of adaptive T cell cancer therapy by conjugating adjuvant nanoparticles to the T cell 
surface30. The approach mitigates the dose-limiting toxicities that are associated with 
conventional approaches to adjuvant administration. Multilamellar lipid nanoparticles were 
directly conjugated to free thiol groups on the surface of various cell types, including CD8+ 
T cells. Nanoparticle-tethered T cells trafficked to antigen-expressing tumours as effectively 
as their untethered counterparts. When the particles were bound to melanoma-specific T 
cells and injected into mice with established lung and bone marrow metastases, complete 
clearance of the tumour was achieved.
In general, systemically delivered nanoparticles face several physiological barriers before 
reaching their target (FIG. 2). Technological advances for overcoming these hurdles are 
important to enable future success in this field; these include pegylation for prolonging the 
circulation of nanoparticles31 and enhancing tissue penetration32, optimization of particle 
size33 and the use of substances to enhance deep tumour penetration of nanoparticles34.
Although a limited number of studies can be found on the use of nanoparticles for the 
delivery of therapeutic proteins, nanoparticles have been actively used for delivering 
vaccines or as vaccine adjuvants35. The primary advantage of nanoparticulate vaccines is Mitragotri et al. Page 4

Depot injections
Injectable implants of drugs are an alternative to particulate formulations for sustained drug 
release, and have been used for both small and large molecules. Surgically implantable 
depots — that is, formulations that are too large to be injected by needles — have also been 
developed for small molecules (reviewed in REF. 37), such as the chemotherapeutic drug 
bis-chloro-ethylnitrosourea (BCNU). Among biopharmaceutical drugs, an injectable 
formulation of the LHRH agonist goserelin acetate contained in a PLGA rod (Zoladex; 
AstraZeneca) is the most commercially successful example (Supplementary information S1 
(table)). Other polymers such as hyaluronic acid are also being explored for their use in 
depot injections38.
Injectable monoliths can circumvent some of the manufacturing complexities and challenges 
associated with particulate systems, such as the suspension and reconstitution of particulate 
drug formulations. In addition, the lower specific surface area of monoliths can often result 
in a reduced burst release of drugs. The use of additional ingredients such as PEG 400 in the 
formulation has been shown to reduce the initial burst39. Blends of block copolymers and 
PLGA are also effective in offering prolonged release of protein drug. Injectable in situ -
forming depot systems, including those based on injectable solutions of PLGA in sucrose 
acetate isobutyrate40,41 or N-methyl pyrollidone42,43, offer similar potential benefits44.
Reverse thermal gelling systems45 are based on polymers that form solutions at room 
temperature but become gels at body temperature following injection. The in situ -forming 
system PB1023, which is based on a fusion of the drug cargo GLP1 with elastin-like 
polypeptide (ELP), recently completed a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of diabetes46 
(ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT01658501). ELPs undergo a phase transition at body 
temperature to form a depot that leads to sustained release. A single injection of the GLP1–
ELP fusion protein reduced glucose levels for 5 days, which is 120 times longer than with 
GLP1 alone.
Another example of a protein depot injection consists of a conjugate of poly- L-glutamic acid 
and α-tocopherol, which forms non-covalent complexes with proteins and peptides through 
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. This results in the formation of an in vivo  drug 
depot after injection, with sustained drug release over 1–14 days47. Proof of concept of this 
proprietary system was shown for a formulation of IL-2 in patients with renal cell 
carcinoma48, and a formulation of interferon-alpha-2b is currently in clinical trials for the 
treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (Supplementary information S1 (table); 
ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT01010646). Another example of an injectable depot 
technology consists of a solution of naturally occurring polar lipids that self-assemble into 
reversed liquid crystal phases when injected into the body (known as FluidCrystal® 
injection depots)49. This system has been used for sustained delivery of proteins and 
peptides, such as leuprolide acetate (CAM2032) and octreotide (CAM2029; orphan 
designation EU/3/09/645), which are under clinical evaluation for prostate cancer and Mitragotri et al. Page 5

The emergence of biosimilars and the availability of analytical technologies with increased 
sensitivity for the detection of degradation products have resulted in increasingly high 
standards for the analytical purity of conventional protein formulations, and recognition 
from the scientific community that these higher standards also need to be applied to 
sustained-release protein formulations50.
Although the stresses imposed on protein drugs through the fabrication, storage and 
administration of sustained-release formulations have been long appreciated, a better 
understanding of the molecular basis of protein degradation and aggregation pathways could 
potentially lead to new stabilization approaches or the design of new delivery systems that 
are more suited to labile macromolecules. Recent examples include a dendritic polyglycerol 
nanogel system that was used to encapsulate asparaginase under surfactant-free conditions 
using hydrophilic components51. A pH-sensitive benzacetal crosslinking agent enabled the 
triggered release of payload under acidic conditions with almost 100% recovery of 
enzymatic activity compared to a control. Asparaginase that was recovered at the end of 
matrix degradation after 7 days had the same activity as a control, and its secondary 
structure was unchanged.
In another example, an alginate depot formulation of a fully humanized immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) monoclonal antibody was developed to exploit the electrostatic interactions that 
occur between the protein and the polyanionic gel matrix to enable local sustained 
delivery52,53. The system was designed to provide a stable pH environment and to avoid 
protein aggregation at a high payload concentration. In vitro  analysis showed 90–100% 
recovery of intact IgG1, with monomer content >94%. Preliminary evaluation of IgG1 
release over 28 days in rats showed that bioavailability was comparable to that observed 
with a conventional solution formulation.
Most depot formulation technologies, as well as the particle technologies discussed above, 
rely on non-covalent association between the drug and the matrix. Thus, their 
implementation does not require the creation of a new molecular entity. This could 
potentially simplify their development owing to the applicability of analytical methods that 
were developed for conventional formulations of the same drug, as well as preclinical 
pharmacology and safety data generated with those formulations.
Injectable modified peptides and proteins
Most macromolecules that are smaller than ~ 60 kDa are cleared from the body via renal 
filtration54. Attempts have been made to reduce renal clearance by increasing the size of 
macromolecules or by making modifications to the macromolecule based on known 
biological phenomena in order to reduce renal clearance and, consequently, injection 
frequency (FIG. 3).Mitragotri et al. Page 6
Nat Rev Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptTypes of protein modifications
Chemical modification with hydrophilic polymers can increase the hydrodynamic radius 
such that glomerular filtration is reduced or eliminated, thus extending the circulating half-
life to a commercially attractive range55. There are many examples of pegylated drugs on 
the market, and alternatives to polyethylene glycol (PEG) — such as sialic acid56, as well as 
the naturally occurring polysaccharides hyaluronic acid57 and hydroxyl ethyl starch54 — are 
currently under preclinical and clinical investigation (Supplementary information S1 
(table)).
Approaches that exploit the neonatal Fc receptor recycling (FcRn recycling) pathway have 
also been developed to increase the half-life of macromolecules (FIG. 4). This approach, 
which involves the creation of genetic fusions between the macromolecule and the Fc region 
of IgG, has resulted in many approved products, including the blockbuster etanercept 
(Enbrel; Amgen) and several candidates that are currently in advanced stages of clinical 
development (Supplementary information S1 (table)).
Efforts have also been made to extend circulation times by exploiting the favourable 
circulating half-life of albumin58, thus enabling weekly dosing. For example, an albumin 
fusion of GLP1(7–36) (albiglutide; ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT01098539)59 was 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2014 for the 
improvement of glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, and an albumin fusion of 
factor IX60 is in Phase III clinical evaluation for the prevention of bleeding episodes in 
children and adults with severe haemophilia B ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: 
NCT02053792). In addition, an albumin fusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-
CSF), neugranin, is under development for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced 
neutropenia ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT00837265). A fusion of albumin with two 
different single-chain variable fragments (scFv fragments), which bind to HER2 and HER3, 
has been created to form a single-polypeptide-chain bispecific antibody61 that is in Phase II 
clinical trials for the treatment of certain types of oesophageal cancer (MM-111; 
ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT01774851). A related approach, which uses chemical 
conjugation of albumin with a synthetic peptide, has been applied to exendin-4; the 
conjugate (known as CJC-1134-PC) is under clinical evaluation for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes (Supplementary information S1 (table); ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: 
NCT01514149).
Advantages and disadvantages of protein modification
Although pegylation can decrease protein immunogenicity and increase solubility, the 
principal benefit of this modification is the ability to reduce the frequency of dosing owing 
to the longer circulating half-life of the drug. The approach provides sustained — but not 
controlled — exposure; clearance from the body is still exponential, and so a longer duration 
of exposure can only be attained by increasing the dose. For compounds with large 
therapeutic indices (which is typical for many biopharmaceutical drugs), the cost of goods 
and/or dosing volumes needed for a longer duration of action can become limiting. 
Alternative approaches may be required for molecules with toxicities that are related to peak 
exposure. Moreover, pegylation can negatively influence the binding of a molecule to its Mitragotri et al. Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcognate receptor owing to steric hindrance; however, optimal design of molecules can 
minimize this effect, and pharmacokinetic benefits can render it inconsequential.
Reactions of the immune system to non-native conjugates or fusion structures pose a 
potential safety issue. In the case of fusions with native human proteins, cross-reactivity 
with endogenous homologues could pose a long-term safety threat in addition to potentially 
altering the clearance of subsequent doses. However, for many Fc-or albumin-fusion 
products this risk has not proven to be detrimental (Supplementary information S1 (table)). 
Fusions of recombinant factor VIII62 and factor IX63, which are currently in advanced 
development for the treatment of haemophilia ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifiers: NCT02093897 
and NCT02053792, respectively; Supplementary information S1 (table)), are intended for 
chronic lifelong use, and as such their approval could be an important new milestone in 
establishing the safety of fusion approaches. The immunogenicity of fusion proteins, 
however, is an ongoing concern. Many of the approved Fc-fusion drugs (Supplementary 
information S1 (table)), such as etanercept, which is approved for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, are themselves immunosuppressive therapies, whereas 
others, such as aflibercept (Zaltrap; Regeneron), which is approved for the treatment of 
metastatic colorectal cancer, have been used for indications where patients’ immune systems 
are not functioning normally. As a result, effects related to immunogenicity are possibly 
obscured. The bar for the safety for clotting factors is likely to be higher. Importantly, the 
Phase III study for a factor IX–Fc fusion protein reported no evidence of immunogenicity63, 
and the FDA approved this product in March 2014.
New developments in protein modification
Early approaches to conjugation (reviewed in REF. 55) illustrated the potential to affect 
properties such as potency and pharmacokinetics55. More recent advances in long-
circulating biopharmaceutical polymer conjugates have increased the precision with which 
conjugates are defined at a molecular level, either through polymer chemistry or through 
site-specific conjugation. At its most advanced stage, conjugate research applies the tools of 
medicinal chemistry by incorporating insights from structure–function studies into the 
design of the molecule. A study64 of the site-specific pegylated WW domain of the human 
protein peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans  isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1)65 showed that 
conformational stability depends on the molecular mass of PEG; longer oligomers increased 
the folding rate and reduced the rate of protein unfolding.
Pegylated proteins are generally considered to have reduced immunogenicity compared to 
their unmodified equivalents, and one of the earliest pegylated products, pegademase 
bovine, exploited the ability of PEG to mitigate the immunogenicity of a bovine enzyme for 
use as a biopharmaceutical. Nevertheless, the formation of antibodies against PEG itself has 
recently gained attention; PEG end-group chemistry (that is, the substituent at the end of the 
PEG molecule) is reported to have a substantial role in determining immunogenicity. The 
use of hydroxyl-PEG, as opposed to the widely used methoxy-PEG, may offer a safety 
advantage under some circumstances66,67. These types of insights could lead to the future 
development of biopharmaceutical conjugates with superior properties. Reversible 
pegylation has been explored as a way of mitigating the reduction in potency induced by Mitragotri et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptconjugation and achieving greater control of drug concentration over time68. The creation of 
PEG prodrugs that are minimally or partially active could potentially make it possible to 
administer higher doses — and thus achieve a longer duration of action — of compounds 
that have toxicities related to C max in their fully active form.
Alternatives to PEG that could offer improvements in chemical definition, biocompatibility 
or manufacturability have been explored. Among the most advanced are polymers that are 
based on poly(2-oxazoline). These are synthesized by a technique known as living 
polymerization, which allows for good control of the molecular definition; hydrophobicity 
can be tuned according to the composition of the side chains. Amphiphilic block copolymers 
of poly(2-oxazoline) have been shown to increase the uptake of conjugated macromolecules 
into cells69.
Alternative approaches to protein modification based on genetic engineering
Lessons learned from the success of pegylation and Fc-fusion-based products have helped 
guide the application of genetic engineering tools to improve the delivery of 
biopharmaceuticals. The most commercially successful example, darbepoetin alfa, is a 
variant of erythropoietin that is genetically engineered to include two additional sialic acid 
chains70. Introducing non-structured polyamino acid tails on the amino and/or carboxy 
termini of several therapeutic proteins achieved a PEG-like effect on the hydrodynamic 
radius and on renal clearance by glomerular filtration71. The approach has been used in 
several development programmes (Supplementary information S1 (table)), including in 
clinical studies of VRS-859, a GLP1 analogue72, and of VRS-371 ( ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier: NCT01359488), a long-acting human growth hormone. Native human growth 
hormone is cleared by glomerular filtration as well as receptor-mediated clearance in the 
kidney. VRS-371 was designed to have reduced receptor binding, and so it undergoes less 
receptor-mediated clearance in the kidney73. Based on a Phase I clinical trial in adults with 
growth hormone deficiency, it is anticipated that VRS-371 can be dosed monthly74, which 
will be a milestone for a technology that does not involve FcRn recycling. However, the 
immunogenicity of VRS-371 has yet to be fully assessed.
Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to try to control the half-lives of Fc- and albumin-
fusion products by optimizing the binding affinity of the molecule to FcRn. Half-lives for 
ten marketed antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins were reported to range from 4 to 23 days, 
depending on the Kd value for FcRn binding75,76. Mutants of an anti-human B cell surface 
receptor antibody with improved FcRn binding affinity had an impact on pharmacokinetics 
in primates (although the relationship between FcRn affinity and the level of improvement 
in pharmacokinetic properties was not directly proportional)77. The relationship between 
FcRn binding affinity and half-life has informed recent efforts to map the albumin FcRn 
binding domain78, with a view towards the design of albumin fusions that have a wider 
range of half-lives than can be achieved with native human albumin domains79.
Devices
In spite of their widespread use in biopharmaceutical drug delivery, injectable 
biopharmaceutical drugs have several limitations, including the creation of needle phobia in Mitragotri et al. Page 9
Nat Rev Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptpatients, accidental injuries and improper use80. Needle-based autoinjectors are in clinical 
use; although they are simple to use and avoid visual appearance of the needle, the insertion 
of a needle is still associated with pain. Accordingly, although needles have undergone 
substantial improvements over the years, the development of better alternatives to needle-
based injections has been a high priority for research and development.
Implantable, patch and microfluidic pumps
Implantable pumps are commercially available to deliver biopharmaceutical drugs, 
especially insulin81,82. Compared to multiple daily injections, the use of implantable insulin 
pumps improves glycaemic control83. Insulin patch pumps address the limitations of 
implantable pumps as they are lightweight and can be worn discreetly on the skin84. Newer, 
microtechnology-based implantable pumps have also been developed to achieve more 
precise control over delivery and have been used to deliver human parathyroid hormone 
fragments in clinical studies85,86. Although currently available pumps have enabled the 
delivery of insulin, challenges remain. Specifically, the implantation of pumps is invasive 
and they require frequent refilling with the drug. Moreover, patch pumps have limited 
longevity owing to the limited duration of the sterility of the skin. The ultimate goal of an 
insulin pump is to develop a closed-loop device that offers automated control of blood 
glucose levels. Robust algorithms that utilize the output of an implanted glucose sensor to 
determine requisite doses have been developed87 and are in clinical trials ( ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifiers: NCT01271023, NCT01472406).
Needle-free injectors
Liquid jet injections offer several advantages, including the ability to use currently approved 
injectable formulations — which will greatly facilitate clinical adoption — as well as the 
ability to work without electronics and the provision of small portable devices. Liquid jet 
injectors have been used for mass immunization programmes against infectious diseases, as 
well as for the delivery of insulin and growth hormones88,89. However, the acceptance of 
liquid jet injectors has been low owing to occasional pain and bleeding at the site of 
injection90. Therefore, efforts are underway to improve the jet injection process, such as the 
use of pulsed microjets91, variable velocity injectors92 and feedback-controlled injectors93. 
Although needle-free liquid injectors are the only currently available, broadly applicable, 
needle-free approach for protein delivery, they have not had a strong impact on the field. 
Future research must focus on addressing the variability in the amount of drug that is 
delivered via injection, which originates in part from the variation in skin properties among 
patients, as well as within different regions of the body. In addition, the devices must be 
designed so they are inexpensive and sufficiently simple to use.
Alternative routes of drug delivery
Owing to the limitations of injections, alternative delivery routes — including pulmonary94, 
nasal95, oral96, transdermal97,98, vaginal and ocular delivery of biopharmaceutical drugs — 
have been explored to increase patient compliance (FIG. 5). Each route offers its own 
unique advantages and limitations (TABLE 1). However, the delivery of bio-pharmaceutical 
drugs through these alternative routes is limited by the associated biological barriers, the Mitragotri et al. Page 10
Nat Rev Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptbiophysical properties of which are reviewed in REFS 99, 100. Nevertheless, device- or 
formulation-based approaches have been developed to overcome these barriers.
Pulmonary delivery
To date, most research on the delivery of aerosol formulations has focused on the delivery of 
small molecules to the lung itself, and has addressed issues such as aggregation of drug 
particles and decreasing the clearance of drugs by macrophages94. Nevertheless, the delivery 
of protein drugs though the pulmonary route has been achieved. Inhaled insulin101 received 
FDA approval in 2006; however, it was discontinued in 2007 owing in part to high costs as 
well as poor patient uptake of the bulky device. Recent studies have shown that a more 
compact device can effectively deliver insulin by inhalation in patients with type 2 
diabetes102, and the product has recently received regulatory approval (see the 27 Jun 2014 
press release on the MannKind Corporation website). Although advances have been made in 
the field of pulmonary delivery, unmet needs remain; these include potential safety issues, 
the limited delivery efficiency associated with inhaled proteins and the ease of use of the 
product, as well as potentially the relatively short duration of action, as the same 
physiological factors that enable the drug to have a quick onset of action also make 
sustained delivery challenging.
Transdermal administration
Transdermal patches offer a painless alternative to injections; however, their applications are 
generally limited to low-molecular-mass hydrophobic drugs. An in-depth review of 
transdermal drug delivery can be found in REF. 103. Several methods have been developed 
to temporarily disrupt the skin structure to deliver macromolecular drugs, including the use 
of peptides such as TD-1 (REF. 104), SPACE (skin-permeating and cell-entering) 
peptides105 and cell-penetrating peptides such as polyarginine106. TD-1 and SPACE 
peptides were discovered specifically to penetrate skin using in vivo  phage display and 
effectively delivered large molecules such as insulin104 and hyaluronic acid107 into mice. 
Several chemical-based formulation strategies108 have also been developed to enhance 
transdermal drug delivery; however, their clinical applications are generally limited to small 
molecules.
Devices that are based on the use of ultrasound, electric fields or microneedles have been 
particularly effective in increasing the permeability of the skin109. Ultrasound and electric-
field-based methods such as iontophoresis and electroporation have been used to deliver 
biopharmaceutical drugs — including insulin110,111 and parathyroid hormone112 — in 
animal models. Neither method is currently used in the clinic for large molecules, but 
ultrasound and iontophoresis have been approved by the FDA for the delivery of small 
molecules in a clinical setting113. Microneedles can penetrate into skin as far as the 
epidermis and thereby enhance drug penetration without causing pain. Microneedles have 
successfully delivered insulin, vaccines and parathyroid hormone in clinical studies98, and 
are proving to be particularly appealing for the delivery of vaccines as they have been shown 
to induce immune responses that are comparable to or better than intramuscular injections in 
mouse models114,115. Microneedles are also being developed for the systemic delivery of 
parathyroid hormone and are in clinical studies of parathyroid hormone-related protein Mitragotri et al. Page 11

NCT01684956), as well as vaccines of inactivated polio virus ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: 
NCT01686503) and influenza ( ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier: NCT01368796).
Collectively, the technologies described above have enabled progress in the transdermal 
delivery of proteins over the past two decades. There are several future challenges in this 
field; the complexity of the devices, including the size and required expertise, can make 
their adoption challenging, and so the device-based methods must be simple to use. At the 
same time, the bioavailability of the drug must be sufficiently high to make the technology 
economically feasible. Finally, the variability of drug delivery must be sufficiently reduced 
to allow the administration of drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window.
Oral delivery
Oral delivery offers increased patient acceptance, but the oral delivery of macromolecules is 
limited by enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and limited permeation across 
the intestinal epithelium116. In addition, the mucus layer on the epithelium provides a barrier 
for the diffusion of macromolecules. These limitations lead to poor drug absorption into 
systemic circulation and insignificant bioavailability of macromolecules.
Several absorption enhancers, including fatty acids, surfactants and bile salts, have been 
tested for their ability to improve the oral delivery of macromolecules117 in animal models. 
Sodium caprate enhances the delivery of macromolecules such as oligonucleotides and low-
molecular-weight heparin118 in animal models and humans. Another absorption enhancer is 
tetradecylmaltoside, which also enhances the uptake of low-molecular-weight heparin119. 
The screening of a large library of chemicals and chemical mixtures to identify compositions 
that enhance the uptake of peptides and proteins120 led to the identification of the 
zwitterionic surfactant dimethyl palmitoyl ammonio propanesulphonate (PPS), which 
enhanced the intestinal permeation of calcitonin in mice121. Other methods of increasing 
absorption include pH-sensitive hydrogels to protect the drug from low pH in the 
stomach122, chitosans123 and chitosan derivatives124 to induce mucoadhesion of the drug 
carrier and increase intestinal permeation, and acrylate-based polymers to increase 
mucoadhesion125.
Device-based approaches are also being actively pursued for oral drug delivery. 
Mucoadhesive devices that mimic the structure of skin patches have been tested for the oral 
delivery of insulin and calcitonin in rodent models96,126. These devices continue to be 
researched and developed127, but have yet to be tested in humans. The current design of 
these mucoadhesive devices is based on layered structures that comprise a mucoadhesive 
layer that attaches and retains the device on the mucus, a drug layer, and a backing layer that 
prevents diffusion of the drug back into the lumen and entry of gastrointestinal enzymes into 
the patch. This design creates a depot of high-concentration drug on the surface of the 
intestine, which enhances the concentration gradient across the intestine and increases oral 
drug bioavailability.
The use of nanoparticles, which are absorbed across the intestinal epithelium, has also been 
explored for the oral delivery of biopharmaceuticals. The uptake, which can be mediated by Mitragotri et al. Page 12
Nat Rev Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptPeyer’s patches, M cells and enterocytes, depends on several parameters, including the size 
and surface chemistry of nanoparticles. Although unmodified particles are known to 
permeate the epithelium, targeted nanoparticles further enhance uptake. In this regard, 
several targeting ligands — including lectin, the M cell-targeted monoclonal antibody and 
the Fc region of antibodies128 — have been explored for the oral uptake of nanoparticles in 
mice. Further testing of such novel technologies in larger animal models is necessary to 
understand their clinical potential.
The ability of penetration enhancers, nanoparticles and mucoadhesive devices to deliver 
insulin, calcitonin and other biopharmaceutical drugs has been established in small 
animals118,129,130. Oral delivery of proteins and peptides, however, has had limited clinical 
success. Clinical studies have shown oral delivery of salmon calcitonin using the permeation 
enhancer 5-CNAC131 but the clinical programme was terminated owing to lack of efficacy 
in Phase III clinical trials (see the 14 Dec 2011 press release on the Emisphere website). 
Permeation enhancers from the same family have also been shown to enhance the oral 
uptake of heparin in humans132. Another enhancer, sodium caprate, has been shown to 
increase the delivery of oligonucleotides in humans133 and of low-molecular-weight heparin 
in rats118. Advances have also been made using other medium-chain fatty acids as enhancers 
to enable the oral delivery of peptides, especially octreotide134.
Another technology that is based on the use of protease inhibitors and an absorption 
enhancer has been tested in humans for the delivery of insulin135. Orally delivered insulin 
reduced the frequency of high glucose readings (>200 mg per dl) when compared to control. 
The same technology has also been tested in humans for delivery of the GLP1 analogue 
exenatide136. Orally delivered exenatide increased peak plasma insulin levels by 28% in 
healthy individuals. A technology based on the use of citric acid (which has proteolysis-
inhibiting properties)137 has also been tested for the oral delivery of salmon calcitonin for 
the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women; oral calcitonin improved lumbar 
spine bone mineral density by about threefold compared to placebo138.
In spite of substantial research over the past two decades, the goal of oral protein delivery 
remains difficult. Limited bioavailability and variability in absorption remain general 
challenges in the field. The appeal of oral protein delivery, however, has not diminished. 
Future research must focus on enhancing bioavailability to economically feasible levels, 
which will be different for each drug. In addition, issues related to the variability in 
absorption and interference from food must be addressed. Other delivery routes that are not 
discussed in this Review include the buccal, nasal, vaginal and ocular routes139–144.
Targeted and intracellular delivery
Although the focus of biopharmaceutical delivery has largely been on systemic delivery, 
targeted and intracellular delivery are important goals (FIG. 6). The local delivery of 
conventional formulations is the simplest option for targeting specific tissues — for 
example, the intravitreally administered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
inhibitors bevacizumab (Avastin; Roche/Genentech), ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech/
Novartis) and aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron) for the treatment of neovascular age-related Mitragotri et al. Page 13
Nat Rev Drug Discov . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 September 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptmacular degeneration. Controlled-release depot formulations provide more consistent local 
exposure, which is important for the delivery of growth factors for tissue engineering (BOX 
2).
The active targeting of biopharmaceuticals to specific tissues following systemic 
administration using ligands of, or antibodies against, cell surface receptors is an attractive 
concept. Recent advances with antibody–drug conjugates145 and a small-molecule 
nanoparticle formulation of docetaxel22 enabled preferential delivery of cytotoxic agents to 
cancerous tissue; this could potentially increase the therapeutic index and enhance the 
efficacy of such cytotoxic drugs. The extension of this approach to the delivery of 
macromolecular cargo is, however, in the early stages of development.
Interest in the intracellular delivery of biopharmaceutical drugs in part originates from 
recent advances in RNA interference (RNAi), where small interfering RNA (siRNA) must 
overcome the cellular barrier to access the RNAi machinery; these advances have focused 
attention on the potential opportunity for developing protein and peptide drugs against 
intracellular targets. Several technologies have been developed to deliver siRNA to the 
skin105,146, liver147, brain148 and tumours149, as well as other tissues. siRNA delivery 
technologies are not discussed here; see REF. 150 for an overview of the field.
Targeted delivery to the brain
The blood–brain barrier poses a unique challenge for the targeted delivery of 
biopharmaceuticals to the brain (FIG. 7). Nevertheless, there has been growing interest in 
this area, which has been fuelled in part by the therapeutic promise seen in the peripheral 
administration of antibodies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Antibodies are 
attractive owing to their high specificity and reduced off-target effects, and peripherally 
administered monoclonal antibodies result in measurable, albeit low, central nervous system 
(CNS) exposure151 that probably results from a nonspecific mechanism of uptake across the 
blood– brain barrier. For example, systemically circulating IgG levels in the CNS are 0.1% 
of their levels in plasma152. Neurodegenerative disease is an area of particular focus, in part 
owing to the difficulty of developing CNS-penetrant, specific, small-molecule therapeutics. 
An antibody inhibitor of β-secretase, the enzyme that processes amyloid precursor protein 
(APP), reduced peripheral and CNS amyloid- β concentrations in mice and in non-human 
primates153 following systemic administration. An antibody against α-synuclein, which 
accumula",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to address the challenges in targeted delivery of biopharmaceuticals to the brain.,"Research Hypothesis:
The use of targeted delivery strategies, such as the development of antibody–drug conjugates and small-molecule nanoparticle formulations, will enable preferential delivery of cytotoxic agents to specific tissues, thereby increasing the therapeutic index and enhancing the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs.

Research Proposal:
This study aims to investigate the potential of targeted delivery strategies for improving the therapeutic index and efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. The research will focus on developing and testing antibody–drug conjugates and small-molecule nanoparticle formulations for preferential delivery of cytotoxic agents to cancerous tissues. The study will involve in vitro and in vivo experiments to assess the specificity, efficacy, and safety of these targeted delivery strategies. The findings from this research will contribute to the development of novel approaches for improving the delivery of cytotoxic drugs and may have implications for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer."

AbstractT cells directed against mutant neo-epitopes drive cancer immunity. However, spontaneous immune recognition of mutations is inefficient. We recently introduced the concept of individualized mutanome vaccines and implemented an RNA-based poly-neo-epitope approach to mobilize immunity against a spectrum of cancer mutations1,2. Here we report the first-in-human application of this concept in melanoma. We set up a process comprising comprehensive identification of individual mutations, computational prediction of neo-epitopes, and design and manufacturing of a vaccine unique for each patient. All patients developed T cell responses against multiple vaccine neo-epitopes at up to high single-digit percentages. Vaccine-induced T cell infiltration and neo-epitope-specific killing of autologous tumour cells were shown in post-vaccination resected metastases from two patients. The cumulative rate of metastatic events was highly significantly reduced after the start of vaccination, resulting in a sustained progression-free survival. Two of the five patients with metastatic disease experienced vaccine-related objective responses. One of these patients had a late relapse owing to outgrowth of β2-microglobulin-deficient melanoma cells as an acquired resistance mechanism. A third patient developed a complete response to vaccination in combination with PD-1 blockade therapy. Our study demonstrates that individual mutations can be exploited, thereby opening a path to personalized immunotherapy for patients with cancer.

Editorial SummaryPersonalized cancer vaccine trialsNeoantigens have long been considered optimal targets for anti-tumour vaccines, and recent mutation coding and prediction techniques have aimed to streamline their identification and selection. Two papers in this issue report results from personalized neoantigen vaccine trials in patients with cancer. Catherine Wu and colleagues report the results of a phase I trial of a personalized cancer vaccine that targets up to 20 patient neoantigens. The vaccine was safe and induced tumour-antigen-specific immune responses. Four out of six patients treated showed no recurrence at 25 months, and progressing patients responded to further therapy with checkpoint inhibitor. Ugur Sahin and colleagues report the first-in-human application of a personalized neoantigen vaccine in patients with melanoma. Their vaccination strategy includes sequencing and computational identification of neoantigens from patients, and design and manufacture of a poly-antigen RNA vaccine for treatment. In 13 patients, the vaccine boosted immunity against some of the selected tumour antigens from the individual patients, and two patients showed infiltration of tumour-reactive T cells. These results suggest that personalized vaccines could be refined and tailored to provide clinical benefit as cancer immunotherapies.show all

Sign up for Nature Briefing: Translational Research",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the efficacy of personalized neoantigen vaccines in a larger cohort of patients with melanoma.,"Based on the research goal of proposing a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the efficacy of personalized neoantigen vaccines in a larger cohort of patients with melanoma, the initial research hypothesis and proposal could be:

Research Hypothesis: Personalized neoantigen vaccines will elicit a robust and specific immune response in patients with melanoma, leading to improved tumor control and prolonged progression-free survival.

Research Proposal: To test the hypothesis, a clinical trial will be conducted to administer personalized neoantigen vaccines to a larger cohort of patients with melanoma. The study will involve comprehensive identification of individual mutations, computational prediction of neo-epitopes, and design and manufacturing of a vaccine unique for each patient. The efficacy of the vaccine will be evaluated by assessing T cell responses, tumor infiltration, and progression-free survival in the vaccinated patients compared to a control group. Additionally, the study will investigate the potential for combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors to enhance the therapeutic effect of the personalized neoantigen vaccines."

Key Points
Antibody therapeutics have become an important new drug class, with 17 antibodies now marketed for therapeutic use in the United States across diverse clinical settings: oncology, chronic inflammatory diseases, transplantation, infectious diseases and cardiovascular medicine.
Three powerful factors are converging to support the emergence of antibody therapeutics that are more potent and effective: a clinical imperative to achieve a better outcome for patients; the availability of established and emerging technologies to improve antibody performance; and the commercial drive to compete. Increased competition is inevitable, because many approved antibody drugs and antibody drugs under investigation target the same antigen and clinical indications.
Antibodies have numerous interdependent properties that can be tuned to improve their clinical potential. These include immunogenicity, antigen-binding specificity and affinity, effector functions and other biological activities, pharmacokinetics, molecular architecture, internalization after cell binding, and biophysical characteristics. Several of these properties can be modulated by engineering the interaction between IgG and one of its binding partners: that is, target antigen, IgG receptors (FcγRs), complement component 1q (C1q) and the salvage receptor FcRn.
Antibodies are commonly optimized by selection from genetically diverse display libraries of antibody-fragment variants. Alternatively, they can be optimized by structure-based design followed by expression, purification and functional characterization of individual variants. These selection and design strategies are complementary and are particularly powerful when used in combination.
The first major success in the design of antibodies for therapy was the advent of chimerization and humanization to address immunogenicity and other limitations of mouse monoclonal antibodies. Numerous high-potency humanized and human antibodies are now in preclinical and clinical development.
AbstractAntibodies constitute the most rapidly growing class of human therapeutics and the second largest class of drugs after vaccines. The generation of potent antibody therapeutics, which I review here, is an iterative design process that involves the generation and optimization of antibodies to improve their clinical potential.

Abstract
Theoretical analyses of targeting agent pharmacokinetics provides specific guidance with respect
to desirable design objectives such as agent size, affinity, and target antigen. These analyses
suggest that IgG-sized macromolecular constructs exhibit the most favorable balance between
systemic clearance and vascular extravasation, resulting in maximal tumor uptake. Quantitative
predictions of the effects of dose and binding affinity on tumor uptake and penetration are also
provided. The single bolus dose required for saturation of xenografted tumors in mice can be
predicted from knowledge of antigen expression level and metabolic half-life. The role of high
binding affinity in tumor uptake can be summarized as: essential for small peptides, less important
for antibodies, and negligible for nanoparticles.
1. Introduction
A powerful molecular toolbox is available to vary the size and binding affinity of tumor-
targeting agents essentially at will. Such agents can vary in size from small peptidic
scaffolds just a few nanometers across to nanoparticles hundreds of nanometers in diameter,
and directed evolution can be used to engineer extremely tight binding to tumor-specific
antigens. This impressive raw capability raises important questions with regard to the design
criteria for a tumor-targeting agent. How does size variation affect the delivery of a drug
payload to and throughout a tumor? Can ligand targeting alter nanoparticle biodistribution?
How does binding affinity affect overall biodistribution and penetration throughout the
tumor volume? What dosage is necessary to obtain uniform penetration of an antibody
throughout a tumor? Recently completed analyses of the key rate processes and the
quantitative balances among them in macromolecular pharmacokinetics lead to several
recommendations and quantitative predictions.
2. What Molecular Size Is Best for Tumor Uptake?
We recently utilized a compartmental model to quantitatively analyze the effect of size on
tumor uptake, using previously published data correlating macromolecular size with the key
transport parameters (vascular permeability coefficient and the half-life for systemic
clearance; Schmidt and Wittrup, 2009). The trend in tumor uptake with increasing size is
shown in Fig. 10.1.
A local optimum in tumor uptake is predicted for targeting agents approximately the size of
an IgG immunoglobulin. (It should be noted that this prediction accounts only for the effect

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptof passive clearance (e.g., renal); in fact, FcRn-mediated lifetime extension substantially
further improves tumor uptake for antibodies.) Mathematically, an optimum such as this
results from the balance between two opposing trends. The crux of the behavior is a trade-
off between systemic clearance and extravasation. It has been shown experimentally that the
vascular extravasation rate drops precipitously with increasing macromolecular size (Dreher
et al., 2006)—however, this unfavorable effect is partially compensated for by the benefit of
extended systemic circulation due to decreased renal filtration. It is remarkable to note that
of the wide range of targeting agent sizes created by genetic and materials engineers,
spanning two orders of magnitude, the best size for tumor uptake is in the range that natural
selection already converged to for the primary targeting agents of the humoral immune
system.
Antibody fragments such as scFvs reside in an apparent “death valley” for uptake versus
size. This prediction dovetails with the widespread experimental observation that scFvs and
Fabs deliver relatively anemic tumor localization by comparison to whole antibodies. It has
often been wishfully proposed that the several fold smaller size of antibody fragments might
provide advantageous extravasation and intratumoral penetration characteristics. However,
the rapid renal clearance of these small proteins collapses the circulating concentration too
rapidly to reap the benefits of their favorable transport parameters (Thurber et al., 2007).
Consequently, scFvs, Fabs, diabodies, and the like essentially inhabit the worst of both
worlds: too large for sufficiently rapid extravasation and too small to escape renal clearance.
Interestingly, agents with hydrodynamic diameters <5nm are predicted to exhibit increased
improvements in tumor uptake with further reductions in molecular size. This is because in
this size range, renal clearance is essentially first-pass and so there is little incremental cost
to further shrinkage in size. However, the extravasation rate rises rapidly with decreasing
size, and so even if the tumor-targeting agent only circulates once through the bloodstream
before being renally cleared, more agent is taken up into the tumor as size decreases.
Experimental evidence for the benefits of decreasing size in this range have been provided
for tumor-targeted scaffold proteins of the affibody (Orlova et al., 2006) and DARPin
(Zahnd et al., 2010) types. However, binding scaffolds in this size range are occasionally
pushed into the trough of the curve in Fig. 10.1 by fusion to additional binding domains,
thereby obviating the key advantage of their small size.
Plückthun and coworkers’ elegant and systematic study of the effect of size on DARPin
uptake into tumors directly confirms the minimum in tumor uptake with respect to size
shown in Fig. 10.1. A picomolar affinity anti-HER2 DARPin accumulated in xenografted
mouse tumors to 8.1% ID/g at 24h. However, a larger heterodimer of this DARPin with a
nonbinding DARPin accumulated to only 1.8% ID/g. Further increasing the size by addition
of 20kDa PEG to a DARPin monomer raises the 24-h accumulation to 13% ID/g. Each of
these three constructs had a single identical binding domain attached to varying amounts of
additional macromolecular mass, allowing the effect of size alone to be determined. Tumor
accumulation was therefore experimentally demonstrated to go through a minimum with
respect to size, as predicted by the compartmental model (Fig. 10.1).
The overall recommendation arising from this analysis is that a tumor-targeting agent the
size of an antibody, or slightly larger, should accumulate within tumors to the greatest
extent. It is noteworthy that tumor uptake is predicted to continually decrease as a
consequence of decreased extravasation as size increases above 20nm in radius—a
significant dilemma for nanomedicine.Wittrup et al. Page 2
Methods Enzymol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptAs an approximate prediction of the effects of size on tumor uptake, a relationship can be
derived from the compartmental model of Schmidt and Wittrup (2009), for the high-affinity
limit (Kd →0). This relationship is as follows:
where [Ab] tumor  is the antibody concentration in the tumor, [Ab] plasma,t = 0 is the initial peak
antibody concentration in the plasma, 
  is the permeability coefficient times the
vascular surface to tumor volume ratio ( Rcap is the capillary radius; RKrogh  is the radius of
the cylinder of tissue supplied by the capillary), kclear is the effective first-order systemic
clearance rate constant, and ke is the rate constant for endocytic turnover of the tumor
surface-bound antibody. To estimate the predicted effect of size variation on systemic
clearance in the mouse, the following sigmoidal curve fit to published pharmacokinetic data
can be used (Schmidt and Wittrup, 2009):
where kclear is the clearance rate constant in units of h−1, and R is the hydrodynamic radius
of the targeting agent, in units of nm.
In the absence of a specific measurement of the metabolic half-life for surface-bound
antibody, a reasonable approximation (Mattes et al., 1994; Schmidt et al., 2008) would be to
use a constitutive half-life of 12h, providing ke=0.06h−1.
An estimate of the dependence of the vascular permeability coefficient on size can be
obtained from the following curve fit to published data, assuming a capillary radius of 8µm
and RKrogh  = 75µm (Dreher et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 1994, 1995):
in the range 1nm< R<100nm, with 
  in units of h−1.
These relationships can be used to obtain a rough approximation of the expected tumor
uptake time trajectory of a given targeting agent as a function of its size.
3. Will Targeting Increase Nanoparticle Accumulation in a Tumor?
It is a common strategy to add targeting ligands to the surface of nanoparticles, with the
expressed intention of increasing tumor uptake. It is an unfortunate fact however that this
approach does not succeed in that objective for agents 100nm in diameter or larger. This is
because the loss of unbound nanoparticles from the tumor by intravasation is slower than
constitutive internalization and consumption of nanoparticles within the tumor interstitium
(Schmidt and Wittrup, 2009). There are nevertheless benefits to attaching ligands to
nanoparticles, as tumor cell endocytic uptake effectively delivers nanoparticle payloads.Wittrup et al. Page 3
Methods Enzymol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe impact (or lack thereof) of molecular targeting on biodistribution is only discernable
when negative, nontargeted controls are included in studies. A survey of such biodistribution
studies of targeted and untargeted nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 10.2. There is, in general,
an insignificant difference in tumor uptake between targeted and untargeted nanoparticles,
indicating that accumulation is predominantly via the passive enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect (Bartlett et al., 2007; Gabizon et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2008; Hussain et
al., 2007; Kirpotin et al., 2006; Lopes de Menezes et al., 1998; Mamot et al., 2005). One
might suspect that transport limitations might conceivably differ in qualitative respects in
actual human tumors by comparison to these model xenografts. However, the presence of
passive targeting has been directly demonstrated in humans, as untargeted stealth liposomes
accumulate at significant levels in tumors (Harrington et al., 2001).
Nanoparticles that are sufficiently small (<50nm diameter) are predicted to distribute in a
fashion more similar to proteins and can therefore exhibit targeting-mediated tumor
accumulation (Fig. 10.2, right). This predicted size dependence is consistent with a number
of published experimental observations. Dendrimers, which are generally <5nm in diameter,
have been shown to accumulate in tumors to a greater extent when conjugated to a ligand
(Kukowska-Latallo et al., 2005). Similarly, iron oxide nanoparticles under 20nm in diameter
accumulate in tumors to a greater extent when conjugated to a specific antibody (DeNardo et
al., 2005). Targeting peptide-conjugated cross-linked iron oxide particles under 40nm in
diameter also exhibits improved tumor accumulation (Kelly et al., 2008).
Despite the fact that targeting does not significantly increase tumor accumulation of
nanoparticles above 50nm in diameter, targeting can enhance therapeutic efficacy. These
advantages are discernable when negative, nontargeted controls are included in studies.
Targeting has been shown to increase tumor cell internalization of nanoparticles, whereas
untargeted nanoparticles are consumed by reticuloendothelial cells such as tumor-associated
macrophages (Kirpotin et al., 2006). Targeting to rapidly internalized antigens provides
greater antitumor efficacy than targeting to a slowly internalized antigens (Sapra and Allen,
2002). Thus targeting-driven endocytosis within the tumor improves efficacy (Bartlett et al.,
2007; Kirpotin et al., 2006), but targeting has a negligible effect at the whole organism
biodistribution level where partitioning amongst clearance organs and the tumor occurs.
4. How Does Affinity Affect Biodistribution?
There is not a single answer to this question—the effect depends dramatically on the size of
the targeting agent. As shown in Fig. 10.3, a compartmental model predicts that smaller
targeting agents require higher affinity in order to be retained in the tumor, while the
retention of larger agents does not depend on affinity to as great an extent. As emphasized in
Section 1, intermediate-sized agents from ~10 to 100kDa in size reside in a “death valley”
where tumor uptake is weak. Smaller peptide-sized targeting agents depend strongly on
binding affinity to accumulate within the tumor, with subnanomolar affinity essentially
required to obtain significant tumor retention.
The general features of this relationship were experimentally confirmed by Zahnd et al.
(2010), with different size and affinity Darpins against HER2. Darpins, at 14.5kDa
molecular weight, are expected to lie on the steep gradient of improving tumor uptake versus
affinity at the bottom of Fig. 10.3. A series of anti-HER2 Darpins were engineered with
increasing affinity (Zahnd et al., 2010): G3-HAVD ( Kd = 270nM), G3-AVD( Kd = 10nM),
G3-D (Kd = 1.5nM), and G3 ( Kd = 0.091n M). The tumor uptake at 24h of technetium-
labeled Darpins were: 0.57% ID/g (G3-HAVD), 2.4% ID/g (G3-AVD), 3.7% ID/g (G3-D),
and 8.1% ID/g (G3). Clearly, for this series of small binding scaffolds, improving affinity
directly improves tumor uptake, consistent with the steep gradient of increasing uptakeWittrup et al. Page 4
Methods Enzymol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptversus affinity at the bottom of Fig. 10.3. Fascinatingly, the story changes when these same
binders are conjugated to PEG20, giving them an apparent molecular weight >300kDa by
size exclusion chromatography. This size places the PEGylated binders at the top of the
plateau in uptake versus Kd and at sizes from 102 to 103kDa. G3-HAVD-PEG20
accumulates to 3.0% ID/g, G3-AVD-PEG20 to 9.2% ID/g, G3-D-PEG20 to 8.6% ID/g, and
G3-PEG20 to 13% ID/g. Fully consistent with the model prediction, for these larger
targeting agents, the dependence of tumor uptake on binding affinity is weak once
Kd<100nM.
The affinity–uptake relationship predicted in Fig. 10.3 was further validated by a series of
anti-HER2 antibodies of varying affinity (Rudnick et al., 2011). These antibodies differed
only by point mutations, bound at the same HER2 epitope, and had very similar plasma
clearance kinetics. The lowest affinity antibody used in this study ( Kd = 270nM) is predicted
to be on the edge of the plateau in Fig. 10.3, while the three higher affinity antibodies ( K =
23, 7.3, and 0.56n M) are predicted to lie squarely on the plateau and therefore have similar
accumulation. When biodistribution studies were performed with all four antibodies using
nonresidualizing radioisotopes, tumor uptake of the 270-n M affinity antibody was
significantly lower than the uptake of all the higher affinity antibodies. By contrast, the
accumulation of the higher affinity antibodies did not differ significantly from each other.
The relationship in Fig. 10.3 only captures the bulk uptake as % ID/g, and does not provide
any information on the pharmacodynamic effect of the targeting agent, or the
microdistribution within the tumor (considered in the following section). For antitumor
agents designed to block receptor/ligand or receptor/receptor interactions, clearly affinity
will be a dominant variable in achieving efficacious tumor control. Further, when antibody-
directed cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is the objective, it has been shown that higher affinity
antibodies lead to more effective NK-mediated cell killing (Tang et al., 2007).
Consequently, the plateau in Fig. 10.3 that extends above 10n M K d for agents the size of
antibodies should not be interpreted as the absence of potential therapeutic benefit for
higher, pM affinity antibodies—it is simply a prediction that for Kd<10nM, bulk antibody
uptake in tumors will not be a strong function of affinity.
5. What Dose Is Necessary in Order to Overcome the “Binding Site
Barrier”?
It has been known since 1989 that high-affinity antibodies may accumulate around the
vasculature and fail to distribute evenly throughout tumors, a phenomenon known by the
term “binding site barrier” (Fujimori et al., 1989). The word “barrier” implies a rigidity and
permanence that fails to appropriately capture the phenomenon, which is actually a dynamic
moving front balancing diffusion, binding, and endocytic consumption (Graff and Wittrup,
2003; Thurber and Wittrup, 2008). The critical role for tumor metabolism of antibodies in
determining penetration has recently been confirmed experimentally in xenografted tumor
models (Rudnick et al., 2011). In this study, it was concluded that “high-density, rapidly
internalizing antigens subject high-affinity antibodies to greater internalization and
degradation, thereby limiting their penetration of tumors.” In essence, the depth an antibody
penetrates into tumor tissue is a dynamic balance between degradation and diffusion
(Thurber et al., 2008a,b), and since diffusion is driven by a concentration gradient, one can
in principle “dose through” the internalization-driven limitation of penetration. In fact, the
Weinstein group that coined the “barrier” nomenclature also demonstrated its dynamic and
flexible nature by overcoming poor microdistribution by raising antibody doses (Blumenthal
et al., 1991; Saga et al., 1995).Wittrup et al. Page 5
Methods Enzymol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 08.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptQuantitative comparison of key timescales can be gainfully employed to determine which
rate processes dominate observed system behaviors. This type of scaling analysis is widely
applied in engineering—for example, the Reynolds number Re=Dvρ/μprovides a
dimensionless ratio of inertial and viscous forces in a fluid flow ( D is the pipe diameter, v
the fluid velocity, ρ the density, and μ the viscosity). The units in the numerator and
denominator cancel out, resulting in a fundamental dimensionless ratio. When Re>2100, the
flow is turbulent; when Re<2100, the flow is laminar. We have applied this flavor of
dimensional analysis to tumor-targeting agents and found that there are two such
dimensionless numbers of particular value in understanding tumor penetration (Thurber et
al., 2007): a clearance modulus and the Thiele modulus.
The clearance modulus Γ compares systemic clearance time to diffusion time within the
tumor. For rapidly clearing agents smaller than the renal filtration threshold, it is possible for
systemic clearance to remove the agent from circulation before the moving diffusion front
within the tumor has fully penetrated the tumor. The clearance modulus is defined as
follows:
where AUC plasma  is the area under curve in plasma for the agent, that is, the integral of
plasma concentration versus time. When Γ>1, the agent clears from plasma before
substantial penetration can occur. Consequently, Γ<1 is a necessary (but not sufficient)
criterion to achieve penetration of the agent throughout the tumor volume. scFv-sized agents
very often fail this criterion due to their rapid clearance rate. In contrast, IgGs are typically
not limited by clearance due to their relatively long serum half-life.
For IgGs and other agents that are not limited by systemic clearance, saturation can be
predicted from the balance between extravasation rate and endocytic consumption. The
dimensionless ratio of these two rates is the Thiele modulus, named after Ernest Thiele who
first derived it in order to understand why industrial catalysts varied in their activity with
size (Thiele, 1939). Substituting endocytic metabolism for surface catalytic rate, and
vascular extravasation rate for diffusion through ceramic pores, one obtains a Thiele
modulus describing tumor penetration (Thurber et al., 2007, 2008a,b):
where ke is the net endocytosis rate constant for degradation of bound antibody. For typical
parameter values, this relationship predicts that for affinities of Kd>1nM, poor spatial
distribution is unlikely to occur. For p M affinities, one can predict the required dosage in a
mouse xenograft experiment by assuming constitutive membrane turnover rates, as in Fig.
10.4. For example, for a tumor cell line expressing 105 antigens/cell, a bolus of at least 10–
70µg of IgG should be sufficient to permeate throughout a tumor. However, for a more
highly expressed antigen at 106/cell, one would require at least 100–700µg doses for
saturation. Since the Thiele modulus is inversely proportional to the surface half-life of
bound antibody, one could expect to encounter significant difficulty with permeation of
antibody–drug conjugates targeted to rapidly internalized antigens with half-lives under an
hour.Wittrup et al. Page 6

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript6. Conclusions
In this chapter, we have provided simple theoretic relationships that provide predictions of
tumor uptake and penetration as a function of targeting agent size and binding affinity. The
particular value of these relationships lies not in their quantitative accuracy, but rather in
predicting trends in expected outcomes as these key design variables are adjusted. For
example, greatest tumor accumulation is expected for proteins ~200 kDa in size—favoring
IgG-like constructs. Nanoparticles 100nm in diameter are not predicted (and have not been
observed) to accumulate to a greater extent in tumors when targeting ligands are attached to
their surfaces. The dynamically poor microdistribution termed the “binding site barrier” can
be overcome by predictable increases in bolus dosing. These relationships may assume
particular importance in the design of antibody–drug conjugates, which are often selected
for rapid endocytosis, and must be dosed at lower levels due to toxicity—conditions
particularly conducive to poor microdistribution.

www.nature.com/scientificreportsPredicting antibody affinity 
changes upon mutations 
by combining multiple predictors
Yoichi Kurumida1, Yutaka Saito1,2,3 & Tomoshi Kameda1*
Antibodies are proteins working in our immune system with high affinity and specificity for target 
antigens, making them excellent tools for both biotherapeutic and bioengineering applications. The prediction of antibody affinity changes upon mutations ( 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  ) is important for antibody 
engineering. Numerous computational methods have been proposed based on different approaches including molecular mechanics and machine learning. However, the accuracy by each individual 
predictor is not enough for efficient antibody development. In this study, we develop a new prediction 
method by combining multiple predictors based on machine learning. Our method was tested on the SiPMAB database, evaluating the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted and experimental 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  . Our method achieved higher accuracy (R = 0.69) than previous molecular 
mechanics or machine-learning based methods (R = 0.59) and the previous method using the average 
of multiple predictors (R = 0.64). Feature importance analysis indicated that the improved accuracy 
was obtained by combining predictors with different importance, which have different protocols for calculating energies and for generating mutant and unbound state structures. This study demonstrates that machine learning is a powerful framework for combining different approaches to predict antibody affinity changes.
Antibodies are proteins working in our immune system that bind to target molecules named antigen such as 
proteins or chemical ligands with high affinity and specificity. Over the past two decades, antibodies have become popular as  biotherapeutics
1. Antibodies have important advantages over small-molecule drugs such as antibody 
dependent cellular  cytotoxicity2 and complement dependent cytotoxicity  activity3. In addition, antibody–drug 
conjugates can kill tumor cells with high  efficiency4,5. Recently, a single chain fragment variable region of an 
antibody is used as a receptor for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell  therapy6,7, highlighting the adaptability and 
efficacy of antibodies as biotherapeutics. Antibody engineering is used to improve the properties of antibodies 
such as affinity, specificity, solubility, and stability. In particular, improving affinity is important for increasing drug efficacy and decreasing the amount of antibody per dose, thereby reducing the drug price. The affinity of an antibody can be improved by introducing mutations in its amino acid sequence while in practice not many 
mutations increase  affinity
8. To date, improving affinity requires trial and error, making many mutants and 
measuring their affinities to identify mutants of interest.
The affinity of an antibody is evaluated by the binding free energy ( /Delta1G binding  ). /Delta1G binding   is calculated by the 
free energy of the bound state minus that of the unbound state. /Delta1G binding   is experimentally measured with sur -
face plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), or enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay. 
Although SPR and ITC have high sensitivity, measuring many samples with SPR and ITC requires substantial time and cost. Therefore, it is important for antibody engineering to develop a method for predicting mutants with high affinity prior to experimental  evaluation
9,10.
A number of software tools have been developed for predicting binding affinity of  complexes11,12, some of 
which are proposed for general protein complexes while others are dedicated specifically to antibody-antigen  complexes
13,14. These methods are largely divided into two approaches: molecular mechanics and machine 
learning. The molecular mechanics methods are based on the evaluation of energies calculated from protein  structures
15,16. Each method utilizes a different scoring function to calculate energies. The typical terms consid-
ered in a scoring function include hydrogen bonding, conformational energies, solvation energies, and entropic OPEN

www.nature.com/scientificreports/terms in addition to Coulombic and van der Waals interaction  energies17. Normally, the molecular mechan -
ics methods take as input the structure of a wild-type complex only, and mutant structures and structures in 
the unbound state are computationally generated (i.e. structure regeneration). Therefore, the performance of molecular mechanics methods depends on the choice of scoring functions and structure regeneration methods. Sulea et al.
17 have presented a benchmark study to investigate the effect of scoring functions and structure regen-
eration methods on the prediction accuracy. As an approach different from molecular mechanics, the machine learning methods are proposed based on statistical models that predict affinity changes upon mutations using feature values calculated from protein complex  structures
13,18. The performance of machine learning methods 
is determined by the choice of statistical models and feature values.
Sulea et al.17 have also proposed a prediction method in their benchmark study. Their prediction method, 
termed consensus scoring, is defined as the average of predicted affinity changes calculated by multiple molecular mechanics methods (multiple predictors). In detail, the Z score is calculated for each of predictors for adjusting their difference in mean and standard deviation. Then, the consensus score is calculated as the average of the Z scores of predictors. The consensus scoring method has shown higher prediction accuracy than any of individual 
molecular mechanics methods (single predictors). However, the consensus scoring method does not consider 
the different importance of predictors since the method simply takes the average of the Z scores of predictors, assuming all features are equally important. In addition, the predictors used in the consensus scoring method have been selected empirically, thus the best combination of predictors for improving accuracy is unknown.
Here, we propose a new computational method for the prediction of antibody affinity changes upon muta -
tions. Our method combines multiple predictors using machine learning. In contrast to the consensus scoring method based on the average of multiple predictors, the use of machine learning enables us to combine multiple predictors with different importance adjusted in model training. The machine learning model takes predictions from multiple methods as feature values (Fig.  1). These predictors include a variety of molecular mechanics 
predictors with various scoring functions and structure regeneration methods as well as a previous machine-learning-based predictor. In experiments on the SiPMAB database, our method achieves higher prediction accu -
racy than the best single predictor and the consensus scoring method. We present feature importance analysis to evaluate the contribution of each predictor in our method, showing that the improved accuracy is obtained by combining predictors using different scoring functions and structure regeneration methods. Moreover, we show that the number of combined predictors can be reduced according to the feature importance without compromising the accuracy.
Results
Prediction accuracy improved by combining multiple predictors. We compared our method with 
the consensus scoring method based on the average of multiple predictors and the 12 kinds of single predictors used as feature values in our method (“ Methods ” section). As proposed in the previous  study
17, we used the 
consensus scoring method with 3 predictors (Cons3 with SIE-Scwrlmut,  Rosmut and FoldX-S) and that with 4 pre-
dictors (Cons4 with SIE-Scwrlmut,  Rosmut, FoldX-S and FoldX-B). Figure  2 shows the Pearson’s correlation coef-
ficient between predicted scores and experimental /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  on the SiPMAB dataset. Our method with GPR 
and RFR achieved R = 0.69 and R = 0.67, respectively, showing better accuracy than Cons3 (R = 0.63) and Cons4 
(R = 0.64). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning for combining multiple predictors to 
improve the prediction accuracy.
The best single predictor was  Rosmut with R = 0.59. For each molecular mechanics software, R > 0.50 was 
achieved by using the best choice of scoring functions and structure regeneration methods: SIE-Scwrlmut,  Rosmut, 
FoldX-B, and DS-B. The accuracy of FoldX-S and DS-S was lower than the other methods, which may be because these methods are based on the stability Eq. ( 3) rather than the binding free energy Eq. ( 1).

www.nature.com/scientificreports/We compared the distribution of predicted scores for each method with experimental  /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  (Supple -
mentary Fig. S1). We found that there were outliers in the predictions of  Rosiface-sc  and  RosCDR-loop . Notably, our 
method with GPR and RFR showed few outliers while it used these features. Such a robustness may be another 
merit of machine learning for combining multiple predictors.
Analysis of feature importance. An advantage of machine learning is the ability to evaluate the impor -
tance of each feature in terms of its contribution to the prediction. We used the feature importance method based on Gini  index
19 implemented in scikit-learn package (Fig.  3). The most important feature was  Rosmut, 
which also achieved the best accuracy among the single predictors (Fig.  2). Similarly, the feature with the sec-
ond-highest accuracy, SIE-Scwrlmut, showed the second-highest feature importance whereas the tendency for 
the rank of accuracy and the rank of feature importance to become equal did not apply to the other features. The

www.nature.com/scientificreports/importance was above 0.1 for 4 features:  Rosmut, SIE-Scwrlmut, mCSM-AB, and DS-B. Interestingly, those predic-
tors were based on different prediction approaches (molecular mechanics or machine learning), and different 
scoring functions and structure regeneration methods for molecular mechanics. These results suggest that the improved accuracy of our method was obtained by combining predictors based on different principles.
Correlation between predictors. We also evaluated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between differ -
ent predictors (Fig.  4). Among the 4 predictors with high feature importance, the molecular mechanics predic-
tors  (Rosmut, SIE-Scwrlmut, and DS-B) were similar to each other (R > 0.66) with  Rosmut and DS-B showing the 
highest correlation. On the other hand, mCSM-AB based on machine learning was distinct from the other pre-dictors (e.g. R = 0.50 between mCSM-AB and  Ros
mut). These results further support that combining predictors 
based on different principles may contribute to improving prediction accuracy.
Reduced features. Although our method uses 12 predictors as input, the number of predictors may be 
reduced, which is desirable for reducing the computational cost. Thus, we developed a prediction method com-bining only four predictors:  Ros
mut, SIE-Scwrlmut, mCSM-AB, and DS-B whose feature importance was higher 
than the others (Fig.  3). Our method using the reduced feature set achieved the accuracy comparable to that 
using the full feature set (Fig.  5). Using GPR as a machine learning model, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
by our method was still higher than that of Cons4 (R = 0.67 compared with R = 0.64, P < 10–15; Wilcoxon signed-
rank test). These results indicate that the number of features used for our method can be reduced without com-promising prediction accuracy.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Evaluation on independent data. In addition to the cross-validation-based evaluation on SiPMAB data-
base, we performed a benchmark study on independent data not included in SiPMAB database (Methods). We 
compared our method using the reduced feature set with the 4 kinds of single predictors used as feature values in our method. Figure  6a shows the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted scores and experimental 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding   on 34 mutants of an antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), called bH1, 
from AB-Bind  database20,21. Our method with GPR and RFR achieved R = 0.54 and R = 0.60, respectively, show-
ing better accuracy than the best single predictor mCSM-AB with R = 0.47. We increased the data size by com-
bining the bH1 data with additional independent data of 12 mutants of an antibody targeting monocyte chemo-
attractant protein-1(MCP-1), called 11K2, from Kiyoshi et al.22, and also confirmed that our method achieved 
better accuracy than the single predictors (Fig.  6b). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learn-
ing for combining multiple predictors to improve prediction accuracy, not only for SiPMAB database but also for independent data.
Discussion
Numerous /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  prediction methods have been developed with a variety of scoring functions and struc -
ture regeneration methods. However, due to the characteristics of each method, /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding   prediction with 
high accuracy has been difficult. In this study, we demonstrated that the prediction accuracy can be improved by combining multiple predictors using machine learning. Our method with GPR achieved R = 0.69 on the 
SiPMAB database (Fig.  2), which was more accurate than the best single predictor  (Ros
mut, R = 0.59) and the 
consensus scoring method based on the average of multiple predictors (Cons4, R = 0.64). The feature impor -
tance analysis suggested that  Rosmut, SIE-Scwrlmut, mCSM-AB, and DS-B were particularly important for the 
improved accuracy (Fig.  3). Our method using these 4 features kept the prediction accuracy comparable to that 
using the full feature set (Fig.  5). Moreover, our method using these 4 features achieved higher accuracy than 
single predictors in the benchmark study on the independent data not included in SiPMAB database (Fig.  6). In 
addition, the feature importance analysis suggested that /Delta1/Delta1Gfolding   (DS-S and FoldX-S) was not so important 
for the improved accuracy (Fig.  3).
The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predictors ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 (Fig.  4). This result indicates 
that each predictor has unique information derived from different prediction approaches (molecular mechan -
ics or machine learning), and different scoring functions and structure regeneration methods for molecular 
mechanics. In particular, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between mCSM-AB and the other predictors based 
on molecular mechanics was lower than the other pairs. This result suggests that combining predictors based on molecular mechanics and machine learning is important for accuracy.
We note that our method has the limitations summarized below. First, although our method achieved higher 
accuracy than single predictors and the previous method using the average of multiple predictors, our meth-ods requires a relatively high computational cost. Second, although our method achieved higher accuracy, it requires training data. On the other hand, the consensus scoring method and single predictors do not require training data. Third, our method, like other existing methods, requires the three-dimensional structure of the

www.nature.com/scientificreports/antigen–antibody complex. However, antibody-antigen complexes are easier to crystalize than monomers 
because the complexes are normally  stable23. In addition, complex structures can be predicted using homology 
 modeling24,25 and docking  simulation26. In this study, we focused on affinity changes upon single point mutations 
as in previous studies. Nonetheless, our method can be easily extended to multiple point mutations by using scores of multiple point mutants as feature values.
In conclusion, our method performs the best for predicting affinity changes upon mutations of antibody-
antigen complexes (  
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  ). The method is more accurate than the single predictors and the consensus 
scoring method using the average of multiple predictors. The improved accuracy is obtained by combining multiple predictors with different importance using machine learning. Our method can contribute to the design of antibodies for therapeutics and diagnostics by improving speed and reducing the associated costs.
Methods
Overview of the proposed method. The idea of our method is to combine multiple predictors for anti-
body affinity changes using machine learning (Fig.  1). The machine learning model takes as input predictions 
from multiple methods as feature values, and outputs the /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  as the final prediction. These predictors 
(feature values) included those based on molecular mechanics with different scoring functions and structure regeneration methods (Table S1). In addition, we also employed a previous machine-learning-based predictor as a feature value in our method (Table S1). We used two different machine learning models and compared their performance: gaussian process regression (GPR)
27 and random forest regressor (RFR)28. GPR and RFR are one 
of the most popular machine learning models, which have been used for study such as antibody engineering  field
29,30. As an advantage of the use of machine learning, our method can evaluate the importance of each fea-
ture in terms of its contribution to the prediction. Specifically, we evaluated the feature importance based on the Gini index in  RFR
19. Our method was implemented in Python using scikit-learn  package31.
Predictors based on molecular mechanics. /Delta1G binding  of an antigen–antibody complex is calculated 
with Eq. (1). GAg+Ab is the Gibbs free energy of the antigen–antibody complex. GAg and GAb are the Gibbs free 
energies of the unbound state of the antigen and the antibody, respectively.
The change in the binding energy after mutagenesis (  /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  ) is calculated with Eq. (2 ). /Delta1Gmutant
binding and 
/Delta1Gwild−type
binding are the /Delta1G binding  of the mutant and the wild-type complexes, respectively.
The stability of an antigen–antibody complex is also calculated because it is related to binding free  energy17. 
The stability (  /Delta1G folding  ) of an antigen–antibody complex is calculated with Eq. ( 3).
Gfold and Gunfold  are the Gibbs free energies of the folded state and the unfolded state, respectively. The change 
in the structure stability after mutagenesis (  /Delta1/Delta1Gfolding  ) is calculated with Eq. (4 ) /Delta1Gmutant
folding and /Delta1Gwild−type
folding are 
the /Delta1G folding  of the mutant and the wild-type complexes, respectively.
In this study, we used 11 molecular mechanics predictors as feature values in our method. Among them, 9 
predictors have been evaluated in the previous benchmark  study17, while 2 predictors were newly employed in 
this study. Each predictor was different in the choice of a scoring function and a structure regeneration method, in addition to whether it used the binding energy Eq. (1 ) or the stability Eq. (3 ). The scoring functions included 
 SIE
32,  Talaris201315, Talaris-interface33, CHARMm Polar  H16 and  FOLDEF34. For regenerating mutant struc-
tures from the wild-type complex structure, only the side chain at the mutated site was repacked with the other 
residues fixed, or the side chains around the mutated site were also repacked (see the details below). Structures in unbound state were refined by separating the antibody and the antigen as rigid bodies, or by refining their structures after the separation. Below, for clarity, we divide the 11 predictors into 4 groups: Discovery Studio (2 
predictors), FoldX (2 predictors), Rosetta (6 predictors), SIE-Scwrl
mut (1 predictor).
Parent structure preparation. Predictors based on molecular mechanics require a parent structure that is 
prepared from an experimental structure for computational analyses. In this study, we used the parent structures 
provided by SiPMAB database for antibodies included in SiPMAB database. For other antibodies not included in SiPMAB database, we prepared the parent structures using the same procedure as SiPMAB database according to Sulea et al.
17 Briefly, the starting structure was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 3BDY for the 
anti-VEGF antibody; 2BDN for the anti-MCP-1-antibody), and we removed non-protein compounds including waters and ions, and deleted non-variable domains in the antibody. Protons were added with neutral pH condi-tion. The structure was energy-minimized using Amber force  field
35,36.
Discovery studio. Discovery  Studio37 is biomolecular simulation software where CHARMm Polar H force 
 field16 is used as a scoring function. Two types of protocols were used by Discovery Studio 2018: DS-B and DS-S.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/(DS-S) was calculated by the “Calculate Mutation Energy (Stability)” protocol. The structure of the mutant was 
refined with repacking and energy minimization of the side chain at the mutated site. The structures in unbound state were refined by rigid separation. All runs were performed with default parameters.
FoldX, SIE- Scwrlmut, and Rosetta. Predictions for SiPMAB by  FoldX34 (FoldX-B and FoldX-S), SIE-
Scwrlmut17, and  Rosetta38 (SIE-Rosmut, SIE-Rosiface-sc , SIE-RosCDR-loop  ,  Rosmut,  Rosiface-sc , and  RosCDR-loop ) were 
obtained from the previous benchmark  study17. Predictions for the complex of anti-VEGF antibody and VEGF 
were calculated according to the previous benchmark  study17. The descriptions of these methods were shown 
in Table S1. Briefly, FoldX is protein free energy calculation software using FOLDEF as a scoring function. Two types of protocols were used by FoldX: FoldX-B and FoldX-S using 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  and /Delta1/Delta1Gfolding  , respectively. 
SIE-Scwrlmut uses 2 software and a scoring function: SCWRL is software for regenerating protein structures 
based on empirical side chain rotamers. Amber is software for molecular dynamics simulation and SIE is a scor -
ing  function32,39. In this protocol, mutant structures after refined by SCWRL with repacking and energy mini-
mization of mutated side chains were further energy-minimized around mutated sites using Amber, and then 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  was calculated using SIE. Rosetta  suite40 is a protein design and structure prediction tool based on 
Monte Carlo simulation. It is capable of predicting scores and generating a mutant structure with backrub sam-pling of the backbone and repacking of side chains. Six types of protocols were used by Rosetta: SIE-Ros
mut, SIE-
Rosiface-sc , SIE-RosCDR-loop ,  Rosmut,  Rosiface-sc , and  RosCDR-loop . Rosetta employed 3 scoring functions:  Talaris201315 
 (Rosiface-sc  and  RosCDR-loop ), Talaris-interface33  (Rosmut), and  SIE32 (SIE-Rosmut, SIE-Rosiface-sc , and SIE-RosCDR-loop ).
Machine-learning-based predictor (mCSM-AB). In addition to molecular mechanics predictors 
described above, we also used a previous machine-learning-based predictor, mCSM-AB13, as a feature value in 
our method. mCSM-AB is a machine learning model that predicts antibody affinity changes using the graph-based signatures of protein structures. In the previous study, the model has been trained using experimental 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  from the AB-Bind  database20. To use mCSM-AB in our method, we took care to prevent the leakage 
of training data into the performance evaluation (see the “ Performance evaluation ” section for details).
Datasets. To assess prediction accuracy, a dataset from the SiPMAB  database17 was used. This dataset is 
comprised of 212 single point mutant antibodies in their CDRs, across 7 different antibody-antigen complexes. The wild-type structures of the antibody-antigen complexes are available, which are solved by high resolution X-ray crystallography. The majority of experimental binding free energies are measured by SPR and ITC. The 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  values range between − 0.65 and 7.32 kcal/mol. When the multiple /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  measurements are 
recorded for the same mutant, which originates from different publications, we selected one /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  value 
as previously  described17. Briefly, the /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  value was selected considering the reliability of assay methods, 
and the scale of the assay in the original publication. Although AB-Bind20 and  SKEMPI41 are another data-
base for affinity changes upon mutations, we used the SiPMAB database since it collects mutants on antibodies excluding mutants on antigens, and thus is more suitable for the purpose of our study.
For evaluation on independent data, 34 mutants of the complex of anti-VEGF antibody, called bH1, and 
VEGF were collected from the AB-Bind. These mutants are not included in SiPMAB database, and have muta -
tions in the antibody side. We also used the data of 12 mutants of the complex of anti-MCP-1 antibody, called 11K2, and MCP-1 from Kiyoshi et al.
22.
Performance evaluation. We evaluated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted and exper -
imental /Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  as a measure of prediction accuracy. To compare the performance of our method with previ-
ous methods, we conducted the following procedures to ensure a fair comparison avoiding potential overfitting.
For RFR, we used fourfold nested cross-validation for optimizing a hyperparameter in our method (the 
number of trees). In the outer loop of the nested cross-validation procedure, the dataset was split into 4 subsets where each subset was used as an independent test dataset named Test and the remaining data were used for the 
inner loop. In the inner loop of the nested cross-validation procedure, the dataset was split into 4 subsets where 
each subset was used as a validation dataset named Validation, and the remaining data were named Training. A model was trained using Training dataset with various hyperparameter values, and the performance was meas -
ured using Validation dataset. The performance of our method with the best hyperparameter value was evaluated using the Test dataset. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted and experimental 
/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding  
was calculated for each Test dataset, and the average value was used as a final evaluation measure. For GPR, we used the radial basis function (RBF) kernel with a constant kernel and a white kernel. The hyperparameters of GPR can be optimized during model training without looking at validation or test datasets by maximizing log-marginal-likelihood as implemented in scikit-learn package. Thus, we conducted a fourfold cross-validation 
rather than a fourfold nested cross-validation.
One of the predictors used in our method, mCSM-AB, was itself based on machine learning. Therefore, we 
took care to ensure that the data used for training mCSM-AB were always separated from the training data of 
our method. The mCSM-AB implemented in the public web server (https ://biosi g.unime  lb.edu.au/mcsm_ab/
predi ction ) has been trained using the AB-Bind database. Thus, we checked the overlap of data between the AB-Bind and SiPMAB databases. For each mutant in the SiPMAB database, when the mutant did not exist in the AB-Bind, we simply used the mCSM-AB web server for calculating the feature value in our method. When the mutant existed in the AB-Bind, we used the mCSM-AB predictions in the ""Predictions on cross validation"" provided by the developers of mCSM-AB (https ://biosi g.unime  lb.edu.au/mcsm_ab/data) rather than the web 
server. These mCSM-AB predictions were obtained from the tenfold cross-validation where the mutant was separated from the training data.8

www.nature.com/scientificreports/In addition to cross-validation-based evaluation above, we performed a benchmark study where our method 
was trained on SiPMAB database, and evaluated on independent data not included in SiPMAB database. For this 
purpose, we used the bH1 data of the anti-VEGF antibody and the 11K2 data from Kiyoshi et al.22.

© The Author(s) 2020",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to predict antibody affinity changes upon mutations using a combination of multiple predictors based on machine learning.,"Research Hypothesis:
A combination of multiple predictors based on machine learning can be used to predict antibody affinity changes upon mutations with higher accuracy than individual predictors or consensus scoring methods.

Research Proposal:
We propose to develop and test a new computational method for predicting antibody affinity changes upon mutations by combining multiple predictors using machine learning. The method will utilize predictions from multiple methods as feature values for machine learning models, and output the binding free energy (/Delta1/Delta1Gbinding) as the final prediction. The predictors will include a variety of molecular mechanics predictors with various scoring functions and structure regeneration methods, as well as a previous machine-learning-based predictor. The performance of the method will be evaluated using datasets from the SiPMAB database, and the accuracy will be compared with that of single predictors and consensus scoring methods. Additionally, feature importance analysis will be conducted to evaluate the contribution of each predictor in the method, and the number of combined predictors will be optimized to reduce computational cost without compromising prediction accuracy. Finally, the method will be evaluated on independent data not included in the SiPMAB database to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving prediction accuracy."

AbstractHuman tumours typically harbour a remarkable number of somatic mutations1. If presented on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHCI), peptides containing these mutations could potentially be immunogenic as they should be recognized as ‘non-self’ neo-antigens by the adaptive immune system. Recent work has confirmed that mutant peptides can serve as T-cell epitopes2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. However, few mutant epitopes have been described because their discovery required the laborious screening of patient tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes for their ability to recognize antigen libraries constructed following tumour exome sequencing. We sought to simplify the discovery of immunogenic mutant peptides by characterizing their general properties. We developed an approach that combines whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis with mass spectrometry to identify neo-epitopes in two widely used murine tumour models. Of the >1,300 amino acid changes identified, ∼13% were predicted to bind MHCI, a small fraction of which were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The peptides were then structurally modelled bound to MHCI. Mutations that were solvent-exposed and therefore accessible to T-cell antigen receptors were predicted to be immunogenic. Vaccination of mice confirmed the approach, with each predicted immunogenic peptide yielding therapeutically active T-cell responses. The predictions also enabled the generation of peptide–MHCI dextramers that could be used to monitor the kinetics and distribution of the anti-tumour T-cell response before and after vaccination. These findings indicate that a suitable prediction algorithm may provide an approach for the pharmacodynamic monitoring of T-cell responses as well as for the development of personalized vaccines in cancer patients.

Extended data figures and tablesExtended Data Figure 1 TRAMP-C1 tumours are less immunogenic than MC-38 tumours.a, MC-38 or TRAMP-C1 tumours (150–250 mm3 in size) were grown in vivo in C57BL/6 mice. TILs were collected and screened by flow cytometry to quantitate absolute numbers of CD45+ immune cells or CD8 T cells in each tumour sample. n = 9 for MC-38 and n = 5 for TRAMP-C1. **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001 by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. b, MHCI surface expression on MC-38 and TRAMP-C1 cell lines. Cells grown in vitro were stained with anti-H-2Db (biotinylated) or anti-H-2Kb (PE-conjugated) antibodies or isotype controls and analysed for surface expression by flow cytometry.Extended Data Figure 2 Tandem mass spectra of endogenous mutant MC-38 MHC antigen peptides and their corresponding synthetic peptides.a, AALLNSAVL; b, AQLANDVVL; c, ASM(ox)TNM(ox)ELM(ox), ox, oxidized; d, MAPIDHTTM; e, SSPYSLHYL; f, SIIVFNLL; and g, EEKNTGLI. The peak at 460.9511 m/z corresponds to a co-eluting, singly charged contaminant background ion isolated with peptide precursor (EEKNTGLI is an example of a low-confidence spectral identification, based on comparing the endogenous and synthetic spectra). Mutation sites are indicated with the amino acid underlined. Spectral differences in endogenous and synthetic peptide spectra maybe due to co-eluting peptides in the highly complex sample. Although present, not all fragment ions are labelled due to overlapping peak labels.Extended Data Figure 3 Variant peptide expression is retained in vivo for the chosen peptides.Total RNA-seq reads covering the variant position for the genes corresponding to the 7 MS/MS-identified variant peptides are shown. Both the reference and the alternate alleles are shown for an in vitro and an in vivo sample of the MC-38 line. Expression of the variant allele is observable both in vitro and in vivo. Alt, alternate allele; Ref, reference allele.Extended Data Figure 4 Tandem mass spectra of endogenous wild-type MC-38 MHC antigen peptides and their corresponding synthetic peptides.a–c, Wild-type MC-38 peptides AQLPNDVVL (a), ASM(ox)TNRELM(ox), ox, oxidized (b), and SSISNFQAV (c). Spectral differences in endogenous and synthetic peptide spectra maybe due to co-eluting peptides in the highly complex sample. Although present, not all fragment ions are labelled due to overlapping peak labels.Extended Data Figure 5 wild-type-counterpart peptides for Adpgk and Reps1 are not immunogenic in vivo.a–d, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 100 µg wild-type or mutant Adpgk or Reps1 peptides with adjuvant (100 µg Poly (I:C) plus 50 µg anti-CD40) or adjuvant alone, at day 0 and day 14. At day 21, splenic CD8 T cells from mice immunized with wild-type (GIPVHLELASMTNRELMSSIVHQQVFPT) or mutant (GIPVHLELASMTNMELMSSIVHQQVFPT) Adpgk peptide were stained with mut-Adpgk–H-2Db dextramers (a) or WT-Adpgk–H-2Db dextramers (b). Similarly CD8 T cells from mice immunized with wild-type (GRVLELFRAAQLPNDVVLQIMELCGATR) or mutant Reps1 (GRVLELFRAAQLANDVVLQIMELCGATR) peptide were stained with Mut-Reps1/H-2Db dextramers (c) or WT-Reps1/H-2Db dextramers (d) and analysed by flow cytometry. Frequency of indicated peptide–MHCI dextramer+ of CD8 T cells is shown. Mice immunized with adjuvant alone were used as the reference.

The combination of genome-wide exome and transcriptome analysis, mass spectrometry, and computational structural modeling can be used to predict immunogenic tumour mutations.

Research Proposal:
We propose to use a comprehensive approach that combines whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis with mass spectrometry to identify neo-epitopes in tumour models. By characterizing the general properties of immunogenic mutant peptides, we aim to simplify the discovery of these peptides and predict their potential immunogenicity. This approach will enable the development of personalized vaccines and provide a means for pharmacodynamic monitoring of T-cell responses in cancer patients."

Knowing the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding 
proteins is essential for developing models of the regulatory processes in biological systems and for identifying causal 
disease variants. Here we show that sequence specificities 
can be ascertained from experimental data with ‘deep 
learning’ techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro  data and testing on 
in vivo  data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a 
stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined 
by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of 
position weight matrices or as a ‘mutation map’ that indicates 
how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.
DNA- and RNA-binding proteins play a central role in gene regula -
tion, including transcription and alternative splicing. The sequence 
specificities of a protein are most commonly characterized using position weight matrices
1 (PWMs), which are easy to interpret and 
can be scanned over a genomic sequence to detect potential binding 
sites. However, growing evidence indicates that sequence specifici -
ties can be more accurately captured by more complex techniques2–5. 
Recently, ‘deep learning’ has achieved record-breaking performance 
in a variety of information technology applications6,7. We adapted 
deep learning methods to the task of predicting sequence specificities 
and found that they compete favorably with the state of the art. Our 
approach, called DeepBind, is based on deep convolutional neural 
networks and can discover new patterns even when the locations of patterns within sequences are unknown—a task for which traditional 
neural networks require an exorbitant amount of training data.
There are several challenging aspects in learning models of sequence 
specificity using modern high-throughput technologies. First, the data come in qualitatively different forms. Protein binding microarrays 
(PBMs)
8 and RNAcompete assays9 provide a specificity coefficient  
for each probe sequence, whereas chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq
10 provides a ranked list of putatively bound sequences of 
varying length, and HT-SELEX11 generates a set of very high affinity 
sequences. Second, the quantity of data is large. A typical high-throughput  
experiment measures between 10,000 and 100,000 sequences, and it is 
computationally demanding to incorporate them all. Third, each data 
acquisition technology has its own artifacts, biases and limitations, and 
we must discover the pertinent specificities despite these unwanted effects. For example, ChIP-seq reads often localize to “hyper-ChIPable” regions of the genome near highly expressed genes
12.
DeepBind ( Fig. 1) addresses the above challenges. (i) It can be 
applied to both microarray and sequencing data; (ii) it can learn from millions of sequences through parallel implementation on a graphics processing unit (GPU); (iii) it generalizes well across technologies, even without correcting for technology-specific biases; (iv) it can  
tolerate a moderate degree of noise and mislabeled training data; and  
(v) it can train predictive models fully automatically, alleviating the 
need for careful and time-consuming hand-tuning. Importantly, a 
trained model can be applied and visualized in ways that are familiar to users of PWMs. We explored two downstream applications: uncovering  
the regulatory role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in alternative splicing, and analyzing disease-associated genetic variants that can 
affect transcription factor binding and gene expression.
RESULTS
Training DeepBind and scoring sequences
For training, DeepBind uses a set of sequences and, for each sequence, 
an experimentally determined binding score. Sequences can have  
varying lengths (14–101 nt in our experiments), and binding scores can 
be real-valued measurements or binary class labels. For a sequence s,  
DeepBind computes a binding score f
  (s) using four stages:
f s sW b M ( ) ( ( ( ( ))))=net pool rect conv
The convolution stage (conv M) scans a set of motif detectors with 
parameters M across the sequence. Motif detector Mk is a 4 × m matrix, 
much like a PWM of length m but without requiring coefficients to  
be probabilities or log odds ratios. The rectification stage isolates  
positions with a good pattern match by shifting the response of  
detector Mk by bk and clamping all negative values to zero. The pool-
ing stage computes the maximum and average of each motif detec -
tor’s rectified response across the sequence; maximizing helps to 
identify the presence of longer motifs, whereas averaging helps to Predicting the sequence specificities of D nA- and

identify cumulative effects of short motifs, and the contribution of 
each is determined automatically by learning. These values are fed 
into a nonlinear neural network with weights W, which combines 
the responses to produce a score ( Fig. 2 a, Supplementary Fig. 1  and 
Supplementary Notes , sec. 1.1).
We use deep learning techniques13–16 to infer model parameters 
and to optimize algorithm settings. Our training pipeline ( Fig. 
2b) alleviates the need for hand tuning, by automatically adjusting 
many calibration parameters, such as the learning rate, the degree of 
momentum14, the mini-batch size, the strength of parameter regu -
larization, and the dropout probability15.
To obtain the results reported below, we trained DeepBind mod -
els on a combined 12 terabases of sequence data, spanning thou -
sands of public PBM, RNAcompete, ChIP-seq and HT-SELEX 
experiments. We provide the source code 
for DeepBind together with an online 
repository ( http://tools.genes. toronto.edu/
deepbind /) of 927 DeepBind models rep -
resenting 538 distinct transcription factors  
and 194 distinct RBPs, each of which was 
trained on high-quality data and can be 
applied to score new sequences using an eas -
ily installed executable file with no hardware 
or software requirements.
Ascertaining DNA sequence specificities
To evaluate DeepBind’s ability to charac -
terize DNA-binding protein specificity, we 
used PBM data from the revised DREAM5 
TF-DNA Motif Recognition Challenge by 
Weirauch et al.17. The PBM data represent 
86 different mouse transcription factors, 
each measured using two independent 
array designs. Both designs contain ~40,000 
probes that cover all possible 10-mers, 
and all nonpalindromic 8-mers, 32 times.  
Participating teams were asked to train on 
the probe intensities using one array design 
and to predict the intensities of the held-out 
array design, which was not made available 
to participants.Weirauch et al.17 evaluated 26 algorithms 
that can be trained on PBM measurements, 
including FeatureREDUCE17, BEEML-
PBM18, MatrixREDUCE19, RankMotif++20 
and Seed-and-Wobble21. For each indi -
vidual algorithm, they optimized the data 
preprocessing steps to attain best test per -
formance. Methods were evaluated using the 
Pearson correlation between the predicted 
and actual probe intensities, and values from 
the area under the receiver operating char -
acteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) computed by 
setting high-intensity probes as positives 
and the remaining probes as negatives17. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the largest 
independent evaluation of this type. When we 
tested DeepBind under the same conditions, 
it outperformed all 26 methods ( Fig. 3 a).  
DeepBind also ranked first among 15 teams 
when we submitted it to the online DREAM5 evaluation script 
(Supplementary Table 1 ).
To assess the ability of DeepBind models trained using in vitro  
PBM data to predict sequence specificities measured using in vivo  
ChIP-seq data, we followed the method described by Weirauch  
et al.17. Predicting transcription factor binding in vivo  is more difficult  
because it is affected by other proteins, the chromatin state and the 
physical accessibility of the binding site. We found that DeepBind 
also achieves the highest score when applied to the in vivo  ChIP-seq 
data ( Fig. 3 b and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The best method reported 
in the original evaluation (Team_D, a k-mer-based model) and the 
best reported in the revised evaluation (FeatureREDUCE, a hybrid 
PWM/ k-mer model) both had reasonable, but not the best, perform -
ance on in vivo  data, which might be due to overfitting to PBM noise17.

Figure 2  Details of inner workings of DeepBind and its training procedure. ( a) Five independent 
sequences being processed in parallel by a single DeepBind model. The convolve, rectify, 
pool and neural network stages predict a separate score for each sequence using the current 
model parameters ( Supplementary Notes , sec. 1). During the training phase, the backprop and 
update stages simultaneously update all motifs, thresholds and network weights of the model to 
improve prediction accuracy. ( b) The calibration, training and testing procedure used throughout 
(Supplementary Notes , sec. 2).Figure 1  DeepBind’s input data, training procedure and applications. 1. The sequence specificities 
of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins can now be measured by several types of high-throughput  
assay, including PBM, SELEX, and ChIP- and CLIP-seq techniques. 2. DeepBind captures these 
binding specificities from raw sequence data by jointly discovering new sequence motifs along with 
rules for combining them into a predictive binding score. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are 
used to automatically train high-quality models, with expert tuning allowed but not required. 3. The 
resulting DeepBind models can then be used to identify binding sites in test sequences and  
to score the effects of novel mutations.

DeepBind motifs for DREAM5 data and the data sets that follow are 
available in the online repository.
Ascertaining RNA sequence specificities
We next evaluated the ability of DeepBind to identify RNA binding 
sites. For experimental training data, we used previously published 
binding data for 207 distinct RBPs from 24 eukaryotes, including 
85 distinct human RBPs22, which were generated using the in vitro  
RNAcompete system9. These RBPs span different structural families, 
such as the RNA recognition motif, hnRNP K-homology domain and 
multiple zinc finger families. The arrays contain ~240,000 short single-  
stranded probes (30–41 nt) that cover all 9-mers at least 16 times and 
all 7-mers at least 155 times. The probes were randomly split into 
two similarly sized sets called SetA and SetB. Note that RNAcompete 
probes were designed to have only weak secondary structure and may 
not fully reflect the specificities of structure-selective RBPs such as 
Vtsp1 (ref. 23).
We trained DeepBind on RNAcompete SetA sequences and evalu -
ated its predictive accuracy on held-out SetB sequences. DeepBind 
consistently had better overall performance than MartixREDUCE19 
and Ray et al. ’s9 PWM_align_Z method ( Fig. 3 c). This result was con -
sistent across a panel of evaluation methods, including Pearson and 
Spearman correlations between the predicted and measured probe 
intensities, Pearson and Spearman correlations between all 7-mer  
E-scores (rank-based) and Z-scores (intensity-based), and AUCs com -
puted from predicted and actual probe intensities ( Supplementary 
Notes , sec. 4.2, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ).  
E-score correlation is robust to outliers and array biases21. Correlations 
of 7-mer scores can be computed using measured data, providing upper bounds on performance. Strikingly, DeepBind performs as well 
as experimental E-scores ( Fig. 3 c).
We also applied models trained on in vitro  RNAcompete data to  
in vivo  CLIP-seq (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by 
high-throughput sequencing) and RIP-seq (RNA-immunoprecipitation  
sequencing) data22. DeepBind was comparable or substantially  
better than published PFMs (position frequency matrices) on  
the in vivo  data sets we considered, in particular TARDBP , PTBP1 and 
hnRNP A1 ( Fig. 3 d; Supplementary Notes , sec. 4.3, Supplementary 
Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The ROC curves for Figure 3 d 
are in Supplementary Figure 5 .
We found that it is more challenging to train models to predict 
RBP sequence specificities than transcription factor specificities. 
Even though the DREAM5 transcription factor training and testing 
data sets were collected using different array designs, the Spearman 
correlations between predicted and measured probe intensities were 
significantly higher for DREAM5 transcription factors than for 
RNAcompete RBPs ( P = 1.8 × 10−30; one-sided Mann-Whitney U test;  
0.758 average, n = 66 and 0.439 average, n = 244, respectively). There 
are several potential reasons. First, RBPs usually bind to single-  
stranded RNA22, which is more flexible than DNA and can fold into 
a relatively stable secondary structure. Second, RNA recognition 
motif, the most abundant RNA binding domain, is highly flexible, 
and usually the assembly of multiple domains are needed for proper 
binding24. Third, “indirect readout”5 in which the structure of nucle -
otides guide the binding process, is more prominent in RBPs; Gupta 
and Gribskov25 analyzed 211 protein-RNA structural complexes 
and reported that nearly three-quarters of protein-RNA interactions 
involve the RNA backbone, not just the bases.0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0

In vitro  models accurately identify in vivo  bound sequences
We next evaluated DeepBind’s performance using 506 in vivo  
ENCODE ChIP-seq data sets, which were preprocessed to remove 
protocol and laboratory biases26 (Supplementary Table 4 ). Unlike 
experiments with in vitro  data, these experiments were influenced 
by cell type–specific effects, transcription factor-nucleosome interac -
tions, cooperation and competition between transcription factors and 
other cofactors, and pioneer transcription factors that can remodel 
chromatin and facilitate the binding of other transcription factors27. To train DeepBind, we used as positives the 101-bp sequences centered  
at the point source called for each peak, and we used shuffled posi -
tive sequences with matching dinucleotide composition as negatives 
(same as ENCODE’s analysis27; Supplementary Notes , sec. 3).
For computational reasons, most existing methods analyze only 
the top few hundred peaks from among tens of thousands of peaks 
(the median number of peaks for ENCODE is ~17,000). However, 
Wang et al.27 found that, for example, ~16,000 of the top ~20,000 SPI1 
peaks contain the SPI1 motif. For each data set, DeepBind was able to

incorporate all ChIP-seq training peaks, and our results suggest that 
these extra peaks provide useful information. Specifically, we used 
the top 500 even-numbered peaks as held-out test data and trained 
models on either all other peaks (DeepBind*) or just the top 500 
odd-numbered peaks (DeepBind) ( Supplementary Notes , sec. 6.1  
and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). For comparison, we also applied MEME-
ChIP28 to the same top 500 odd-numbered training peaks, derived 
five PWMs for each experiment using the ENCODE settings27, and 
scored test sequences using either the top PWM (MEME-M1) or the 
sum of scores for all five PWMs (MEME-SUM). MEME-ChIP could 
not be trained using all possible training peaks due to computational 
limitations.
The 506 ChIP-seq experiments represent 137 unique transcrip -
tion factors, so we computed one AUC for each transcription  
factor by taking its median test AUC across all associated experiments 
(antibodies, cell lines, laboratories). DeepBind trained on the top 500 
odd peaks achieved higher test AUC (0.85 average) than both MEME-
SUM (0.82 average; P = 2 × 10−15, Wilcoxon one-sided signed-rank 
test, n = 137) and MEME-M1 (0.78 average; P = 1 × 10−23). By training 
DeepBind* on all peaks not held out we achieved significantly higher 
test AUC (0.90 average) than training on the top 500 odd peaks either 
DeepBind ( P = 2.4 × 10−20) or MEME-SUM ( P = 7 × 10−23) (Fig. 3 e and 
Supplementary Table 5 ). We additionally tested the DeepBind FoxA2 
ChIP-seq model using 64 ‘electrophoretic mobility shift assay’ (EMSA)-
measured binding affinities29 and found that it achieves the highest 
Spearman correlation among published methods, including JASPAR 
PWMs30, TRANSFAC PWMs31, and other models trained on ChIP-seq 
data ( Supplementary Notes , sec. 6.3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 ).
We also trained DeepBind on Jolma et al. ’s in vitro  HT-SELEX 
data for 303 human DNA-binding domains, 84 mouse DNA-binding 
domains and 151 full-length human transcription factors, represent -
ing 411 distinct transcription factors32 (Supplementary Table 6 ). 
DeepBind achieved higher test AUC (0.71 average) than the PWMs 
discovered by Jolma et al. ’s semi-automatic 
algorithm32 (0.63 average; P = 2.8 × 10−94, 
Wilcoxon one-sided signed-rank test, n = 566) 
(Fig. 3 e and Supplementary Notes , sec. 7.2, 
and Supplementary Table 7 ). We next evalu -
ated the performance of several HT-SELEX 
models for which there exists correspond -
ing in vivo  ChIP-seq data from ENCODE. 
DeepBind achieved higher in vivo  AUC (0.85 
average) than both the best-possible choice of 
Jolma et al. ’s PWMs32 (0.82 average; P = 0.001 
Wilcoxon one-sided signed-rank test, n = 35) and the best MEME-ChIP configuration MEME-SUM-5k (0.82 average; 
P = 0.002), suggesting that DeepBind can generalize from HT-SELEX 
to other data acquisition technologies despite being based on a general-  
purpose machine learning framework ( Fig. 3 f and Supplementary 
Notes , sec. 7.3, and Supplementary Table 8 ). The ROC curves for 
Figure 3 f are in Supplementary Figure 8 .
Identifying and visualizing damaging genetic variants
Genetic variants that create or abrogate binding sites can alter gene 
expression patterns and potentially lead to disease33. A promising 
direction in precision medicine is to use binding models to identify, 
group and visualize variants that potentially change protein binding. To 
explore the effects of genetic variations using DeepBind, we developed a 
visualization called a ‘mutation map’ ( Supplementary Notes , sec. 10.1),  
which illustrates the effect that every possible point mutation in a 
sequence may have on binding affinity. A mutation map conveys two 
types of information. First, for a given sequence, the mutation map 
shows how important each base is for the DeepBind analysis by the 
height of the base letter. Second, the mutation map includes a heat map 
of size 4 by n, where n is the sequence length, indicating how much 
each possible mutation will increase or decrease the binding score.
We examined variants within promoters using nearly 600 DeepBind 
models trained using ChIP-seq and HT-SELEX data. Figure 4 a  
shows how several Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)34  
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) disrupted an SP1 binding site in the 
LDL-R  promoter, leading to familial hypercholesterolemia35. It can 
be seen in the wild-type mutation map that all HGMD SNVs falling  
in the SP1 binding site decrease the score. Figure 4 b depicts how 
a cancer risk variant (rs6983267) in a MYC  enhancer36 weakens a 
TCF7L2 binding site. Figure 4 c illustrates how an inherited gain-  
of-function SNP creates a GATA1 binding site in the globin cluster, 
disrupting the original globin cluster promoters37. GATA4 is known 
to regulate Bcl-2  (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) expression in ovarian Binding score Binding score Binding score

granulosa cell tumors38. We analyzed all 
COSMIC 69 (ref. 39) SNVs located in the 
Bcl-2  promoters and found two that damage 
a single GATA4 binding site ( Fig. 4 d).
One notable example involves tandem 
RFX3 binding sites in the GPR56  promoter. A 
15-bp deletion of a highly conserved segment  
deletes one of the binding sites, resulting in abnormal cortical  
development40. DeepBind analysis discovered a third RFX3 binding 
site located on the opposite strand, overlapping both of the known 
tandem binding sites ( Fig. 4 e), and so the 15-bp deletion might 
destroy this third RFX binding site as well.
Two of the highest-scoring SNV-ridden promoters in HGMD belong 
to HBB  (hemoglobin beta chain) and F7 (coagulation factor VII). 
Disruption of these two genes results in β-thalassemia and hemophilia, 
respectively. Figure 4f ,g shows how numerous HGMD SNVs might 
damage transcription factor binding sites in these promoters.
Lastly, it was shown that mutations in the TERT  (telomerase  
reverse transcriptase) promoter are linked to many types of aggressive 
cancer41, mostly by gain-of-function mutations creating ETS fam -
ily42,43 or GABP41 transcription factor binding sites. We analyzed 
the TERT  promoter using DeepBind ETS (ELK1/ELK4) and GABP- α 
models and the resulting mutation maps all show potential gain-of-
function mutations corresponding to the literature. In Figure 4 h, all 
COSMIC 69 SNVs observed in the analyzed regions are shown. It can 
be seen that the two highly recurrent somatic G →A SNVs (G228A and 
G250A) create the strongest putative GABP- α binding sites, which 
have each been confirmed to increase expression of TERT41. In addi -
tion to these highly recurrent mutations, DeepBind also identified a 
familial T →G mutation that is known to increase TERT  expression, 
potentially by introducing a GABP- α binding site42.
DeepBind models identify deleterious genomic variants
We investigated whether DeepBind can be used to predict deleterious 
SNVs in promoters, by training a deep neural network to discrimi -
nate between high-frequency derived alleles (neutral or negative) and 
simulated variants (putatively deleterious, or positive) from the CADD 
framework44. The scores of ~600 DeepBind transcription factor mod -
els for the wild type and mutant sequences were used as inputs (~1,200 
inputs; Supplementary Fig. 9 ). The rationale is that a true transcrip -
tion factor binding site is likely to be located with other transcription 
factor binding sites, and so these additional scores collectively provide 
context. When evaluated using held-out test data, the neural network, 
called DeepFind, achieved an AUC of 0.71, which increased to 0.73 
when we included as inputs the distance to the closest transcription 
start site and a transversion/transition flag. When we included nine conservation features, the AUC increased to 0.76. Supplementary 
Figure 10  shows that distribution of DeepFind scores for derived  
alleles and simulated variants. For comparison, the published genome-
wide CADD scores achieved an AUC of 0.64, even though they were 
computed using hundreds of features, including overlapping ChIP-seq 
peaks, transcription factor binding sites, DNA accessibility profiles and 
chromatin state, among others ( Supplementary Notes , sec. 9).
In vitro  models are consistent with known splicing patterns
Alternative splicing, through which multiple transcripts are pro -
duced from a single gene, is responsible for generating significant 
transcriptional diversity in metazoa, to the degree that more than 95% 
of multi-exon human genes are alternatively spliced45. RBPs play a 
crucial role in regulating splicing, having an impact on a wide variety 
of developmental stages such as stem cell differentiation46 and tis -
sue development47. We predicted binding scores at junctions near 
exons that are putatively regulated by known splicing regulators that 
exhibit large changes in splicing when knocked down, including: Nova 
(neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 and 2), PTBP1 (polypyrimidine  
tract binding protein 1), Mbnl1/2 (muscleblind-like protein), hnRNP C  
(heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C) and cytotoxic TIA  
(T-cell intracellular antigen-like 1).
Predictions were consistent with experimental CLIP-seq data and 
known binding profiles of studied RBPs ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary 
Notes , sec. 8, and Supplementary Table 9 ). For example, exons known 
to be downregulated by Nova had higher Nova scores in their upstream 
introns, and exons known to be upregulated by Nova had higher Nova 
scores in their downstream intron48. Similarly, TIA has been shown to 
upregulate exons when bound to the downstream intron49, and PTBP1 
has been shown to suppress exon inclusion when bound to upstream 
introns of weaker splice sites50.
DISCUSSION
Though there is no single agreed upon metric for evaluating the  
quality of sequence specificity predictions17, we found that DeepBind 
surpasses the state of the art across a wide variety of data sets and 
evaluation metrics. Importantly, our results show that DeepBind 
models trained in vitro  work well at scoring in vivo  data, suggest -
ing an ability to capture genuine properties of nucleic acid binding

(CTCF, NR4A2), and secondary motifs (PTBP1,

interactions. DeepBind scales well to large data sets and, for both 
ChIP-seq and HT-SELEX, we found that there was valuable infor -
mation to be learned from sequences that other techniques discard  
for computational reasons.
A frequent concern with large, deep models is that they can overfit 
the training data. To address this, we incorporated several regularizers 
developed in the deep learning community, including dropout, weight 
decay and early stopping ( Supplementary Notes , sec. 2). Indeed, we 
found that the calibration phase of DeepBind training was crucial 
for obtaining models that generated robust predictions on held-out 
test data; our experiments indicate that at least 30 calibration set -
tings should be evaluated to obtain reliable training settings across all  
data sets ( Supplementary Notes , sec. 2.2). Automatic calibration and 
training ( Fig. 2 b) are computationally demanding, so we implemented 
these stages on powerful GPUs for a 10–70× acceleration. Once a model  
was trained, we extracted its parameters and provided a CPU imple -
mentation of the model for easy application by downstream users. 
Users can browse the available RBP and transcription factor mod -
els using our online repository, which displays a familiar PWM-like  
representation of each model ( Fig. 6).
DeepBind is based on deep learning, a scalable and modular pattern 
discovery method, and does not rely on common application-specific 
heuristics such as ‘seed finding’ . Deep learning furthermore has an 
extremely active research community that is garnering huge invest -
ment from academia and industry; we believe current and future 
insights from the deep learning community will lead to enhancements 
to DeepBind and to sequence analysis in general.

Deep learning techniques.  We implemented several of the simplest  
and most effective techniques now practiced within the deep learning  
community: mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Nesterov 
momentum14, rectified linear units6 (ReLUs), dropout regularization15,  
automatic model selection through calibration16 (‘hyper-parameter  
search’) and, finally, GPU acceleration to facilitate fast training on large data sets. When combined, these simple techniques have achieved  
breakthrough performance in computer vision
6, speech recognition7 and 
more. Supplementary Notes , sec. 1 and 2 explain the role of each technique 
in more detail.
Given a specific convolutional network architecture (number of 
motif detectors, lengths of motif detectors, width of pooling, number of  
layers, number of parameters), the training procedure for DeepBind is  
conceptually straightforward and can be outlined as follows. At the  
outset of training, all parameters are initialized to random values (Supplementary Notes , sec. 2.1). A ‘mini-batch’ of N randomly selected  
input sequences is then fed through the network, generating N (initially  
random) score predictions. The discrepancy between each prediction and 
its corresponding target is used to improve the performance of the network 
through a step known as ‘back-propagation’ ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary 
Notes , sec. 1.2). Training then continues with a new mini-batch of N  
randomly selected input sequences. The number of iterations (mini-batches) used in a final training run is determined by the automatic calibration 
phase.
Back propagation is merely an efficient way to compute the partial  
derivative of each parameter of a deep model with respect to a train -
ing objective. Given a random mini-batch of training sequences s
(1.N) and  corresponding target scores t(1.N), the performance of the network is improved 
by approximately minimizing the training objective

Automatic calibration.  Deep neural networks typically require human expertise 
and repeated manual attempts to train correctly. The reason is that the networks 
themselves, and their training procedure, are sensitive to many calibration param -
eters, also known as ‘hyper-parameters’ or ‘nuisance parameters’ ( Supplementary 
Notes , sec. 2.1). Calibration parameters must be chosen to avoid under- or overfit -
ting to the training data, but are otherwise irrelevant to the end-user. For neural  
networks, typical parameters include ‘learning rates’ , ‘network depth’ , ‘initial 
weights’ and ‘weight decay’ . The complete list of hyperparameters and the way 
they are sampled are summarized in Supplementary Table 10 . Similarly, for 
support vector machines one must likewise choose a kernel function and weight 
decay. For random forests one must choose a tree depth and an ensemble size.
For each DeepBind model to be trained, we randomly sampled 30 complete 
sets of calibration parameters16, and for each fold of a three-way random split 
of the training data we trained 30 models in parallel on a single GPU. We rate each calibration by its average validation performance across those folds (threefold cross-validation AUC or mean squared error). The best calibration 
was then used to train a new model on all the training data ( Supplementary 
Notes , sec. 2.2). The code for performing the experiments is available for

"Quantitating Antibody Uptake In Vivo : Conditional Dependence
on Antigen Expression Levels

Abstract
Purpose— Antibodies form an important class of cancer therapeutics, and there is intense interest
in using them for imaging applications in diagnosis and monitoring of cancer treatment. Despite
the expanding body of knowledge describing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions
of antibodies in vivo , discrepancies remain over the effect of antigen expression level on tumoral
uptake with some reports indicating a relationship between uptake and expression and others
showing no correlation.
Procedures— Using a cell line with high EpCAM expression and moderate EGFR expression,
fluorescent antibodies with similar plasma clearance were imaged in vivo . A mathematical model
and mouse xenograft experiments were used to describe the effect of antigen expression on uptake
of these high affinity antibodies.
Results— As predicted by the theoretical model, under subsaturating conditions, uptake of the
antibodies in such tumors is similar because localization of both probes is limited by delivery from
the vasculature. In a separate experiment, when the tumor is saturated, the uptake becomes
dependent on the number of available binding sites. In addition, targeting of small
micrometastases is shown to be higher than larger vascularized tumors.
Conclusions— These results are consistent with the prediction that high affinity antibody uptake
is dependent on antigen expression levels for saturating doses and delivery for subsaturating
doses. It is imperative for any probe to understand whether quantitative uptake is a measure of
biomarker expression or transport to the region of interest. The data provide support for a
predictive theoretical model of antibody uptake, enabling it to be used as a starting point for the
design of more efficacious therapies and timely quantitative imaging probes.

Introduction
Antibodies are used to treat a variety of cancers, and increasingly, they are being tested as
imaging agents for patient selection and monitoring of therapeutic effectiveness[1-3]. These
macromolecules are able to specifically bind to a target antigen of interest with high affinity
and specificity, blocking signaling receptors and/or recruiting the host immune system to
disrupt growth and destroy the cells. Current therapeutic efforts are being made to attach
biological toxins or radioisotopes (either directly or in multi-step therapies) to provide
additional mechanisms for cancer cell death[4-7]. For imaging, they are being fluorescently

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscripttagged for fluorescence guided surgery[8-11] and radiolabeled for patient selection and
monitoring during treatment[12-15]. One problem with these therapies is that they are
expensive and only a fraction of patients respond. Ideally, an imaging agent would be able to
identify responders prior to the initiation of treatment.
Despite extensive research with these drugs, there is still discrepancy over the effect of the
expression level of the target on cells and the uptake in vivo . Some reports indicate a
correlation between uptake and expression level[1,16,17] as one may intuitively expect.
However, other results show no correlation between expression and uptake[18,19] and have
implicated vascularization as a better predictor of uptake[20]. It is imperative to understand
the conditions under which localization is proportional to antigen expression, otherwise the
imaging signal intensity may incorrectly identify the presence or absence of a particular
biomarker. This paper seeks to provide a theoretical and experimental basis for
understanding these conflicting results.
Given the complexity of targeting tumors in vivo, theoretical modeling becomes essential
for isolating the effects of individual parameters. Experimentally, the same antibody can be
used to target different tumors with varying expression, but this does not account for tumor
spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Likewise, the same tumor can be targeted with
antibodies against different antigens with varying expression, but this does not account for
differences in antibody pharmacokinetics. The theoretical model can be used to predict the
effect of antigen concentration on targeting, ceteris paribus, and the two types of
experiments can be compared to this ideal scenario.
In this report, we use a previously developed theoretical model and pharmacokinetic
analysis of antibody transport[8,21-24] to describe the conditions under which uptake is
predicted to be proportional to expression level and those where it is not. This model
describes antibody uptake for cell surface antigens present in solid tumors or liquid tumors
(e.g. lymphomas) when the cells are in a vascularized tumor. An experimental xenograft
model is used to test the specific hypothesis in vivo  under controlled conditions. When the
tumor is not saturated by antibody, uptake is limited by delivery, more specifically by
extravasation from the tumor vasculature. Under saturating conditions, delivery is sufficient
to supply antibody for all expressed antigen, and uptake is limited by the number of binding
sites. In the latter case, image intensity is proportional to antigen expression levels. These
considerations are critical when quantifying localization in vivo , since measurements may
report the concentration of the biomarker of interest or simply delivery of the probe to the
region.
Materials and Methods
Theoretical Model
The theoretical mathematical model to predict the distribution and uptake of antibodies in
vascularized tumors and micrometastases has been described previously[8,21-24]. Recently
it has been extended to other macromolecules and nanoparticles[25]. Briefly, for a
vascularized tumor, a Krogh cylinder setup is used where the plasma concentration in the
tumor capillaries follows a biexponential decay. Exchange between the plasma and tumor
interstitium is governed by the permeability of the tumor capillaries. Once outside the
vessel, the antibody is controlled by diffusion, binding, dissociation, and cellular
internalization rates. A prevascular metastasis is modeled as a sphere in a homogeneous
normal tissue compartment, where the surrounding concentration is governed by the
decaying plasma concentration, normal tissue capillary extravasation rate, and lymphatic
drainage rate. Once inside the metastasis, the same diffusion and molecular interaction rates
control distribution. It is important to note that while this model predicts the overall antibodyThurber and Weissleder Page 2
Mol Imaging Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 August 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptconcentration in tumors, it does not assume homogeneous uptake. The low Biot number for
macromolecules[24] enables the average uptake to be calculated without explicitly
examining the heterogeneous distribution in the tumor. It is also assumed that tumor uptake
is not sufficient to affect the plasma concentration (e.g. no TMDD)[26]. The model was used
to determine the sensitivity of various parameters in order to ensure measurement of the
most influential parameters. For example, plasma clearance (AUC) is expected to have a
significant impact on uptake, so the blood half life of both antibodies was measured to verify
it was similar for each. On the contrary, for high affinity antibodies (e.g. single digit
nanomolar Kd), the affinity is predicted to have little effect on uptake, and this has been
shown experimentally[27].
Antibodies
A mouse monoclonal anti-EpCAM antibody (clone# 158206, R&D Systems; Minneapolis,
MN) and chimeric anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (ImClone; Branchburg, NJ) were used for
the in vivo  experiments. The antibodies were labeled with either VivoTag 680 (VT680)
fluorophore (Visen; Bedford, MA) or Alexa Fluor 750 (AF750) fluorophore (Invitrogen;
Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. This resulted in approximately 2 VT680
dyes or 3 AF750 dyes per antibody. There was no statistically significant change in Kd upon
conjugation of the dyes as measured on HT-29 or A431 cells by flow cytometry. The
dissociation of cetuximab was subnanomolar, and the Kd of the anti-EpCAM fluorophore
conjugate was approximately 2 nM. Both these affinities were high enough that they should
have a negligible impact on targeting based on simulations.
Cell Lines and Animal Model
For the mouse tumor xenografts, HT-29 human colon cancer cells were grown in McCoy's
5A media with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 2% sodium bicarbonate, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Antigen expression levels were measured using quantitative beads
(Bangs Laboratories; Fishers, IN) per the manufacturer's instructions. The reported values
were measured in cell culture and verified in xenografts. For in vivo measurements,
xenograft tumors were digested and measured as described previously[8] to verify that in
vivo levels were similar to those measured in vitro . In addition, immunohistochemistry
showed intense EpCAM staining in the HT-29 tumors whereas adjacent sections showed
very low but still detectable EGFR staining (supplemental figure 1). Cells were diluted in
PBS, and 50 uL containing ∼1.5 million cells were injected subcutaneously in the back and
flank of female nu/nu mice (Cox-7, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). All
animal experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines from the Massachusetts
General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care. Tumors grew to approximately 5
mm in diameter after 2 weeks when they were used for experiments. The actual time varied
from 1 to 3 weeks in order to image tumors of the same size.
In vivo Experiments
Three days before imaging, mice were injected with 30 μg of anti-EpCAM and anti-EGFR
antibody (unless stated otherwise for the text). This dose was large enough to give a
significant signal relative to background autofluorescence but subsaturating according to the
theoretical model. Saturating doses were calculated using the mathematical model[24] with
the parameters listed in the tables. Experimental measurements were taken on 9 to 12 tumors
in mice. Antibodies were dissolved in 100 μL of PBS and delivered by tail vein injection
under isoflurane anesthesia. On the third day, the mice were anesthetized using 90 mg/kg
ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, the skin over the tumor and surrounding muscle was
removed to reduce scattering, and the mice were imaged in an OV110 epifluorescence
imaging system (Olympus; Center Valley, PA). The exposure time was set to 280 ms to use
the dynamic range of the camera without saturating the images, and the gain was set to zero,Thurber and Weissleder Page 3

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptwhich gave linear intensity curves of standardized control wells filled with fluorescent dye.
Image analysis was carried out using ImageJ (NIH) by drawing a region of interest around
each tumor and taking the average intensity. Tumor to background ratios were calculated
using the following equation:
where the autofluorescence signals were measured in uninjected mice. Means were
compared using Student's T-test for statistical significance using Prism (GraphPad; La Jolla,
CA).
To measure the plasma decay curves, blood samples were taken by retro-orbital puncture at
multiple time points using heparin coated capillary tubes, imaged on the OV110 at high
magnification, and compared to standards.
Results
A mathematical model capturing the transport steps of antibody uptake was used to simulate
a tumor with varying antigen expression levels. Estimates for these parameters can be
measured experimentally or taken from the literature[21]. Some of these parameters may
vary depending on the model, such as the internalization rate. Using this parameter as an
example, these rates often depend on the biology of the system, with clathrin coated pit
uptake being faster than constitutive membrane turnover, which is faster than proteins
associated with tight junctions[22,28]. Utilizing these estimates takes full advantage of the
predictive capabilities of the model, while the parameters can be measured individually if
the results differ significantly from predictions. With all other variables held constant (e.g.
dose, antibody plasma clearance, antigen internalization rate, tumor vascularization, cell
density, time after injection, etc.), the concentration of antibody in the tumor was plotted
versus antigen concentration. At low expression levels, the concentration was proportional
to the antigen expression level when all available binding sites were occupied (figure 1A).
As the antigen expression goes to zero, the tumor concentration does not drop to zero but
rather to a lower level as a result of non-specific poor extravasation and intravasation rates
of macromolecules, often described as enhanced permeation and retention (EPR)[29]. At
higher expression levels, the amount of antibody reaching the tumor was limited by
extravasation across the vascular wall, and uptake concentrations plateaued. At this point,
there were more available binding sites than antibodies that reached the tumor, and the
concentration was dependent on delivery. Two fundamental dimensionless numbers describe
when saturation is reached in the tumor, and both these numbers must be less than unity for
saturation to occur[22].
To test the prediction that antigen expression level has a minimal impact on high affinity
antibodies at subsaturating concentrations, two different antigens were targeted in the same
tumor. Since the plateau concentration is highly dependent on tumor vascularization and
permeability, which can vary widely between tumors, this allowed delivery to a highly
expressed and moderately expressed target by the same vessels in the same tumor over an
identical time period. The expression of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) and epithelial cell
adhesion molecule (EpCAM) varies in magnitude in HT-29 human colon cancer cells. While
EGFR is moderately expressed (38,000 EGFR/cell), EpCAM is highly expressed (2.3
million EpCAM/cell) as seen with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry
(supplemental). Even with this 50-fold difference in expression, a subsaturating dose of
antibody is predicted to localize to a similar extent in both tumors (Figure 1B). This modelThurber and Weissleder Page 4
Mol Imaging Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 August 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptsystem was chosen since this constitutes one of the largest differences in expression where
similar uptake can be demonstrated with fluorescent antibodies. (Antigens are rarely
expressed at levels higher than several million antigens per cell, and it is difficult to achieve
signals larger than background with cells expressing less than a few thousand targets.) The
anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab conjugated to AF750 and an anti-EpCAM antibody
conjugated to VT680 were injected via tail vein 3 days before imaging at a dose of 30 μg
each per mouse. Although mouse antibodies are typically cleared more slowly than human
antibodies in a mouse, the measured clearance (AUC) was similar for these two antibodies
(supplemental). This is likely due to increased clearance of the mouse antibody in the liver
and spleen of nude mice for this antibody isotype[30]. While the isotype can change the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (e.g. through FcRn and Fc γ receptor interactions),
these antibodies were chosen since they resulted in a similar plasma area under the curve
(AUC), which has a strong influence on uptake[5]. After removing the skin covering the
tumor to reduce scattering, epifluorescence images were taken of the tumors. HT-29 cells
grow as clusters of tumor cells surrounded by host macrophages and vasculature[8]. The
uptake pattern of both antibodies in these cell clusters on the macroscopic scale was
qualitatively similar (Figure 1C).
To quantify the uptake of these antibodies, region of interest analysis was done on all the
tumors, and the average fluorescence intensity was measured. The intensity of both
antibodies was similar in the first group of mice. However, image intensity is dependent on a
large number of factors, including the intensity of the excitation light, filter specifications,
fluorophore absorption and quantum efficiency, tissue scattering and absorption, and
sensitivity of the camera to different wavelengths. To rule out effects based on the
fluorophores, the fluorescent tags were switched and the experiment repeated. The
intensities of the regions of interest were not significantly different between the two
antibodies when labeled with the same probe even in different groups of mice (Figure 2).
Control experiments with a dilution series of the free dye resulted in 37.5 MFU/nM of
VT680 dye and 33.3 MFU/nM of AF750 dye. Differences in tissue depth and scattering
prevent precise quantification of concentrations, but these results indicate the antibody
tumor concentrations are on the order of 50-100 nM and slightly higher for VT680 than
AF750.
Theoretical models[8,24] indicate similar uptake between the two antibodies would be
obtained at subsaturating doses. However, when one or both of the tumors are saturated,
antibody uptake for the more highly expressed EpCAM is predicted to be higher than for
EGFR. Using parameter estimates for the pertinent rates in uptake (table 1), it was possible
to estimate the doses required for saturation. Using estimates of the Thiele modulus and
Clearance modulus, it was calculated that a 5-fold increase in dose (150 μg dose) would still
be subsaturating for the anti-EpCAM antibody but would saturate all the EGFR binding sites
(table 2). In theory, a 150 μg blocking dose of non-fluorescent antibody (administered a day
before the imaging dose of fluorescent antibody) should have no effect on the total uptake of
anti-EpCAM antibody since there are still many free binding sites remaining. However, this
same dose should bind all the EGFR in the tumor, reducing the amount of anti-EGFR uptake
(Figure 3A). This same principle can be applied to humans, but the doses are much larger.
Table 3 calculates typical doses needed to saturate a tumor in a 70-kg man with varying
expression levels (supplemental).
Mice bearing HT-29 tumors identical to the first two groups were administered 150 μg of
non-fluorescent anti-EGFR antibody and 150 μg of non-fluorescent anti-EpCAM antibody
on day 1. On day 2, these mice received 30 μg of anti-EpCAM-VT680 and anti-EGFR-
AF750, and three days after the fluorescent antibody (day 5), the mice were imaged. TheThurber and Weissleder Page 5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptanti-EpCAM antibody yielded bright fluorescence in the clusters of tumor cells. However,
the intensity of the anti-EGFR antibody was reduced, and the labeling pattern was different
(Figure 3B). Rather than high uptake in the tumor cell clusters, the residual fluorescence was
slightly more intense in the region surrounding the tumor clusters, a compartment previously
shown to consist primarily of macrophages[8].
Quantifying the tumor to background ratio using region of interest analysis, the TBR did not
change significantly for the anti-EpCAM antibody with or without a preblocking dose of
non-fluorescent antibody. The TBR of the anti-EGFR antibody was significantly reduced,
however, indicating a lack of free, accessible binding sites within the tumor (Figure 4).
During the subcutaneous injection of tumors, some cells often leak out along the needle
track, forming small ‘micrometastases.’ Delivery to these small tumor clusters is better in
theory due to their large surface area to volume ratios and diffusion from the surrounding
normal tissue (Fig 5A). The concentration of IgG in normal tissue interstitium has been
measured around 25-50% of that found in the plasma[31,32]. Uptake from the normal tissue
is proportional to the tumor radius and antibody diffusion coefficient (D/R tumor2) rather than
the permeability surface area product (PS/V) from antibody in the vessels. Localization of
anti-EpCAM antibody in these small tumors is very high, consistent with significant
delivery by the surrounding normal tissue. While delivery of the anti-EGFR antibody to the
small tumor is presumably the same as anti-EpCAM antibody, the number of binding sites is
far fewer, resulting in antibody diffusing back out of the metastasis and lower overall uptake
(Figure 5B). Although the concentration of anti-EGFR antibody in the small tumor is
predicted to be similar to anti-EGFR antibody in the large tumor, the much thicker large
tumor gives a stronger signal intensity at similar concentrations. Simulations of a spherical
tumor imbedded in normal tissue show a high but heterogeneous uptake of anti-EpCAM
antibody around the tumor periphery, where the large number of binding sites immobilize
the antibody near the surface. The fewer number of binding sites allows the anti-EGFR
antibody to reach the center, albeit at a lower concentration. Some of this antibody is able to
diffuse back out of the small tumor, and uptake is much lower in the saturated EGFR small
tumor than with anti-EpCAM antibody (Figure 5C). This surface uptake becomes
diminishingly important for tumors larger than about 1 mm (supplemental figure 2).
Discussion
Tumor targeting of antibodies is a complex process with many steps that have varying rates
within and between tumors. Not surprisingly, given the diversity of tumor expression levels,
antibody properties, and tumor types, some experimental results indicate a correlation
between antibody uptake and antigen expression, while other papers report no correlation.
By analyzing the fundamental steps in transport including blood flow, extravasation,
diffusion, and binding relative to plasma clearance and local clearance from internalization,
predictions can be made on the overall targeting and distribution of these antibodies. These
theoretical models indicate that high affinity antibody uptake is not correlated with antigen
expression unless all the binding sites in the tumor are occupied. This is especially important
for the interpretation of imaging data, since signal intensity could wrongly be attributed to
antigen expression levels depending on the experimental or clinical conditions.
The theoretical results can be explained based on the rates of antibody transport. The time
scale for exchange of these macromolecules across the vascular wall is hours, but it only
takes minutes to diffuse the distance between blood vessels and seconds to bind antigen[21].
Antibodies that extravasate out of the tumor vasculature therefore have time to diffuse to
unbound antigen and associate before intravasating back into the blood. As long as there are
free binding sites available in the tumor, these antibodies will be immobilized in the tissue.Thurber and Weissleder Page 6
Mol Imaging Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 August 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptTherefore, under subsaturating conditions, the localization of antibodies is limited by
extravasation across the blood vessel wall. The anti-EGFR and anti-EpCAM antibodies
localized to a similar extent in the HT-29 tumors even though their expression differed by
over an order of magnitude. An alternative (but equally valid) conceptualization is that
figure 1a represents an in vivo  saturation curve. Given a constant dose and equal delivery
(vascularization and permeability), a fixed amount of antibody reaches the tumor. As the
number of antigens per cell increases, more of this antibody binds the target and is retained.
Once the number of targets exceeds the number of antibodies that reach the tumor, the
uptake is no longer dependent on the amount of antigen. This saturation curve is the reverse
of what is typically done in vitro , where the antibody concentration is varied until a fixed
amount of antigens (i.e. cells) are saturated.
It is important to note that despite the increased permeability of tumor blood vessels, the
permeability still limits uptake of these macromolecules in tumors. The permeability of
tumor blood vessels is high relative to normal vessels due to the effects of VEGF and other
growth factors[33,34]. However, the rate at which antibodies cross the blood vessel wall (the
permeability) is low relative to the other steps in targeting (tumor blood flow, interstitial
diffusion, and binding) implicating the permeability as the rate limiting step in uptake. These
relative rates emphasize the need for quantitative models to describe uptake, since
statements on ‘high’ and ‘low’ permeability are context dependent. Even though the signal
is limited by delivery at subsaturating concentrations, it is still antigen dependent. The lower
uptake of a non-binding antibody (or tumor that lacks binding sites) is often used to show
specificity. Using a functional definition of saturation, where saturation is the lack of
accessible, unoccupied binding sites in the tumor, a non-binding antibody is always
‘saturated.’ This runs counter to traditional thinking where this type of antibody would never
saturate a tumor, but it agrees with the theoretical and experimental results. The Thiele
modulus and clearance modulus, which must be less than one for saturation, are identically
zero with no antigen. As the antigen concentration approaches zero in figure 1a, the
antibody concentration approaches the EPR level of a non-binding antibody.
Experimentally, the anti-EGFR antibody in figure 3b distributed similar to a non-binding
antibody injected in these tumors (supplemental figure 3). Both of these antibodies in the
‘saturated’ regime lacked free accessible binding sites.
Using a theoretical model of tumor saturation, the saturating dose of antibody was calculated
for both antigens in these tumors. By choosing a dose in between the levels for these
antibodies, the lower expression antigen was saturated while the higher expressing antigen
retained free binding sites. This demonstrates the quantitative nature of the model, since too
low of a dose wouldn't affect either antigen, while too high of a dose would affect both
antigens. In order to saturate a highly expressed antigen, a much larger dose is needed. To
saturate EGFR on A431 cells that express several million receptors per cell, Li et al. used a 1
mg dose of antibody per mouse to block the sites and reduce uptake[1]. Similarly, McLarty
et al. used a 0.8 mg dose to saturate HER2 expressed at half a million receptors per cell. The
corollary is presented in this paper, where a 0.15 mg dose was not sufficient to saturate
EpCAM in HT-29 cells. Localization of the anti-EGFR antibody was reduced when the mice
received a saturating dose; however, the tumor to background ratio was still above two.
Some of this uptake may be from the high rates of permeability and lack of efficient
lymphatic drainage in the tumor (the enhanced permeability and retention, or EPR effect).
Based on the overall distribution of this antibody, a fraction also colocalizes with
macrophages in the stromal tissue and surrounding tumor capsule. The relative contribution
of fluid phase uptake or binding to Fc receptors on the surface of these cells is not known.
There were some fluorophore specific effects on signal concentration in the tumors studied
here. Although the different antigen internalization rates were accounted for in the modelThurber and Weissleder Page 7
Mol Imaging Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 August 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript(table 1), the cellular loss of the tag can dominate the loss of signal if this is much slower
than the internalization rate (supplemental section 7). Estimating tumor concentrations based
on the number of fluorophores per antibody and the signal intensity from calibrated control
solutions, the concentration of VT680 fluorophore was double to triple that of the AF750
fluorophore, independent of the antibody used for localization. While the precise mechanism
for this difference is not known, in vitro  experiments indicate that the VT680 dye is trapped
within the cells for a longer period of time following internalization (data not shown).
Similar to the residualizing nature of some radioisotopes, fluorophores that are trapped
inside cells for longer times will yield a higher signal[35]. Antibodies labeled with
indium-111, for example, give a higher signal than those labeled with iodine, which is able
to escape cells at a faster rate following internalization and catabolism[36]. Since
background signal is likely from free antibody while the tumor signal contains a significant
portion of internalized and degraded antibody, the cellular retention rate preferentially
affects the tumor signal over background. This mechanism is consistent with the higher
tumor to background ratios found with VT680 labeled antibodies over AF750 labeled
antibodies in figure 4 and explains why the model is not very sensitive to the different
antigen internalization rates in these experiments.
These results help clarify differences in correlations between uptake and antigen expression
in the literature. With low extravasation rates in tumors relative to the number of binding
sites, subsaturating doses of antibody are often used with imaging. In these instances, uptake
is not proportional to expression level but related to delivery by the vasculature[20,37]. The
number of binding sites of a particular antigen can vary by orders of magnitude, with some
of the highest expressing cells containing several million binding sites per cell. However,
other lines express much lower levels, and if these targets are chosen, saturating doses can
more easily be achieved. Cai et al. showed a linear correlation between expression levels
and uptake, possibly indicating some of these tumors were saturated.
An important paper by McLarty et al.[17] used several cell lines with varying HER2
expression to measure uptake as a function of antigen density. Their results showed an
overall non-linear uptake curve as a function of antigen density. Their experimental data
look similar to the theoretical trend in figure 1a of this paper, demonstrating a near linear
correlation at low expression levels but little dependence at high expression levels. To
obtain this curve, the authors had to normalize their data to uptake of a non-specific
antibody, effectively normalizing the variable delivery (vascularization and permeability)
between the different cell lines. To make a more robust comparison of our model predictions
to experimental data with variable target expression, we not only used the same cell line
(which could have been achieved by varying transfection levels) but also the same tumor.
This eliminates any inter-tumor differences in vascularization, permeability, blood flow,
diffusion, etc. and enables multichannel imaging of targeted antigens with high and low
expression in a single tumor. Therefore, we were required to choose different targets in the
tumor. Neither experiments with different cell lines and tumors or with different antibodies
can completely isolate the effects of antigen expression, which is why theoretical modeling
is imperative. However, both studies using the same antibody and different tumors[17] and
the current data with the same tumor and different antibodies are consistent with the model
predictions.
For human studies, the model predicts very large doses are required for saturation, on the
order of hundreds of milligrams to grams (table 3). These values were obtained using
estimates of biological parameters or values (such as antigen expression and plasma
clearance) measured in the clinic. With therapeutic antibodies, doses are given repeatedly
maintaining an elevated plasma level over an extended period of time, but several mg/kg are
required to overcome the slow extravasation and catabolism in tumor tissue. In general,Thurber and Weissleder Page 8
Mol Imaging Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 August 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptthese doses are high enough for saturation. Imaging agents are given as a single dose, and
saturation is not necessary for sufficient tumor to background ratios. For radiolabeled
antibodies, doses are well below saturation, and even optical agents such as for FILM are
not saturating in most scenarios. Under these conditions, overall uptake in the tumor is not
related to antigen expression.
Important information can be obtained from the small tumors along the needle track. There
are multiple mechanisms for higher uptake near the surface of tumors. Since the local
vascular surface area determines the delivery to a particular region, large tumors with central
necrosis will have little antibody in their center[38,39]. There is also the possibility of higher
effective permeability in vessels near the surface due to lower interstitial pressure in this
region[40]. Both these mechanisms require vascularized tumors, however, and it does not
appear there are any vessels in the 500-700 um diameter tumor in Figure 5. Uptake in this
tumor results from diffusion from the surrounding normal tissue. The large number of
binding sites immobilizes the antibody at the surface, and over time the binding site front
moves towards the center[23]. With lower expression levels of EGFR, the metastasis was
saturated with this antibody. The absolute number of binding sites in this small lesion is low
and difficult to visualize against the background autofluorescence, which is highly relevant
in tumor targeting for surgical resection. The same distribution pattern is expected around
the blood vessels in the large tumor, with the high expression levels immobilizing the anti-
EpCAM antibody in a perivascular distribution while the anti-EGFR is able to penetrate
farther away from the vessels due to fewer binding sites in the tissue. The scattering of the
tissue prevents this from being seen by epifluorescence in the large tumors, but qualitatively,
the distribution of the anti-EpCAM antibody is more punctate near the surface with the anti-
EGFR antibody resulting in more diffuse localization (supplemental figure 4).
It is important to note that these results are valid for high affinity antibodies. Lower affinity
antibodies have a larger fraction unbound in the tumor, allowing them to intravasate at a rate
depending on the local antigen concentration. This assumption is not as limiting as it first
appears. Since IgG molecules are bivalent, even if the intrinsic affinity is low, the valency
often causes rebinding before the molecule completely dissociates, so it functions as a high
affinity antibody[41].
These results have important implications for therapy and imaging. For therapy, this
indicates these smaller metastases are more easily targeted than vascularized tumors. This is
an additional but distinct mechanism (diffusion from the metastasis surface) from other size
dependencies, such as the extent of vascularization[42]. For imaging applications such as
fluorescent intraoperative live microscopy[8], the expression level will determine the size of
tumors that are visible. While moderate expression is sufficient to detect larger tumors (e.g.
several mm to cm in diameter) for surgical debulking[43], high expression is required to
detect smaller micrometastatic deposits such as the small lesion in figure 5 for complete
resection. The saturation doses in table 3 are similar to therapeutic doses used in the clinic
but are impractically large for nuclear medicine imaging applications where the smallest
possible dose is often desired. To circumvent this problem, either therapies must be able to
reduce the expression level until the imaging agent is capable of saturating the antigen for
measurements[3,44] or other mechanisms of quantification must be developed. This
experimental demonstration of the theoretical predictions support the use of quantitative
modeling in the design of more efficacious treatments[25] and timely quantitative imaging
agents.

Abstract
Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are found in the sera of many HIV-1–infected 
individuals, but the virologic basis of their neutralization remains poorly understood. We used 
knowledge of HIV-1 envelope structure to develop antigenically resurfaced glycoproteins specific 
for the structurally conserved site of initial CD4 receptor binding. These probes were used to 
identify sera with NAbs to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) and to isolate individual B cells from 
such an HIV-1–infected donor. By expressing immunoglobulin genes from individual cells, we 
identified three monoclonal antibodies, including a pair of somatic variants that neutralized over 
90% of circulating HIV-1 isolates. Exceptionally broad HIV-1 neutralization can be achieved with 
individual antibodies targeted to the functionally conserved CD4bs of glycoprotein 120, an 
important insight for future HIV-1 vaccine design.
Having crossed from chimpanzees to humans in only the past century, HIV-1 has rapidly 
evolved a daunting degree of diversity, posing a considerable challenge for vaccine

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptdevelopment. The definition of naturally occurring broadly neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) 
has proven elusive, and the ability to target conserved determinants of the viral envelope 
(Env) has proven difficult ( 1, 2). During HIV-1 infection, almost all individuals produce 
antibodies to Env, but only a small fraction can neutralize the virus ( 1, 2). Recently, several 
groups have shown that the sera of 10 to 25% of infected participants contain broadly 
reactive NAbs ( 3–6), including some sera that neutralize the majority of viruses from diverse 
genetic subtypes ( 5–7). NAbs react with the HIV-1 Env spike, which is composed of three 
heavily glycosylated glycoprotein (gp)120 molecules, each noncovalently associated with a 
transmembrane gp41 molecule. To initiate viral entry into cells, the gp120 binds to the cell 
surface receptor CD4 ( 8). We previously reported that selected sera contain NAbs directed 
against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) of gp120 ( 7, 9), and we defined the structure of the 
CD4bs in complex with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) b12 ( 10, 11). Antibody 
b12 was isolated from a phage display library in 1992 and can neutralize about 40% of 
known HIV-1 isolates ( 12–14). The more recently isolated CD4bs mAb HJ16 also 
neutralizes about 40% of viral isolates ( 15). Attempts to isolate more broadly reactive 
CD4bs-directed NAbs from human B cells have not met with success, in part because the 
gp120 or gp140 proteins used were reactive with many HIV-1–specific antibodies, including 
nonneutralizing antibody specificities ( 15, 16). In this study, we used our knowledge of Env 
structure, together with computer-assisted protein design, to define recombinant forms of 
HIV-1 Env that specifically interact with NAb directed to the CD4bs. These Env probes were 
used to identify and sort individual B cells expressing CD4bs antibodies, enabling the 
selective isolation of CD4bs-directed mAbs with extensive neutralization breadth.
To generate a molecule that preserved the antigenic structure of the neutralizing surface of 
the CD4bs but eliminated other antigenic regions of HIV-1, we designed proteins whose 
exposed surface residues were substituted with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 
homologs and other non–HIV-1 residues ( 17) (Fig. 1A and fig. S1). These changes were 
conferred on a core gp120 and a stabilized core gp120, both of which retained the major 
contact surface for CD4 located on its outer domain ( 10, 11, 18). The gp120 core lacked 
variable regions 1 to 3 and part of the amino and carboxy termini of the full gp120 molecule, 
and the stabilized core contained cross-links between different subregions of the core 
protein. Eight resurfaced proteins were designed and expressed, together with CD4bs 
mutants that served as negative controls by eliminating binding to the neutralizing mAb b12. 
Three resur-faced core Envs retained strong reactivity with b12 and mAb 2G12 (fig. S2), the 
latter of which recognizes a surface glycan epitope and served as a positive control for a 
conformationally intact protein. The resurfaced stabilized core 3 (RSC3) was chosen as the 
preferred candidate for further studies, because a greater percentage of its surface other than 
the outer domain CD4bs area was altered compared with the other variants (fig. S2). The 
conformational integrity and specificity of the RSC3 protein was confirmed by using a panel 
of known mAbs (table S1). As expected, RSC3 displayed strong reactivity to mAb b12 and 
little or no reactivity to a CD4 fusion protein (Fig. 1, B and C) ( 19). RSC3 also reacted with 
two weakly neutralizing CD4bs mAbs, b13 and m18, but it displayed no reactivity to four 
CD4bs mAbs that do not neutralize primary HIV-1 isolates, nor with mAbs directed to other 
regions of the HIV-1 Env, including the coreceptor-binding region of gp120 and the V3 and 
C5 regions of gp120 (table S1). ΔRSC3, which lacked a single amino acid at position 371 Wu et al. Page 2

analyses of sera and to identify B cells from an HIV-1–infected individual whose sera 
contained broadly reactive NAbs.
We screened a panel of broadly neutralizing sera for the presence of antibodies that could 
preferentially bind to RSC3 compared with ΔRSC3. CD4bs antibodies were detected in 
several sera, including serum from donor 45, which was previously reported to contain NAbs 
directed to the CD4bs of gp120 (fig. S3) ( 7). To determine whether antibodies that bind to 
RSC3 were responsible for the broad neutralization mediated by serum 45, we performed 
neutralization studies by using RSC3 to compete cognate antibodies. The utility of this assay 
was confirmed with the CD4bs mAb b12 and with mAb F105, which binds differently to the 
CD4bs and does not bind RSC3 (table S1). mAb b12 neutralizes many primary HIV-1 
strains, whereas F105 neutralizes mainly laboratory-adapted or other highly sensitive virus 
strains, such as the HXB2 strain used here. The addition of RSC3 but not ΔRSC3 inhibited 
b12-mediated neutralization of HXB2. RSC3 had no effect on F105 neutralization, and 
neither RSC3 nor ΔRSC3 affected neutralization by the anti-V3 mAb 447-52D (Fig. 1D). To 
interrogate serum 45 neutralization, we performed similar RSC3 competition studies with 
this serum against a panel of diverse HIV-1 strains (Fig. 1E). This analysis suggested that 
serum 45 neutralization was principally directed against the CD4bs on functional viral 
spikes and that the RSC3 faithfully mimicked this structure.
To isolate CD4bs-directed mAbs, we used a recently described method of antigen-specific 
memory B cell sorting ( 16), together with single-cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to 
amplify immunoglobulin G (IgG) heavy- and light-chain genes from the cDNA of individual 
B cells ( 16, 20). RSC3 and ΔRSC3 were expressed with a tagged amino acid sequence that 
allows biotin labeling. The two proteins could thus be distinguished by fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis after labeling with streptavidin (SA) conjugated to the 
fluorochromes allophycocyanin (SA-APC) or phycoerythrin (SA-PE), respectively. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from donor 45 were incubated with RSC3 SA-
APC and DRSC3 SA-PE, and single antigen-specific memory B cells were sorted into wells 
of a microtiter plate after selecting for memory B cells (CD19+, CD20+, and IgG+) that 
bound to the RSC3 but not the ΔRSC3 probe (Fig. 2A). Out of about 25 million PBMC, 29 
single RSC3-specific memory B cells were sorted, and the matching heavy- and light-chain 
genes were successfully amplified from 12 cells. After cloning into IgG1 expression vectors 
that reconstituted the heavy- and light-chain constant regions, the full IgG mAbs were 
expressed. Three antibodies (VRC01, VRC02, and VRC03) bound strongly to RSC3 and 
weakly or not at all to ΔRSC3 (Fig. 2, B, left, and C, and fig. S4). To confirm the specificity 
of these antibodies for the CD4bs, we tested enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
binding of each mAb against a wild-type gp120 and the CD4bs-defective Asp368→Arg368 
(D368R) mutant (Fig. 2B, right). VRC01 and VRC02 bound with ≥100-fold lower relative 
affinity to the heavy chain variable gene (VH) D368R mutant compared with wild-type 
gp120, and VRC03 showed no detectable binding to the CD4bs knockout mutant. The 
ELISA binding profile to an extended panel of mutant Env proteins further confirmed the 
CD4bs specificity of VRC01, VRC02, and VRC03 (table S1).Wu et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAnalysis of the heavy- and light-chain nucleotide sequences using JoinSolver software 
(http://joinsolver.niaid.nih.gov/ ) and the Immunogenetics Information System (IMGT) 
database ( http://imgt.cines.fr/ ) revealed that VRC01 and VRC02 were somatic variants of 
the same IgG1 clone. The heavy-chain CDR3 region of both mAbs was composed of the 
same 14 amino acids (fig. S5), and both mAbs were highly somatically mutated, with 32% 
of the heavy chain variable gene (VH) and 17 to 19% of the kappa light chain variable gene 
(VK) nucleotides divergent from putative germline gene sequences. VRC03 was potentially 
derived from a different IgG1 clone, but its heavy chain was derived from the same 
IGHV1-02*02 and IGHJ1*01 alleles as VRC01 and VRC02. VRC03 was also highly 
somatically mutated, with an unusual seven–amino acid insertion in heavy-chain framework 
3 and 30% of VH and 20% of VK nucleotides divergent from putative germline gene 
sequences. The heavy-chain CDR3 of VRC03 contained 16 amino acids. All three mAbs 
share common sequence motifs in heavy-chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3.
The binding characteristics of the mAbs were further analyzed by surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR), competition ELISA, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). SPR 
demonstrated that VRC01 ( KD = 3.88 × 10–9 M) and VRC02 ( KD = 1.11 × 10–8 M) bound 
gp120 with high affinity whereas VRC03 reacted with about 10-fold lower affinity ( KD = 
7.31 × 10–8 M) (fig. S4). To evaluate the epitope reactivity of these mAbs on gp120, we 
performed competition ELISAs with a panel of well-characterized mAbs. As expected, 
binding by all three VRC mAbs was competed by CD4bs mAbs b12 and F105 and by CD4-
Ig (Fig. 3A left and fig. S6A). Unexpectedly, the binding of mAb 17b to its site in the 
coreceptor binding region of gp120 was markedly enhanced by the addition of VRC01 or 
VRC02 (Fig. 3A right). This enhancing effect was similar, although not as profound, as the 
known effect of CD4-Ig. In contrast, mAb b12 inhibited mAb 17b binding (Fig. 3A right), as 
previously shown ( 21). A similar enhancing result was observed for VRC01 in an assay that 
measures gp120 binding to its CCR5 coreceptor (fig. S6C). Thus, VRC01 and VRC02 act as 
partial CD4 agonists in their interaction with gp120, whereas VRC03 does not display this 
effect. Thermodynamic analysis by ITC provided data consistent with the ELISA results and 
demonstrated a change in enthalpy (–Δ H) associated with the VRC01-gp120 interaction that 
was similar to the interaction of CD4-Ig and gp120 (Fig. 3B), further demonstrating that 
VRC01 binding induced conformational changes in gp120. In contrast to the data for gp120 
binding, VRC01 did not enhance viral neutralization by mAb 17b (fig. S7). These data 
suggest that VRC01 and VRC02 partially mimic the interaction of CD4 with gp120. This 
may explain their broad reactivity, because essentially all HIV-1 isolates must engage CD4 
for cell entry.
The potency and breadth of neutralization by VRC01, VRC02, and VRC03, compared with 
those by b12 and CD4-Ig, were assessed on a comprehensive panel of Env pseudoviruses 
(Fig. 4 and table S2). These 190 viral strains represented all major circulating HIV-1 genetic 
subtypes (clades) and included viruses derived from acute and chronic stages of HIV-1 
infection ( 22, 23). VRC01 neutralized 91% of these viruses with a geometric mean value of 
0.33 μg/ml (Fig. 4 and table S2). The data for VRC02 were very similar (table S2). Of note, 
these mAbs were derived from an HIV-1 clade B–infected donor yet displayed neutralization 
activity against all genetic subtypes of HIV-1. VRC03 was less broad than VRC01 and 
VRC02, neutralizing 57% of the viruses (table S2) ( 24). In contrast, b12, also derived from a Wu et al. Page 4
Science . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 August 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptclade B-infected donor, neutralized 41% of viruses tested. Because VRC01 was derived 
from a donor whose sera was also broadly neutralizing, we assessed the relationship 
between the neutralization breadth and potency of serum 45 IgG and mAb VRC01. Among 
140 viruses tested, there was a significant association ( P = 0.005; Fisher's exact test) 
between the number of viruses neutralized by serum 45 IgG and the number neutralized by 
VRC01 (fig. S8A). Among the 122 viruses neutralized by both serum IgG and VRC01, there 
was a strong association ( P < 0.0001; Deming linear regression) between the neutralization 
potency of the serum IgG and the potency of VRC01 (fig. S8B). Therefore, although VRC01 
did not account for all serum 45 IgG neutralization, the VRC01-like antibody specificity 
largely accounts for the extensive breadth and potency of serum 45. These findings 
demonstrate that a focused B cell response can target a highly conserved region of the HIV-1 
Env in humans ( 25).
Other mAbs are able to neutralize HIV-1, but none has a profile of potency and breadth 
similar to VRC01 and VRC02 ( 1, 13, 14, 26, 27). Antibody 4E10 requires relatively high 
concentrations to neutralize primary strains of HIV-1 ( 13), and it neutralizes only 12% of 
Env-pseudoviruses at a concentration of less than 1 μg/ml ( 14). The well-characterized 
CD4bs mAb b12 ( 13, 14) and the more recently described HJ16 ( 15) are informative with 
respect to antigen recognition, but each display restricted breadth (~40% of HIV-1 strains). 
Recently, two broadly neutralizing somatic variant mAbs, PG16 and PG9, were isolated by 
high-throughput neutralization screening of B cell supernatants ( 14). The PG16 and PG9 
neutralized 73% and 79%, respectively, of viruses tested and recognized a glycosylated 
region of HIV-1 Env that is present on the native viral trimer, but this epitope is not well 
presented on gp120 or gp140.
VRC01 and VRC02 access the CD4bs region of gp120 in a manner that partially mimics the 
interaction of CD4 with gp120 ( 28). This observation may explain their impressive breadth 
of reactivity. The isolation of these mAbs from an HIV-1–infected donor and the 
demonstration that they neutralize the vast majority of HIV-1 strains by targeting the 
functionally conserved receptor binding region of Env provides proof of concept that such 
antibodies can be elicited in humans. The discovery of these mAbs provides new insights 
into how the human immune system is able to effectively target a vulnerable site on the viral 
Env.

The CD4 binding property of the core proteins would result in their binding to circulating CD4-
expressing cells, such as CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. Because this interaction would 
confound the selection of B cells expressing CD4bs IgG, we additionally sought to design proteins 
containing the majority of the CD4bs epitope surface that maintained b12 reactivity but that no 
longer bound to CD4. Specifically, computer-assisted modeling was used to alter the β20/21 region 
of gp120 that is required for CD4 binding but is not part of the b12-contact surface (fig. S1).

Additional studies using primary PBMC-derived viral isolates and PBMC as target cells confirmed that 
VRC01, VRC02, and VRC03 were able to neutralize replication-competent uncloned HIV-1 
isolates grown in primary T cells (table S3). We also tested the impact of VRC01 on the functional 
viral spike because VRC01 and VRC02, like CD4, showed the ability to alter the conformation of 
gp120 and enhanced binding of CD4-induced antibodies like 17b. Unlike CD4, however, VRC01 
did not promote the entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into CD4-negative cells, and it did not 
augment the neutralization potency of mAb 17b (fig. S7).

Our successful isolation of CD4bs mAbs with extensive neutralization breadth was likely due to 
several factors. Recent advances in high-throughput neutralization assays facilitated the 
identification of HIV-1 antisera containing broad NAbs ( 4–7, 29–32). Advances in serum epitope 
mapping technologies led us to understand that conserved regions of HIV-1 Env may be targeted 
by such NAbs ( 4, 7, 9, 30, 33–37). The atomic-level structure of gp120 ( 10, 38) and advances in 
computational modeling allowed development of the RSC probe pair that was used to identify and 
sort CD4bs antibody-secreting B cells. Because of the large repertoire of circulating antibodies 
against gp120, most of them nonneutralizing, the epitope selectivity conferred by the RSC3 
protein, together with use of the knock-out mutant, was likely important for the identification of 
the relatively rare memory B cells secreting NAbs to the CD4bs. Recently, the gp140 form of Env 
was used to identify HIV-1–specific B cells and study the repertoire of the antibody responses to 
the Env glycoprotein ( 16). Numerous unique antibodies were derived from each of six HIV-1–
infected donors, but no single mAb demonstrated broad and potent neutralization. The ability to Wu et al. Page 6

application. A similar epitope-specific approach could be used to isolate mAbs to sites of known 
structure from infectious disease pathogens, including tuberculosis and malaria, and can be applied 
to the identification of targets of autoimmunity or cancer therapy.

Unlike CD4, VRC01 and VRC02 do not appear to require interaction with the conformationally

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to identify and isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.,"Research Hypothesis:
The design of resurfaced glycoproteins specific for the structurally conserved site of initial CD4 receptor binding will enable the identification and isolation of broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4-binding site of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.

Research Proposal:
We propose to use our knowledge of HIV-1 envelope structure, together with computer-assisted protein design, to define recombinant forms of HIV-1 Env that specifically interact with neutralizing antibodies directed to the CD4-binding site. These Env probes will be used to identify and sort individual B cells expressing CD4-binding site antibodies, enabling the selective isolation of CD4-binding site-directed monoclonal antibodies with extensive neutralization breadth. The isolated monoclonal antibodies will be characterized for their binding characteristics, epitope specificity, and neutralization potency against a comprehensive panel of HIV-1 genetic subtypes. Additionally, we will investigate the potential of these monoclonal antibodies to mimic the interaction of CD4 with gp120 and induce conformational changes in gp120. This research will provide insights into how the human immune system effectively targets a vulnerable site on the viral Env and may contribute to the development of novel strategies for HIV-1 vaccine design."
"0123456789();: As of April 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), the causative agent of 
COVID-19, accounted for more than 143 million infec-tions and more than three million deaths worldwide
1. 
Virus genomic sequences are being generated and 
shared at an unprecedented rate, with more than one 
million SARS- CoV-2 sequences available via the Global 
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), per -
mitting near real- time surveillance of the unfolding 
pandemic2. The use of pathogen genomes on this scale 
to track the spread of the virus internationally, study 
local outbreaks and inform public health policy signi-
fies a new age in virus genomic investigations3. Further 
to understanding epidemiology, sequencing enables 
identification of emerging SARS- CoV-2 variants  and 
sets of mutations  potentially linked to changes in viral 
properties.
As highly deleterious mutations are rapidly purged, 
most mutations observed in genomes sampled from cir -
culating SARS- CoV-2 virions are expected to be either 
neutral or mildly deleterious. This is because although high- effect mutations that contribute to virus adaption 
and fitness do occur, they tend to be in the minority compared with tolerated low- effect or no-  effect ‘neu -
tral’ amino acid changes
4. A small minority of mutations 
are expected to impact virus phenotype in a way that confers a fitness advantage, in at least some contexts. 
Such mutations may alter various aspects of virus biol-ogy, such as pathogenicity, infectivity, transmissibility and/or antigenicity. Although care has to be taken not  
to confound mutations being merely present in grow-ing 
lineages  with mutations that change virus biology5, 
fitness- enhancing mutations were first detected to 
have arisen within a few months of the evolution of SARS- CoV-2 within the human population. For exam-
ple, the spike protein amino acid change D614G was noted to be increasing in frequency in April 2020 and to 
have emerged several times in the global SARS- CoV-2 
population, and the coding sequence exhibits a high 
dN/dS ratio , suggesting positive selection at the codon 
position 614 (refS6,7). Subsequent studies indicated that 
D614G confers a moderate advantage for infectivity8,9 Variants

Abstract | Although most mutations in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS- CoV-2) genome are expected to be either deleterious and swiftly purged or relatively 
neutral, a small proportion will affect functional properties and may alter infectivity, disease 
severity or interactions with host immunity. The emergence of SARS- CoV-2 in late 2019 was 
followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS- CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations, 
in the context of ‘variants of concern’, that impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS- CoV-2 variants by 
postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of correlates of protection is  
required to evaluate how this may impact vaccine effectiveness. Nonetheless, manufacturers  
are preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and antigenic changes in the global virus population is done alongside 
experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of mutations. In this Review, we summarize the 
literature on mutations of the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein, the primary antigen, focusing on their 
impacts on antigenicity and contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss them in 
the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets.

note have now arisen and are discussed in this Review, 
with particular focus on mutations affecting antigenicity.
The extent to which mutations affecting the anti-
genic phenotype of SARS- CoV-2 will enable variants 
to circumvent immunity conferred by natural infection or vaccination remains to be determined. However, 
there is growing evidence that mutations that change the antigenic phenotype of SARS- CoV-2 are circu-
lating and affect immune recognition to a degree that 
requires immediate attention. The spike protein medi-
ates attachment of the virus to host cell- surface recep-
tors and fusion between virus and cell membranes
11 
(Box  1). It is also the principal target of neutralizing anti-
bodies generated following infection by SARS- CoV-2 
(refS12,13), and is the SARS- CoV-2 component of both 
mRNA and adenovirus- based vaccines licensed for use 
and others awaiting regulatory approval14. Consequently, 
mutations that affect the antigenicity of the spike pro -
tein are of particular importance. In this Review, we explore the literature on these mutations and their antigenic consequences, focusing on the spike protein and antibody- mediated immunity, and discuss them in 
the context of observed mutation frequencies in global sequence datasets.
Spike mutations receiving early attention
The rate of evolution of SARS- CoV-2 from December 
2019 to October 2020 was consistent with the virus 
acquiring approximately two mutations per month in 
the global population15,16. Although our understanding 
of the functional consequences of spike mutations is 
rapidly expanding, much of this knowledge involves the 
reactive investigation of amino acid changes identified as rapidly increasing in frequency or being associated with unusual epidemiological characteristics. Following the 
emergence of D614G, an 
amino acid substitution  within 
the receptor- binding motif (RBM), N439K, was noted 
as increasing in frequency in Scotland in March 2020. 
Whereas this first lineage with N439K (designated B.1.141 with the Pango nomenclature system
17) quickly 
became extinct, another lineage that independently 
acquired N439K (B.1.258) emerged and circulated 
widely in many European countries18. N439K is note-
worthy as it enhances the binding affinity for the ACE2 
receptor and reduces the neutralizing activity of some 
monoclonal antibodies  (mAbs) and polyclonal antibod-
ies present in sera from people who have recovered from infection18. Another RBM amino acid change, 
Y453F — associated with increased ACE2- binding 
affinity19 — received considerable attention following 
its identification in sequences associated with infec-tions in humans and mink; most notably one lineage 
identified in Denmark and initially named ‘cluster 5’ (now B.1.1.298)
20. As of 5 November 2020, 214 humans 
infected with SARS- CoV-2 related to mink were all car -
rying the mutation Y453F21. The B.1.1.298 lineage also 
has Δ69–70, an amino- terminal domain (NTD) dele-
tion that has emerged several times across the global SARS- CoV-2 population, including in the second 
N439K lineage, B.1.258. Δ69–70 is predicted to alter the conformation of an exposed NTD loop and has been 
reported to be associated with increased infectivity
22.
Genomic analyses indicate a change in host environ-
ment and signatures of increased selective pressures 
acting upon immunologically important SARS- CoV-2 
genes sampled from around November 2020 (ref.23). This 
coincided with the emergence of variants with higher 
numbers of mutations relative to previous circulating 
variants. These lineages because of their association with increased transmissibility were named ‘variants of concern’ . They are defined by multiple convergent muta-tions that are hypothesized to have arisen either in the context of chronic infections or in previously infected 
individuals
24–29. In addition to understanding the trans-
missibility and pathogenicity of these emerging variants, it is crucially important to characterize their antigenicity 
and the level of cross- protection provided by infection by 
earlier viruses that are genetically and antigenically sim-ilar to the virus that first emerged in December 2019 and 
which is used in all of the current vaccine preparations. 
Information on how spike mutations affect antigenic profiles can be derived from structural studies, mutations identified in viruses exposed to mAbs or plasma con-
taining polyclonal antibodies, targeted investigations of 
variants using site- directed mutagenesis and deep muta-
tional scanning (DMS) experiments that systematically  
investigate the possibility of mutations arising.
Immunogenic regions of spike
Several studies have probed the antigenicity of the SARS-  CoV-2 spike protein by 
epitope mapping  
approaches, including solving the structure of the spike 
protein in complex with the antigen- binding fragment 
of particular antibodies13,30–32. Serological analyses of 
almost 650 individuals infected with SARS- CoV-2 
indicated that ~90% of the plasma or serum neutraliz-
ing antibody activity targets the spike receptor- binding 
domain (RBD)12. A relative lack of glycan shielding  may 
contribute to the immunodominance  of the RBD33. One 
study reported structural, biophysical and bioinformat-
ics analyses of 15 SARS- CoV-2 RBD- binding neutral -
izing antibodies31. Antibody footprints  were generated 
by structural analyses of the spike residues considering potential hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions 
with a mAb atom that were less than 4.0 Å. Structural 
analyses allowed the categorization of RBD- binding 
neutra  lizing antibodies into four classes 
(fIg.  1a,b): ACE2-   
blocking antibodies that bind the spike protein in the 
open conformation (class 1); ACE2- blocking antibodies Author addresses

The substitutions, insertions  
or deletions of one or more 
nucleotides in the virus rNA 
genome. Non- synonymous 
nucleotide substitutions in 
protein- coding sequence  
result in a change in amino acid (referred to as a substitution  
or replacement), whereas synonymous nucleotide 
substitutions do not change 
the amino acid.

dN/dS ratio
The ratio of non- synonymous 
mutations per non- synonymous 
site (dN) to synonymous mutations per synonymous site 
(dS), which is used to estimate 
the balance between neutral 
mutations, purifying selection 
and positive selection acting  
on gene or a specific codon.
Amino acid substitution
A change in a specific amino acid of a protein. This is caused 
by non- synonymous mutations. 
By convention, an amino acid substitution is written in the 
form N501Y to denote  
the wild- type amino acid  
(N (asparagine)) and the 
substituted amino acid  
(Y (tyrosine)) at site 501 in  
the amino acid sequence.
Monoclonal antibodies

by cloning a unique white blood cell, which usually has 
monovalent binding affinity for 
a specific epitope. Virus particles 
can be saturated with mAbs, 
and the structure can be solved 
to determine the antibody 
footprint or mAbs can be used 
to select for mutations that

the closed conformation (class 2); antibodies that do not 
block ACE2 and bind the RBD in both the open con-
formation and the closed conformation (class 3); and 
neutralizing antibodies that bind outside the ACE2 site 
and only in the open conformation (class 4)31. Within 
the RBD, RBM epitopes  overlapping the ACE2 site are 
immunodominant, whereas other RBD sites generate 
lower and variable responses in different individuals12.
Although the RBD is immunodominant, there is 
evidence for a substantial role of other spike regions in 
antigenicity, most notably the NTD13,30,34. Early struc-
tural characterization of NTD- specific antibodies 4A8 
(ref.32) and 4–8 (ref.13) revealed similar epitope locations 
towards the upper side of the most prominently protrud-
ing area of the NTD. Cryogenic electron microscopy was 
used to determine the antibody footprint of the neutral-izing antibody 4A8, and showed key interactions involv -
ing spike residues Y145, H146, K147, K150, W152, R246 
and W258 
(ref.32). epitope binning  of 41 NTD- specific 
mAbs led to the identification of six antigenic sites, one of which is recognized by all known NTD- specific 
neutralizing antibodies and has been termed the ‘NTD 
supersite’ , consisting of residues 14–20, 140–158 and 245–264 
(ref.30) (fIg.  1a,b). The mechanism of neutraliza-
tion by which NTD- specific antibodies act remains to be 
fully determined, although it may involve the inhibition of conformational changes or proposed interactions with auxiliary receptors such as DC- SIGN or L- SIGN
32,35. 
Relatively little is known of antigenicity in the S2 sub-
unit, with immunogenicity thought to be impeded by 
extensive glycan shielding36, and although both linear 
and cross- reactive conformational S2 epitopes have been 
described37,38, the biological significance of these is not 
yet known.
Spike RBD mutations and immune escape
Several studies have contributed to the current under -
standing of how mutations in the SARS- CoV-2 spike 
protein affect neutralization. These studies include traditional escape mutation work that identifies muta-tions that emerge in virus populations exposed to either mAbs
39 or convalescent plasma  containing polyclonal 
antibodies40,41; targeted characterization of particular 
mutations18,42; and wider investigations of either large 
numbers of circulating variants43 or all possible amino 
acid substitutions in the RBD39,44–46. For spike residues 
where mutations have been shown to influence poly-
clonal antibody recognition, the observation of an effect 
on either mAbs or plasma is indicated in fIg. 1b. For a 
smaller number of residues, escape mutations emerg-
ing in virus exposed to mAbs or polyclonal plasma have 
been described (‘mAb emerge’ and ‘plasma emerge’ in 
fIg. 1b).
In a DMS study, researchers assessed all possible 
single amino acid variants using a yeast- display system 
and detected variants that escape either nine neutraliz-ing SARS- CoV-2 mAbs
45 or convalescent plasma from 
11 individuals taken at two time points after infection39 
(shades of green in fIg.  1b). The resulting heat maps 
provide rich data on the antigenic consequence of RBD 
mutations, with the plasma escape mutations being of 
particular interest given that they impact neutraliza-tion by polyclonal antibodies of the kind SARS- CoV-2 
encounters in infections, with significant levels of immu-nity acquired through prior exposure or vaccination.  
Although significant interperson and intraperson hetero -
geneity in the impact of mutations on neutralization by polyclonal serum has been described, the mutations that reduce antibody binding the most occur at a relatively small number of RBD residues, indicating substantial 
immunodominance within the RBD
39.
Of all RBD residues for which substitutions affected 
recognition by convalescent sera, DMS identified E484 
as being of principal importance, with amino acid changes to K, Q or P reducing neutralization titres by more than an order of magnitude
39. E484K has also been 
identified as an escape mutation that emerges during 
exposure to mAbs C121 and C144 (ref.40) and convales-
cent plasma41, and was the only mutation described in 
one study as able to reduce the neutralizing ability of a combination of mAbs (REGN10989 and REGN10934) 
to an unmeasurable level
47. In an escape mutation study 
using 19 mAbs, substitutions at E484 emerged more 
frequently than at any other residue (in response to 
four mAbs), and each of the four 484 mutants identi-fied (E484A, E484D, E484G and E484K) subsequently conferred resistance to each of four convalescent sera 
tested
48. No other mAb- selected escape mutants escaped 
each of the four sera, although the mutations K444E, G446V , L452R and F490S escaped three of the four sera 
tested
48.
Mutations at position 477 of the spike protein 
(S477G, S477N and S477R) rank prominently among mAb escape mutations identified by one study, and the mutation S477G conferred resistance to two of the four sera tested
48. However, substitutions at 477 were not 
identified as being important in DMS with convales-
cent plasma39. The mutation N439K increases affinity 
for ACE2 (ref.19), is predicted to result in an additional 
salt bridge at the RBM–ACE2 interface and is thought to preferentially reduce the neutralization potential 
of plasma that already has low neutralizing activity
18. 
However, a DMS study39 did not find that the mutation Box 1 | Spike protein structure and function
As with other coronaviruses, the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS- Cov -2) into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike 
glycoprotein , which forms homotrimers on the surface of the virion. The SARS- Cov -2 
spike protein is highly glycosylated, with 66 potential N- glycosylation sites per 
trimer98,99 (fIg.  4a).The SARS- Cov -2 spike protein is post- translationally cleaved  
by mammalian furin into two subunits: S1 and S2 (fIg.  4a). The S1 subunit largely 
consists of the amino- terminal domain and the receptor- binding domain (RBD), and  
is responsible for binding to the host cell- surface receptor, ACe2, whereas the S2 
subunit includes the trimeric core of the protein and is responsible for membrane fusion 
(fIg.  4b). The presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary, which  
is unique within the subgenus Sarbecovirus, is important for infectivity and virulence100, 
with furin cleavage facilitating the conformational change required for receptor binding
50. The spike protein transiently undergoes conformational changes between a 
closed conformation and an open conformation in which a hinge- like movement raises 
the RBD50. The residues comprising the receptor- binding motif are revealed on the 
upright RBD, enabling binding to ACe2, which induces a progressively more open structure until a fully open, three- ACe2- bound structure is formed, initiating S2 
unsheathing and membrane fusion

Epitope mapping
experimental determination  
of the binding site, or epitope,  
of an antibody. Approaches 
include x- ray co- crystallography 
or cryogenic electron microscopy of an antigen–
antibody complex and the 
mapping of systematic 
mutations introduced by 
site- directed mutagenesis.
Glycan shielding
The process by which a virus can cloak underlying protein, 
impeding antibody binding. 
This is mediated by glycans, 
bulky sugar molecules that  
are covalently attached to amino acid side chains of  
the viral protein.
Immunodominance
The phenomenon by  
which the host immune response against a viral particle is mostly focused on  
a few antigens and mediated  
by potently neutralizing antibodies.
Antibody footprints
Amino acid residues of a  
3D folded protein that are targeted and contacted by  
a binding antibody.
Glycoprotein
A protein with oligosaccharide 
chains (glycans) covalently 
attached to amino acid  
side chains. Virus surface glycoproteins embedded in the 
membrane often have a role  
in interactions with host cells, including receptor binding,  
and are also commonly targeted by host antibodies.

0123456789();: N439K significantly alters neutralization by polyclonal 
antibodies in plasma, in contrast to previous studies 
that found that N439K reduced neutralization by mAbs 
and convalescent plasma18. One explanation for this 
inconsistency is that the mechanism of immune escape 
conferred by N439K is through increased ACE2 affinity 
rather than by directly affecting antibody epitope recog-nition and that perhaps the experimental design of the DMS study is less sensitive to detecting immune evasion 
mutations of this type.Spike NTD mutations and immune escape
In the NTD, most of the evidence for immune evasion 
focuses on a region centred at a conformational epitope 
consisting of residues 140–156 (N3 loop) and 246–260 
(N5 loop), which includes the epitope of the antibody 4A8
32 (fIg. 1, magenta). In studies that identified the 
emergence of antibody escape mutations in virus popu-
lations exposed to convalescent plasma, mutations were 
roughly evenly distributed between the RBD and the NTD

0123456789();: mutations in viruses exposed to convalescent plasma 
from two individuals, one of which selected for NTD 
mutations only (N148S, K150R, K150E, K150T, K150Q 
and S151P)40. This was despite the plasma being a source 
of the highly potent RBD- targeting mAb C144 (ref.40). 
NTD antibody escape mutations were not observed for 
the other samples of plasma investigated, and further -
more, the 148–151 mutants exhibited only marginal 
reductions in sensitivity to the plasma tested, indicat-ing individual immune responses may be differentially  
affected by mutations of RBD and NTD epitopes
40.
Deletions in the NTD have been observed repeatedly 
in the evolution of SARS- CoV-2 and have been described 
as changing NTD antigenicity30,41,42. One study identified 
four recurrently deleted regions (RDRs) within the NTD 
and tested five frequently observed deletions within these: 
Δ69–70 (RDR1), Δ141–144 and Δ146 (RDR2), Δ210 (RDR3) and Δ243–244 (RDR4)
42. Of the four RDRs, 
RDR1, RDR2 and RDR4 correspond to NTD loops N2, 
N3 and N5, whereas RDR3 falls between N4 and N5 in 
another accessible loop ( fIg.  2a, asterisk). Both RDR2 
deletions, Δ141–144 and Δ146, and Δ243–244 (RDR4) 
abolished binding of 4A8 (ref.42). Further evidence of 
the role of RDR2 deletions in immune escape was pro-vided by a study that describes the emergence of Δ140 
in SARS- CoV-2 co- incubated with potently neutralizing 
convalescent plasma, causing a fourfold reduction in neu-tralization titre
41. This Δ140 spike mutant subsequently 
acquired the E484K mutation, resulting in a further four -
fold drop in neutralization titre, and thus a two- residue change across the NTD and the RBD can drastically evade the polyclonal antibody response. The Δ140+E484K double mutant next acquired an 11- residue insertion in 
the NTD N5 loop between Y248 and L249, completely abolishing neutralization. This insertion, which also introduced a new glycosylation motif in the vicinity of RDR4, is predicted to alter the structure of the antigenic 
N3 and N5 NTD loops
41. This finding further demon-
strates the structural plasticity of the NTD and indicates that insertions and the acquisition of additional glyco-
sylation motifs in the NTD are further mechanisms in addition to deletion that lead to immune evasion. Other examples of mutations that impact the epitope–paratope 
interface indirectly include mutations in the signal pep-
tide region and at cysteine residues 15 and 136, which form a disulfide bond that ‘staples’ the NTD amino termi-nus against the galectin- like β- sandwich
30. Mutations at 
those sites (for example, C136Y and S12P , which alter the 
cleavage occurring between residues C15 and V16) have 
been shown to affect the neutralizing activity of several mAbs, likely disrupting the disulfide bond and therefore dislodging the supersite targeted by several antibodies
30.
Across the spike protein, some mutations that con-
fer escape to neutralizing mAbs have little impact on serum antibody binding
39,40,44, possibly because those 
mAbs are rare in polyclonal sera, targeting subdominant 
epitopes12,39,44. Escape mutations emerging in viruses 
exposed to convalescent plasma have been identified in both the NTD (ΔF140, N148S, K150R, K150E, K150T, 
K150Q and S151P) and the RBD (K444R, K444N, K444Q, V445E and E484K)
40,41 (fIg. 1b). Notably, muta -
tions emerging under selective pressure from convales-
cent plasma may be different from those selected by the 
most frequent mAb isolated from the same plasma40. 
Potentially, observed differences arise because muta-
tions selected by convalescent plasma facilitate escape 
from multiple mAbs. Fewer data on the antigenic effects of S2 mutations exist, though D769H has been described as conferring decreased susceptibility to neu-
tralizing antibodies
24. Residue 769 is positioned in a 
surface- exposed S2 loop, and D769H was found to arise, 
in linkage with Δ69–70, in an immunocompromised 
individual treated with convalescent plasma24.
Conformational epitopes in spike
To evaluate potential antigenicity across the spike pro -
tein, we analysed the protein using BEpro, a program 
for the prediction of conformational epitopes based 
on tertiary structure49. This approach calculates a 
structure- based epitope score, which approximates anti-
body accessibility for each amino acid position. For each residue, the calculated score accounts for the local pro-tein structure: half- sphere exposure measures and pro-
pensity scores each depend on all atoms within 8–16 Å of 
the target residue, with weighting towards closer atoms. Due to this aggregation, calculated scores are relatively insensitive to the effects of single amino acid substitu -
tions. Scores were calculated for the spike protein in both 
the closed conformation and the open conformation 
(fIg.  2). It has been estimated that ~34% of spike pro-
teins are closed and 27% are open (with the remainder  
in an intermediate form) following furin cleavage50. Fig. 1 | Neutralizing antibody classes defined by structural analyses and properties 
of spike protein residues. a | Amino acid residues of the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) spike protein are coloured according to the

conformation and the closed conformations) and red for class 4 (neutralizing antibodies that bind outside the ACE2 site and only in the open conformation). When residues belong to epitopes of multiple classes, priority colouring is given to antibodies that block ACE2 and bind the closed spike protein. The amino- terminal domain (NTD) supersite

where substitutions affect binding by antibodies in polyclonal human blood plasma or emerge as antibody escape mutations. The distance in angstroms to the ACE2- contacting 
residues that form the receptor- binding site (RBS) is shown in shades of orange; each 
residue is classified as having evidence for mutations affecting neutralization by either monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
40,43,47,48 or polyclonal antibodies in plasma from previously 
infected individuals (convalescent)39–41,43,48 or vaccinated individuals59 (‘mAb effect’ and 
‘plasma effect’, respectively). A subset of these residues has mutations described as emerging upon exposure (co- incubation) to mAbs
40,47,48 or plasma40,41 in laboratory 
experiments (‘mAb emerge’ and ‘plasma emerge’, respectively). When an observation includes a deletion, this is indicated by a red cross. Shades of green depict the results of deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments where yeast cells expressing RBD mutants are incubated with multiple samples of human convalescent plasma
39. The escape 
fraction (that is, a quantitative measure of the extent to which a mutation reduced polyclonal antibody binding) averaged across all amino acid substitutions at a residue (‘plasma average’) and the maximally resistant substitution (‘plasma max’) are indicated. DMS data on ACE2- binding affinity
19 are shown in shades of red or blue representing 
higher or lower ACE2 affinity, respectively. The mean change in binding affinity averaged across all mutations at each site (‘binding average’) and alternatively the maximally binding mutant (‘binding max’) is shown. Scores represent binding constants (Δ log

0123456789();: Scores rescaled between 0 and 1 are plotted for the closed 
conformation in fIg. 2a and are represented on the struc-
ture in fIg. 2b. A limitation of this approach is that it does 
not account for glycan shielding of residues and likely 
overestimates scores at the base of the ectodomain for 
residues closest to the carboxy terminus.
Comparisons with reporting of antibody footprints 
and the impact of mutations on antigenicity indicate 
that residues with mutations described as affecting 
recognition by mAbs or antibodies in convalescent plasma 
(fIg.  1b) tend to occur at residues with higher 
structure- based antibody accessibility scores compared 
with other residues belonging to epitope footprints and residues not implicated in antigenicity (Supplementary Fig, 1b). Notably, scores for residues with mutations 
described as affecting plasma antibody recognition are 
also slightly higher on average compared with those with mutations described as affecting mAbs only. Epitope scores are particularly high for residues with mutations 
described as emerging during exposure to convalescent 
plasma
40,41 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Experimental data 
on the emergence of mutations under selective pressure 
from polyclonal antibodies are relatively rare, although 
these trends for higher scores associated with such muta-tions indicate that information from structural analysis approaches of this kind can contribute to the ranking of 
residues at which substitutions are likely to impact the 
polyclonal antibody response.

0123456789();: Within the RBD, the two areas with high structure-   
based antibody accessibility scores for the closed spike 
structure ( fIg. 2a, peaks with consecutive residues with 
scores greater than 0.8) are centred at residues 444–447 and residues 498–500. These areas are represented as 
yellow patches near the centre of the top- down view of 
the spike structure in 
fIg.  2b. fIgure  2c shows that, in 
general, residues become more accessible and are likelier 
to form epitopes when the spike protein is in the open 
conformation, and this is especially true for the RBD, particularly for the upright RBD (
fIg. 2c, yellow). In the 
open form, residues close to the ACE2-  binding site (405, 
415, 416, 417 and 468) become much more exposed on both the upright RBD and the clockwise adjacent closed RBD (
fIg. 2c, green). The effect of mutations at these 
positions is likely to be greater for antibodies belonging 
to RBD class 1. Residues centred at 444–447 and 498–500  
maintain high scores on the upright RBD and are 
joined by residues in areas 413–417 and 458–465. The only RBD residues that become notably less accessible 
in the open spike structure are residues 476, 477, 478, 
586 and 487 of the closed RBD clockwise adjacent to the upright RBD, which become blocked by the upright RBD (
fIg. 2c, green). Several RBD- specific antibodies are 
able to bind only the open spike protein (RBD classes 1  
and 4 (ref.31)), and interestingly, it has been observed that 
D614G makes the spike protein more vulnerable to neu-
tralizing antibodies by increasing the tendency for the 
open conformation to occur51.
Within the NTD, the highest- scoring spike residues in  
the closed form belong to a loop centred at residues  
147–150, which each have scores greater than 0.9 ( fIg. 2a, 
yellow patch to the extreme right of the structure viewed 
from the side in fIg.  2b). This loop, known as the N3 
loop, is described as forming key interactions with the neutralizing antibody 4A8 
(ref.32). One study described 
the structure of five previously unmodelled, protruding NTD loops, denoting them N1–N5. In addition to N3, 
high- scoring residues (greater than 0.7) are found at 
positions 22–26 (N1), 70 (N2), 173–187 (N4), 207–213 (
fIg. 2a, asterisk) and 247–253 (N5). Structural analysis 
indicates NTD-  binding antibodies are likely able to bind 
epitopes when the spike protein is in either the closed conformation or open the conformation 
(fIg. 2c). Outside 
the NTD and the RBD, the highest- scoring residues are 
residues 676 and 689 (which lie on either side of the loop containing the S1–S2 furin cleavage site, which is disordered in both the open conformation and the closed conformation
50), 793–794, 808–812, 1,099–1,100 
and 1,139–1,146 (fIg.  2a). When the spike protein is in 
the open conformation, increased accessibility results 
in substantially higher potential epitope scores for S2  
residues centred at 850–854, which become more 
accessible on all three spike monomers (fIg.  2c), and 
residues 978–984, which become more accessible on  
the monomer anticlockwise adjacent to the upright RBD  
monomer ( fIg. 2c, blue).
Structural context of spike mutations
To assess the impact of spike mutations and their immuno-logical role in the global SARS- CoV-2 population, 
we combined structural analyses with the observed frequency of mutations in circulating variants 
(fIg.  3). 
Globally, the highest number of amino acid variants, 
mapped against the Wuhan- Hu-1 reference sequence 
(MN908947), are recorded at amino acid positions 
614, 222 and 18 (fIg.  4a) (among 426,623 high- quality 
sequences retrieved from the GISAID database on 
3 February 2021 and processed using CoV- GLUE). 
Residues at positions 614 and 222 have relatively low antibody access scores and are positioned ~50  Å 
from the RBS residues when the spike protein is in 
the open conformation 
(fIg.  3a,b). As mentioned ear -
lier, there is evidence indicating that D614G confers a moderate advantage for infectivity
8,9 and increases 
transmissibility10. The spike amino acid substitution 
with the second highest frequency is A222V , which is present in the 20A.EU1 SARS-  CoV-2 cluster (also des-
ignated lineage B.1.177). This lineage has spread widely 
in Europe and is reported to have originated in Spain
52. 
There is no evidence for a notable impact of A222V on 
virus phenotype (that is, infectivity and transmissibility), 
and so its increase in frequency is generally presumed to have been fortuitous rather than a selective advantage. The substitution L18F has occurred ~21 times in the 
global population
53 and is associated with escape from 
multiple NTD- binding mAbs30.
Among the 5,106 independent substitutions observed 
in the spike protein (Box  1), 161 are described as affecting 
recognition by mAbs or polyclonal antibodies in sera, of which 22 are present in more than 100 sequences. On 
average, variant frequency is higher at amino acid posi-tions where mutations are described as affecting anti-body recognition than at positions with no described 
substitutions of antigenic importance (Supplementary 
Fig. 1a), and high levels of amino acid substitutions are observed at some amino acid positions where mutations are described as affecting recognition by antibodies in 
convalescent plasma, including positions 439 and 484. 
This indicates that, generally, the amino acid positions at which antibody escape mutations have been detected in vitro tolerate mutations at least to some degree in vivo.
Within the RBD, the positions at which amino acid 
substitutions are present at the highest frequency are located close to the RBD–ACE2 interface 
(fIg.  3). Of the 
three RBD amino acid substitutions present in several 
thousand sequences, N439K and N501Y were described 
earlier, and N501Y is discussed in more detail in the next section in the context of variants of concern. The other substitution, S477N, is estimated to have emerged at 
least seven times in the global SARS- CoV-2 population 
and has persisted at a frequency of between 4% and 7% 
of sequences globally since mid- June 2020 
(ref.53). One 
study described multiple mAbs that selected for the 
emergence of S477N and found this mutant to be resist-
ant to neutralization by the entire panel of RBD- targeting 
mAbs that were tested. By contrast, when tested with convalescent serum, neutralization of the S477N mutant 
was similar to that of the wild type
48. In common with 
N439K and N501Y , S477N results in increased affinity for the ACE2 receptor, although to a lesser extent
19,54. As 
described in Box  2, substitutions may facilitate immune 
escape by increasing receptor-  binding affinity inde -
pendently of any effect that they may have on antibody

0123456789();: recognition of epitopes; therefore, it is possible that such 
a mechanism contributes to the impact of S477N on 
neutralization. Variant frequency is also moderately high 
at RBD–ACE2 interface amino acid positions 417, 453  
and 446. Of these positions, 446 occurs in a location in the spike structure that is predicted to be highly anti-
genic, and substitutions at this site are described as 
affecting neutralization by both mAbs and antibodies present in polyclonal serum
39,43,46,48. Substitutions at 
amino acid positions 417 and 453 are described in the 
next section in the context of variants of concern.
Variants of interest or concern
In addition to single mutations of note, more heavily 
mutated SARS- CoV-2 lineages have emerged. Arguably 
the first variant of interest defined by the presence of sev-eral spike mutations, and referred to as B.1.1.298 (cluster 5),  was detected in Denmark spreading among farmed mink and a small number of people
20. This lineage is character -
ized by four amino acid differences, ΔH69–V70, Y453F, 
I692V and M1229I (fIg.  5). Of these, the Y453F substitu-
tion occurs at a residue within the ACE2 footprint and has been shown by DMS to increase ACE2 affinity
19. In 
addition, Y453F has been described as reducing neu-tralization by mAbs
47. In late 2020 and early 2021, the 
emergence and sustained transmission of lineages with mutations that affect the characteristics of the virus 
received much attention, most notably lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P .1 (also known as 501Y .V1, 501Y .V2 and 501Y .V3, respectively). The locations of the spike muta-
tions in the B.1.1.298, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P .1 lineages 
are annotated in 
fIg. 5a, and information on the struc-
tural context and consequences of mutations for antibody 
recognition and ACE2 binding are shown in fIg. 5b.

In addition to substitutions, several deletions have been observed, particularly within the amino-  terminal domain (NTD). The most frequently 
detected NTD deletion is the two- residue deletion at positions 69 and 70 
(Δ69–70), present in 45,898 sequences. The S1–S2 boundary is at amino

0123456789();: Residue 501 is at the RBD–ACE2 interface (fIg.  2c), and 
N501Y has been shown experimentally to result in one 
of the highest increases in ACE2 affinity conferred by a 
single RBD mutation19. E484 has been identified as an 
immunodominant spike protein residue, with various 
substitutions, including E484K, facilitating escape from 
several mAbs40,47,48 as well as antibodies in convales-
cent plasma39–41,48. E484K is estimated to have emerged 
repeatedly in the global SARS- CoV-2 population53 
and has been described in two other lineages origi-
nating from lineage B.1.1.28 in addition to lineage P .1 
reported to be spreading in the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil (lineage P .2)
56 and in the Philippines (line-
age P .3)57. Whereas K417 is described in the epitopes 
of RBD class 1 and class 2 antibodies31, alterations to 
K417 tend to affect class 1 antibody binding and are 
therefore somewhat less important for the polyclonal 
antibody response to the RBD, which is dominated by class 2 antibody responses, which are more susceptible to substitutions such as E484K
44,58,59. In addition to their antigenic effect, both K417N and K417T are expected 
to moderately decrease ACE2- binding affinity19 (fIg.  5b). 
The ΔH69–V70 deletion has been identified in variants associated with immune escape in immunocompro-
mised individuals treated with convalescent plasma
24. 
Experiments have shown ",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the impact of spike protein mutations on the antigenicity and immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2 variants.,"Research Hypothesis:
The spike protein mutations, such as N439K, Y453F, E484K, and N501Y, may impact the antigenicity and immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2 variants, potentially leading to reduced neutralization by antibodies generated from natural infection or vaccination.

Research Proposal:
To investigate the impact of spike protein mutations on the antigenicity and immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2 variants, we propose to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the structural and functional consequences of these mutations. This will involve in vitro experiments to assess the binding affinity of the spike protein to ACE2 receptor and the neutralization potential of antibodies against the mutated spike protein. Additionally, structural studies, epitope mapping, and deep mutational scanning experiments will be employed to elucidate the antigenic consequences of these mutations. Furthermore, genomic analyses will be conducted to track the frequency and distribution of these mutations in the global SARS-CoV-2 population, providing insights into their evolutionary dynamics and potential impact on virus biology."

To test the origin of APe in the thymus of chimaeras, thymus cell 
suspensions were fractionated on a discontinuous Percoll gradiene9. 
Most cells with APe function were found in the specific gravity 1.05-1.06 
and 1.06-1.07 interfaces. Cells pooled from these fractions (2-4% of 
total thymocytes) were irradiated 0,500 rad) and placed in culture 
(5 x 105 cells per well) with a T-cell clone, c.l.e, specific for KLH seen 
in the context of I_Ek molecules; the C.l.e. clone, added to the cultures 
at 105 cells per well, was derived from an FI -+ B6 chimaera primed with 
KLH. Soluble KLH was added to cultures where indicated. Cultures 
were pulsed with I j.l.Ci 3H-TdR on day 2 and collected on day 3. Data 
are mean (±s.d.) of triplicate cultures. B6 -+ F, thymus APC, while unable 
to present KLH to clone C.l.e., are able to stimulate CBA lymph node 
T cells in mixed-lymphocyte cultures, though weakly (data not shown). 
Jenkinson et al.8, electron microscopy showed that dGuo-treated 
thymuses contained almost no lymphocytes or macrophages and 
consisted almost entirely of epithelial cells (Fig. 1) (confirmed 
in all of three experiments with two B6 and one CBA dGuo­
treated thymuses). Despite the extreme paucity of M0/DC in 
these thymuses, T cells differentiating in dGuo-treated thymus 
grafts exhibited strong restriction to thymic H-2 determinants 
(Table 1, groups e, h). 
Although we cannot at present explain the contradictory data 
of Longo et al.4•5, the above results seem to constitute a strong 
case that epithelial cells rather than M0/DC are responsible 
for imprinting the H-2-restricted specificity of Th cells; using 
a very similar approach to that of Longo and Schwartz4, Zinker­
nagel23 and Fink and Bevan24 found no evidence that M0/DC 
induce H-2 restriction of Tc cells. In the case of tolerance 
induction, however, there is accumulating evidence from both 
in vivo6,7 and in vitro25-27 studies that only M0/DC and not 
epithelial cells induce tolerance across H-2 barriers. The only 
evidence against this notion is that tolerance to thymic H-2 
determinants has been observed with T cells differentiating in 
thymuses precultured at low temperature28, another procedure 
that selectively destroys bone marrow-derived cells. It remains 
possible, however, that culture at low temperature is less effective 
than dGuo treatment in removing M0/DC. Note that, in agree­
ment with the findings of others6, we have confirmed that 
allografts of dGuo-treated fetal thymuses are accepted for pro­
longed periods and do not induce tolerance as measured by 
mixed-lymphocyte reactions (unpublished data), implying that 
our dGuo-treated thymus grafts were indeed depleted of 
M0/DC. 
According to the view that different cell types in the thymus 
control the induction of tolerance as opposed to H-2 restriction, 
T-cell specificity might be shaped as follows. Receptor-bearing 
thymocytes make initial contact with H-2 determinants on epi­
thelial cells in the cortex, a region largely free of M0/DC. After 
'learning' self-H-2-restricted specificity, the T cells then migrate 
from the cortex to the corti co-medullary junction. Here, contact 
with M0/DC deletes those T cells expressing high affinity for 
self-H-2 determinants. Low-affinity T cells then pass through

Selective rejection of H-2-deficient 
lymphoma variants suggests 
alternative immune defence strategy

Metazoan organisms may discriminate between self and non-self 
not only by the presence of foreign antigens but also by the absence 
of normal self markers!. Mammalian adaptive immune responses 
use the first strategy, with the additional requirement that foreign 
antigens are recognized in the context of self-major histocompati­
bility complex (MHC) products at the cell surfacel• Aberrant cells 
which fail to express MHC products adequately can therefore 
avoid detection2-4. A more primitive but complementary defence 
system, eliminating such cells on the basis of absent self-markers, 
is suggested by a re-interpretation5,6 of phenomena associated with 
metastasis and natural resistance. We now show that murine lym­
phoma cells selected for loss of H-2 expression are less malignant 
after low-dose inoculation in syngeneic hosts than are wild-type 
cells, and that the rejection of such cells is non-adaptive. On the 
basis of our data, we suggest that natural killer cells are effector 
cells in a defence system geared to detect the deleted or reduced 
expression of self-MHC. 
More specifically, the hypothesiss,6 stated that self-MHC 
genes influence the expression or recognition of inhibitor signals 
in interactions between potential target cells and natural effector 
cells. Our experimental approach was to test the prediction that 
selection for loss of H-2 in tumour lines should be accompanied 
by an increased sensitivity to natural resistance in vitro and in 
vivo. Three independent anti-H-2-resistant sub lines from two 
lymphomas were selected. Such variant cells not only were able 
to escape adaptive alloreactivity in vitro and in vivo, but, as 
predicted by our hypothesis, had also become unable to grow ©          Nature Publishing Group1986~~~6------------------------------------LETTERSTONATURE--------------~N~A~TU~R~E~VO~L~.~3~19~2~O~F=EB~R~U~A~R~Y~1~98~6

out from small inocula in the normal syngeneic host, and swit­
ched from the natural killer (NK)-resistant to the NK-sensitive 
phenotype as a consequence of the selection against H-2 
expression. 
We used the RBL-5 lymphoma (H_2b) for these studies 
because it readily expresses H-2 and is highly malignant in the 
normal syngeneic host. In contrast to two other C57BL-derived 
lymphomas, the number of tumour takes after a threshold 
inoculum was not significantly increased in NK-cell-defective 
mice7• This lymphoma is therefore probably regarded as close 
to 'normal self' by natural resistance mechanisms in the 
syngeneic or H-2b/b-compatible hosts. In contrast, the subline 
that had been selected for loss of H-2 expression (RMA H-2 
sel) failed to grow in such mice, even after a lO-fold increase 
in the dose required for 100% takes of the wild-type tumour 
(Table 1). The sub line had been derived after mutagenization 
and repeated treatment with alloantiserum and complement. It 
was completely resistant to this treatment, due to a selective 
loss or reduction in expression of MHC class I gene products 
(Table 1) and ~2""microglobulin; it did not stain significantly 
above normal control serum with alloantibodies on analysis by 
fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) (Fig. I), while binding 
and complement-dependent killing with anti-Thy 1.2 antibodies 
were unaffected (Table 1). The wild-type and the selected line 
were both negative for monoclonal antibodies against TL and 
I_Ab antigens (not shown). 
In view of the proposed hypothesis, it was important first to 
study natural resistance in syngeneic (C57BL) or at least semi­
syngeneic (A.BY x C57BL) H_2b/ b homozygous hosts, in order 
to avoid combinations producing strong T-cell reactivity. In an 
attempt to obtain the latter situation in subsequent studies, a

and the 4-6-h 5lCr-release assays were set up as described pre­
viously39 and all three lines were tested in parallel in each of the 
experiments. 
high-dose inocula were given to inbred A.BY mice (rather than 
outcrossed to C56BL), presenting a minor histocompatibility 
barrier to the RBL-5 lymphoma8• The pattern of progressive 
tumour growth then changed to the opposite: H-2-variant lym­
phoma cells grew progressively once they had formed a tumour, 
whereas all wild-type tumours were rejected after temporary 
growth (Fig. I). High-dose challenge (I x 106 cells) ofpreimmun­
ized syngeneic C57BL mice gave a similar picture: complete 
protection was seen with the wild-type line, while H-2-resistant 
cells failed to immunize against themselves (Table 1). These 
results and observations on tumour outgrowth in pre-irradiated 
hosts (Table 1) indicated that the reduced tumorigenicity of 
H-2-lacking variant cells was not due to an intrinsic inability 
to grow in vivo, but rather to an active host defence, dependent 
on radiosensitive (precursor) cells, but independent of tumour 
immunogenicity in the classical sense. It was important to estab­
lish that this was the case, in view of reports that low malignant 
mutant or transfectant tumour lines can acquire the ability to 
elicit strong adaptive T-cell responses9-12• Indeed, the variants 
seemed to escape T-cell recognition in vivo, probably because 
minor histocompatibility antigens and tumour anti~ens are rec­
ognized only in the context of self-MHC products ,13 and thus 
fulfilled one of the criteria for action by the postulated defence 
system. The variant cells were also able to escape anti-H-2b ©          Nature Publishing Group1986~N~ATU~R~E~V~O~L~.~3~19~2~O~F~E~BR~U~A~R~Y~19~86~ ____________ ---LETTERSTONATURE-------------------- ----------------~6~77

Sublloes: RBL-5 is a Rauscher virus-induced lymphoma and EL-4 a benzpyrene-induced leukaemia , both originating in the C57BL strain. The cells, maintained in 
RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin, were mutagenized with ethanemethanesulphonate (EMS, Sigma), 200 ~g ml-' for 24 h. After washes, the 
cells were allowed to recover for 1 week and then treated with alloantiserum (A/Sn -> A.BY diluted 1: 20, 107 cells ml-') followed by rabbit complement (Pel Freez, 
1/10) for 1-4 h. The cells were cultured without any attempts to remove the dead cells, and the survivors «0.25%) were expanded . The treatment was repeated at least 
four times. Serology: The A/Sn -> A.BY (anti-H-2b) serum was produced in our animal colony at the Karolinska Institute. The monoclonal antibody (mab) 20-8-4S (ref. 
38) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection _ The anti-~2-microglobulin (~2M) reagents were kindly sent by Drs Shen and Boyse (Sloan Kettering 
Memorial Institute, New York) (mab) and Dr Tanigaki (Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo) (rabbit antiserum ). The F705 reagent was a gift from Dr E. Clark

400R-pre-irradiated mice to avoid immunoselect ion in vivo. Different numbers of tumour cells were injected subcutaneously to groups of three to six H-2-syngeneic 
hosts, either C57BL or (A.BYx C57BLlF, for all tumours in each experiment. The two types of mice gave consistent results, and the number of mice with tumour takes 
(out of totally injected) have therefore been pooled from several different experiments , each one including wild-type and variant cells injected to parallel groups. Two 
experiment s with 10' cells included parallel groups of pre irradiated mice (400R, 24 h before tumour challenge). The data with 106 injected cells represent two experiments 
where half of the mice had been preimmunized with the challenging tumour (three weekly injections of 2 x 107 10,000 R irradiated RMA or RMA H-2 sel. cells). NT,

cytotoxic lymphocytes in vitro (Fig. 2) as a result of the selection. 
However . at the same time, they had switched from the NK­
resistant to the NK-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 2). 
Although the in vivo results presented here do not prove 
definitively that the natural resistance was mediated by NK 
cells, the non-adaptive nature of the rejection and the results 
on irradiated hosts are consistent with this interpretation . The 
dose of 400R reduces splenic cellularity by 95%; even if some 
functional NK cells remain, the total activity in terms of lytic 
units per animal is reduced within 24 h, and falls to zero within 
the following weeks, that is, the period between tumour injection 
and outgrowth in our experimentsl4• This enhanced sensitivity 
to natural resistance in vitro and in vivo was observed with an

with an EL-4 subline selected in a similar fashion (Table 1, Fig. 
3). The generallysability of the wild-type control line was also 
confirmed in the case of EL-4, which was efficiently killed 
(>50% lysis at effector target/ratio 5:1) by anti-H-2-specific, 
mixed lymphocyte culture-derived effector cells (data not 
shown). 
According to the proposed model, the tumour cells would be 
unable to inhibit triggering of NK lysis after complete or partial 
loss of self H_25•6• This would be consistent with several observa­
tions on NK cells, including high sensitivity of in vitro-grown 
YAC-l lymphoma cells, immature thymocytes and teratocar­
cinoma cells, all of which have low or defective MHC 
expression 15,16. The corresponding cells show reduced sensitivity 
when H-2 is induced (by differentiationl7,3o, interferon19 or ©          Nature Publishing Group1986m ~~8 __________________________________ ~LETTERSTONATURE ______________ ~N~A~TU~R~E~VO~L ~.~3~19~2~0~F~EB~R~U~A~R~Y~1~986 
growth in vivo2). NK-cell-mediated rejection of H-2-disparate 
bone marrow and lymphoid grafts, including the F, hybrid 
resistance phenomenon'8,2l,22 and early elimination of 
allogeneic lymphocytes23, are other examples that could be 
reinterpreted to reflect recognition of incomplete self-H-2 
expression: allogeneic grafts lack H-2 genes of the recipient, 
and parental grafts fail to match one haplotype, that is, they 
lack 50% or more of the total 'self'-H-2 molecules expressed 
in the FI recipient environment. This predicts that the relation­
ship between reduced self expression and NK susceptibility 
should be quantitative rather than dependent on complete dele­
tion of H-2 products, as is indeed supported by findings with 
a subline of RBL-5 derived after the two first selections with 
anti-H-2 + complement. These cells had an average loss on H-2 
fluorescence corresponding to more than 50% of the total H-2 
expression in the original line, and a clear increase in NK 
sensitivity (Fig. 2). 
The hypothesis would also explain why it is difficult to select 
H-2-variants in vivo24, and predict a selection for increased 
H-2 expression during tumour progression. The correlation 
between metastatic potential and increased expression of a1l25 
or certain (D-end encoded26,27) MHC class I alleles observed 
for several experimental tumours could therefore be reinter­
preted as selection of phenotypes able to escape NK cells. 
However, preferential outgrowth of cells with reduced or deleted 
expression of certain MHC alleles (often H-2K-end encoded) 
has been observed after large-dose inoculation (;;.105 cells) of 
some virally induced, strongly antigenic tumours 12,28,29. T cells 
presumably represented the major surveillance mechanism in 
those systems, as they would in the present experiments, where 
H-2-deficient sublines grew out preferentially after transplanta­
tion of large-dose inocula to preimmunized C57BL or histo­
incompatible ABY mice (Table 1, Fig. 1). 
Burnet pointed out the fundamental difference between 
strategies for self-non-self-discrimination in invertebrates and 
mammals '. In the colonial tunicate Botryllus, rejection of 
allogeneic cells as well as control against self-fertilization is 
thought to operate by a mechanism scanning for the presence 
or absence of self-markers, encoded by a single locus with 
considerable polymorphism,
,31. Such a system may also have 
been fixed in mammals, despite the development of adaptive 
immunity. The selective pressures would have required not only 
a back-up system eliminating aberrant (MHC loss) cells escaping 
detection by T lymphocytes, but also a rapid first-line defence 
with a certain selectivity. Examples exist of lytic as well as 
transforming viruses that cause a profound but selective reduc­
tion of H-2 expression in infected cells29,32. The latter would 
be eliminated by the proposed defence mechanism, while spar­
ing of normal cells in the tissues would be guaranteed by an 
increase in their H-2 expression due to interferon stimulation 
early in immune responses and NK-cell activation. Interferons 
do reduce the NK susceptibility of many targets33; the mechan­
isms involved are unknown, but may be related to MHC gene 
regulation as suggested by observations on variant cells in this 
(Fig. 3f) and another studl'. 
The present findings may also be relevant to previous specula­
tions by Sne1l34 and Daussees concerning the primordial func­
tions of MHC genes, that is, functions that would not be related 
to T-cell restriction. The possibility of a common regulation of 
H-2 expression, NK-cell-resistant phenotype and malignancy 
properties in lymphoma cells is also very interesting in relation 
to recent advances in the research on regulation of MHC class 
I genes, particularly in tumour cells36,37,

Myotonic muscular dystrophy, or Steinert disease, is a dominantly 
inherited disease of muscle which occurs with a frequency of 
between 1 in 18,000 and 1 in 7,500 people (refs 1,2). One of the 
prominent clinical manifestations is muscle stiffness and difficulty 
in relaxation of mucles after voluntary contractions. Electrophys­
iological signs of myotonia include increased excitability with a 
tendency to fire trains of repetitive action potentials in response 
to direct electrical and mechanical stimulation. Most experimental 
and clinical data suggest that myotonic muscular dystrophy arises 
from genetically induced alterations of the muscle membraDe3• 
We show here for the first time that muscle membranes of patients 
with myotonic muscular dystrophy contain the receptor for apamin, 
a bee venom toxin known to be a specific and high-affinity blocker 
of one class of Ca2+ -activated K+ channels in mammalian 
muscle4-<i. The apamin receptor is completely absent in normal 
human muscle as well as in muscles of patients with spinal anterior 
hom disorders. ",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the role of the apamin receptor in the pathophysiology of myotonic muscular dystrophy.,"Research Hypothesis:
The presence of the apamin receptor in the muscle membranes of patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy suggests a potential role for this receptor in the pathophysiology of the disease. It is hypothesized that dysregulation or dysfunction of the apamin receptor may contribute to the muscle stiffness and myotonia characteristic of myotonic muscular dystrophy.

Research Proposal:
To investigate the role of the apamin receptor in the pathophysiology of myotonic muscular dystrophy, the following research proposal is suggested:
1. Characterize the expression and activity of the apamin receptor in muscle samples from a larger cohort of patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy, as well as in age-matched healthy controls and individuals with other neuromuscular disorders.
2. Investigate the functional consequences of modulating the apamin receptor activity in muscle cells, using in vitro and ex vivo experimental models.
3. Explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting the apamin receptor to alleviate the muscle stiffness and myotonia associated with myotonic muscular dystrophy.
4. Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of the apamin receptor in myotonic muscular dystrophy, including genetic and epigenetic factors that may influence its expression and function."

Alignments ofclass1and2receptors separately reveal14

receptor secondary structure ischaracterized byanam-
phiphilic patternofalternating hydrophobic/-philic residues.
Analogous patterns ofsequence/structure conservation
andvariability inclass1and2receptors suggested anatural
superposition ofalternating blocksandgaps.Thisresultedin
agreatercorrespondence ofsimilarresidues withinthe14

tinesoftheclass1and2receptor alignment detected an
internalduplication ofan-100-amino aciddomaincontaining

servedmotifsinclude(i)apairofprolineresidues that
precede anamphiphilic 83-strand inblock1,(ii)aconserved

extent,block5)isaprominent segment ofrelatively non-
conserved chain,bothbetween sequences withinareceptor
classandbetween domains ofbothclasses.
Thesuperposition ofclass1and2modules suggests that
theclass-distinctive cysteine residues aredispensable forthe
coredomainfold.However, thepatternofdisulfidebonding
between thescattered cysteines ineitherclass1or2domains
provides strongspatialconstraints fortertiaryfolding.Chem-

Thesequence similarity ofrepeated domainsinclass1and

Structural Analysis ofSharedReceptor andFBNDomains.
Sequence patternsdiagnostic oftheconserved blocksofthe-100-residue receptor modules detectasignificant similarity
toFBNtypeIIIdomains incomputer searches ofprotein
databanks (15,32).tInparticular, theconserved block2
tryptophan andblock6tyrosine findspatialequivalents in
typicalFBN-like domains. Thesemodular unitshavebeen
identified inawidevarietyofadhesive proteins (13)by
homology tosequence motifsdistilledfromthe16typeIII
subunits ofFBN(12).Asequence/structure analysis analo-
goustotheoneperformed onreceptor NandCdomains was
carriedoutwithrepresentative typeIIIrepeatsfromFBN
(28),HEX(29),andLAR(33).Regionsofchainequivalent to

FBNdomains areexactlyencodedbypairsofexonsbounded

",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the evolutionary emergence of cytokine receptors from primitive adhesive modules.,"Research hypothesis: The evolutionary emergence of cytokine receptors from primitive adhesive modules can be investigated by examining the structural and sequence similarities between cytokine receptors and fibronectin type III domains. It is hypothesized that the shared receptor and fibronectin domains reveal evolutionary links to fibronectin-like structures, suggesting a common origin and potential evolutionary pathway.

Research proposal: The proposed research aims to investigate the evolutionary emergence of cytokine receptors from primitive adhesive modules by conducting comparative structural and sequence analyses of cytokine receptors and fibronectin type III domains. This research will involve predictive structural analysis, mapping of amphipathic segments, and identification of conserved regions to elucidate the evolutionary relationships and potential ancestral origins of cytokine receptors. Additionally, the research will explore the potential functional implications of the structural similarities between cytokine receptors and fibronectin-like structures in understanding the evolutionary emergence of regulatory molecules from primitive adhesive modules."

We report that during activation of the simian virus 40
(SV40) pre-replication complex, SV40 T antigen (Tag)helicase actively loads replication protein A (RPA) on
emerging single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This novel load-
ing process requires physical interaction of Tag originDNA-binding domain (OBD) with the RPA high-afﬁnityssDNA-binding domains (RPA70AB). Heteronuclear NMRchemical shift mapping revealed that Tag-OBD binds to
RPA70AB at a site distal from the ssDNA-binding sites and
that RPA70AB, Tag-OBD, and an 8-nucleotide ssDNA forma stable ternary complex. Intact RPA and Tag also interactstably in the presence of an 8-mer, but Tag dissociates fromthe complex when RPA binds to longer oligonucleotides.Together, our results imply that an allosteric change in
RPA quaternary structure completes the loading reaction.
A mechanistic model is proposed in which the ternarycomplex is a key intermediate that directly couples originDNA unwinding to RPA loading on emerging ssDNA.The EMBO Journal (2006) 25,5516–5526. doi:10.1038/

Introduction
Replication protein A (RPA) is a conserved eukaryotic single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein that was discovered
as an essential factor in the cell-free replication of simianvirus 40 (SV40) DNA (Wold, 1997; Iftode et al , 1999;
Bochkarev and Bochkareva, 2004). A large body of evidencenow demonstrates that RPA is an obligatory participant in
most eukaryotic DNA processing pathways, from DNA repli-
cation, repair, and recombination through somatic hyper-
mutation in lymphocytes and DNA damage signaling (Zouand Elledge, 2003; Chaudhuri et al , 2004; Stauffer and
Chazin, 2004).
RPA is a highly ﬂexible modular protein composed of three
subunits (RPA70, RPA32, RPA14) that are stably associated
with each other (Figure 1). Three-dimensional structures ofeach of the seven individual domains and several subassem-blies are now available, but the quaternary structure(s) ofRPA remains unknown (Bochkarev and Bochkareva, 2004;
Stauffer and Chazin, 2004). Four of the domains (DNA-
binding domains (DBDs) A–D) bind to ssDNA with decreas-ing afﬁnity from A to D (Figure 1). RPA binding to ssDNAoccurs sequentially and with a deﬁned polarity, beginningwith DBD-A and -B at the 5
0end, yielding three different
states that occlude 8–10, 12–23, or 28–30 nucleotides (de Laat
et al, 1998; Iftode and Borowiec, 2000; Bastin-Shanower and
Brill, 2001; Arunkumar et al, 2003; Wyka et al, 2003). The
three states of RPA are thought to coexist in solution, indynamic equilibrium with each other (Blackwell et al, 1996).
Studies of free RPA70AB (residues 181–422) reveal that the
linker peptide between domains A and B is ﬂexible
(Arunkumar et al, 2003), whereas RPA70AB bound to an
8-nucleotide ssDNA adopts a structure with domains A, B,and the linker in a ﬁxed orientation (Bochkarev et al, 1997;
Bochkareva et al, 2001; Arunkumar et al, 2003).
RPA also interacts directly with and modulates the activity
of a large and growing number of factors that are required for
proper processing of ssDNA (Iftode et al, 1999; Fanning et al,
2006). The binding sites for these proteins have been mappedto regions in the RPA70N, 70A, 70B, and 32C domains(Figure 1). Notably, many of the DNA processing factors
are, like RPA, modular multi-domain proteins, and in most
instances, their interactions with RPA involve multiple con-tact points between two or more domains.
The viral replicative DNA helicase, SV40 T antigen (Tag),
binds to RPA via its origin DNA-binding domain (OBD,
residues 131–259) and this interaction is essential for SV40
DNA replication (Dornreiter et al , 1992; Melendy and
Stillman, 1993; Weisshart et al , 1998). The Tag-binding
regions of RPA have been mapped to RPA70 residues 169–327 (Braun et al, 1997) or RPA70A (Loo and Melendy, 2004;
Park et al, 2005), and RPA32C (Lee and Kim, 1995). Although
the physical interaction of Tag-OBD with RPA70 remains
poorly understood, an important step forward was madepossible by construction of a model of Tag-OBD andRPA32C from extensive NMR data (Arunkumar et al, 2005).
An understanding of how RPA functions in the progression
of ssDNA processing pathways remains elusive. One proposal
is that processing proteins successively compete with eachother for RPA, allowing them to switch places on DNA as the

1999). This mechanism, termed hand-off, correlates withthe increasing afﬁnity of proteins for RPA during lagging
strand SV40 DNA replication in vitro (Yuzhakov et al ,
1999). There is also evidence for a mechanism involvingprotein-mediated remodeling of RPA, from an extended con-formation into a compact conformation that more readilydissociates from ssDNA, which allows incoming proteins to
access ssDNA. For example, we recently demonstrated that
Tag binding to RPA32C facilitates replacement of RPA onssDNA by DNA polymerase alpha-primase to promote primersynthesis, and proposed that this transition is based on theability of Tag to bind and remodel the ssDNA-binding mode of
RPA (Arunkumar et al, 2005).
The ability of RPA-binding proteins to facilitate its displa-
cement from ssDNA led us to consider whether RPA freelydiffuses onto ssDNA or whether DNA processing proteinsactively load RPA on ssDNA. Here, we demonstrate that theTag double hexamer, which serves as a simple pre-replication
complex on the viral origin, selectively loads human RPA
on the emerging ssDNA at the origin. To deﬁne the structuralbasis for this loading reaction, we map the physical interac-tion surfaces of Tag and RPA70AB in detail and show that Tagforms a ternary complex with RPA70 domains A and B bound
to a minimal ssDNA-binding site of 8 nucleotides. However,
in the presence of a 30-nucleotide oligomer, Tag was found todissociate from the ternary complex. Our evidence suggeststhat the ternary complex initially couples activation of SV40origin unwinding by Tag helicase with RPA loading ontossDNA, and then dissociates to enable RPA binding in an
extended mode to the full ssDNA site.
Results
Selective loading of human RPA during unwinding of
the SV40 replication originTo determine whether origin DNA unwinding by Tag doublehexamer is coupled to RPA recruitment and concomitantloading onto ssDNA, we asked whether Tag would selectively
load human RPA onto emerging ssDNA in the presence of a
competing ssDNA-binding protein that supports origin un-winding but not later steps in SV40 replication. Yeast RPA waschosen as the competitor in this experiment because it bindsssDNA with an afﬁnity similar to human RPA (Figure 2A
and B) and supports Tag-catalyzed unwinding of SV40 originDNA, but it does not bind to Tag and does not support primer
synthesis in SV40 replication (Brill and Stillman, 1989;Melendy and Stillman, 1993; Iftode and Borowiec, 1997;
Sibenaller et al, 1998; Arunkumar et al, 2005). We reasoned
that if yeast RPA can compete with human RPA for theemerging ssDNA, it should inhibit replication of the templateDNA in a concentration-dependent manner.
To test this prediction, initiation of SV40 replication was
monitored in a reaction containing supercoiled origin DNA,
and puriﬁed proteins Tag, DNA polymerase alpha-primase,
topoisomerase I, a limiting amount of human RPA, ribo- anddeoxyribonucleotides, and radiolabeled dTTP. In this reac-tion, a low level of initiation (Figure 2D, lane 1) was detected,although clearly above that in negative control reactions
(lanes 9 and 10). Additional human RPA stimulated robust
initiation (lanes 2–4), conﬁrming that the lowest level ofhuman RPA was sub-saturating. As expected, no replicationproducts were detected in a reaction that contained yeast RPAin place of human RPA (lane 11). Moreover, addition of yeastRPA in up to a ﬁve-fold excess over the human RPA failed
to reduce the initiation activity of human RPA (lanes 5–8). In
fact, we note a weak stimulation that, based on the absenceof activity in lane 11, appears to be nonspeciﬁc. Together,these results suggest that Tag selectively loaded human RPAonto ssDNA during origin unwinding, which prevents yeast
RPA from gaining access to the template.
To conﬁrm this interpretation, SV40 initiation was tested
using limiting human RPA in the presence of increasingamounts of a chimeric RPA hRPAy32C, in which the yeastRPA32C domain replaced the human RPA32C domain. This
chimeric RPA binds to ssDNA (Figure 2A and C) and to Tag,
but does not support Tag-mediated primer synthesis(Arunkumar et al, 2005). As in Figure 2D, the low initiation
activity with limiting human RPA (Figure 2E, lane 1) wasstimulated by additional human RPA (lanes 2–4). However, incontrast to the results with excess yeast RPA (Figure 2D),
increasing amounts of chimeric RPA inhibited initiation in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 2E, lanes 5–8), almost downto the level detected in a control reaction with chimeric RPAalone (lane 11). These results implicate physical interactionsof Tag with the RPA70 subunit in selectively loading RPA onto
ssDNA during unwinding. Taken together, the results in
Figure 2 strongly suggest that origin unwinding is coupledwith RPA loading directly onto the emerging ssDNA.
Domain mapping of interactions between Tag and RPA
The results in Figure 2 suggest that physical interactionbetween Tag and RPA could play an important role incoupling origin unwinding with RPA loading. Detailed map-ping of the interactions between Tag and RPA70 was per-
formed to conﬁrm which domains of Tag and RPA70 are
involved. Our ﬁrst approach involved pull-down assays inwhich a constant amount of full-length Tag or GST-fused Tag-OBD was titrated with puriﬁed intact RPA or RPA70AB underbuffer conditions similar to those used for cell-free SV40 DNAreplication (Supplementary Figure 1). RPA binding to puriﬁed
Tag was easily detectable with small amounts of RPA
(Supplementary Figure 1B). When the same amount of Tagbeads was incubated with RPA70AB, which lacks the knownRPA32C interaction region, about eight-fold higher molaramounts were required to detect a level of binding compar-
able to that obtained with RPA heterotrimer (Supplementary

bound full-length RPA quite well, and about eight-fold greatermolar amounts of RPA70AB were required to detect compar-able binding (Supplementary Figure 1D and E). These dataconﬁrm that RPA binds to Tag-OBD through RPA70AB, inaddition to RPA32C, and that both interactions contribute to
the overall binding afﬁnity.
A second approach to characterize RPA70AB interactions
with Tag-OBD involved proteolysis protection assays. InRPA70AB, the ﬂexible linker between the two high-afﬁnityssDNA-binding domains A and B is sensitive to proteolysis
(Gomes and Wold, 1996; Gomes et al , 1996). RPA70AB
binding to ssDNA ﬁxes the relative positions of the twodomains and protects the linker against digestion (Gomes
et al, 1996; Bochkarev et al, 1997). To gain insight into the
interaction of RPA70AB with Tag-OBD, limited proteolysis ofRPA70AB was carried out in the presence and absence ofOBD. Without OBD, the linker between RPA70A and -B wasalmost completely cleaved after digestion for 2 h (Figure 3A).
In contrast, intact RPA70AB remained detectable for at least
15 h in the presence of OBD (Figure 3B). The stabilization ofthe linker strongly resembled that observed for RPA70ABdigested in the presence of ssDNA (dC
8) (Figure 3C). These
observations indicate that like ssDNA, OBD binds and stabi-
lizes RPA70AB, but do not reveal whether the OBD binds
to the same surface of RPA as ssDNA or a different one.

pletely resistant to trypsin proteolysis in the presence of bothssDNA and OBD. The fact that ssDNA and OBD together
stabilized RPA70AB more effectively than did either alone
implies that a stable ternary complex is formed with discretebinding sites for each component.
RP70AB binds ssDNA and Tag-OBD at distinct sites
In order to determine the structural basis for the proposedcoupling of origin unwinding to active RPA loading ontoemerging ssDNA, heteronuclear NMR was used to directlymap the Tag-OBD interacting surface of RPA70AB. The strat-
egy involved monitoring perturbations of NMR signals as
Tag-OBD is titrated into a solution of RPA70AB. This ap-proach has proven extremely valuable for mapping bindingsurfaces because the NMR chemical shift for each nucleus isextremely sensitive to its electronic environment. Whileperturbations will arise from direct binding as well as allos-
teric structural changes, binding sites can often be distin-
guished because a series of spatially proximate residues thatform a contiguous surface is discernable from the ensembleof chemical shift data.
The experiments were performed by monitoring
15N-1H
HSQC spectra of15N-enriched RPA70AB as unlabeled Tag-
OBD was titrated because this allowed RPA70AB signals to becleanly discriminated from those of Tag-OBD. A single set ofsignals was observed at all points during the titration, whichindicates that RPA70AB is in fast exchange between its free
and bound states, consistent with relatively weak binding
in the micromolar range. Figure 4A shows the overlay of aportion of an HSQC spectrum of free RPA70AB and oneobtained in the presence of 2 molar excess of Tag-OBD.Although most of the peaks were not affected by the presenceof OBD, a subset of the peaks progressively moved or
broadened as the titration proceeded. Residues that displayed
readily discernible changes in NMR chemical shift are labeledin the inset of Figure 4A. Mapping of the residues perturbedupon titration with Tag-OBD on the structure of RPA70ABrevealed a contiguous surface along the linker and into both
domains (Figure 4B). To conﬁrm that this is a physicallyrealistic surface for Tag-OBD binding, the RPA70AB and Tag-
OBD structures were inspected to conﬁrm that Tag-OBD islarge enough to span across the linker and interact with both
the A and B domains. Overall, these results imply that Tag-
OBD binds to RPA70AB at a site that is remote from thessDNA-binding sites.
To obtain further insight into the coupling of the binding of
ssDNA and Tag-OBD to RPA70AB, additional NMR spectra
were recorded for
15N-enriched RPA70AB in the binary com-
plex with ssDNA and the ternary complex with OBD andssDNA (Figure 4C). Remarkably, the overall quality of thespectra was better for the larger ternary complex than foreither of the binary complexes, a reﬂection of an increasedstructural stability of the ternary complex. Comparison of
these spectra revealed three important points. First, the
changes induced in the NMR spectrum by binding ofssDNA were mostly distinct from those induced by bindingof Tag-OBD. For example, the changes in chemical shifts forD291 and Q299 are observed only when OBD is added to
the solution, regardless of whether or not ssDNA is present
(Figure 4C). Second, in addition to perturbations of RPA70ABchemical shifts, new peaks appear in the spectrum, whichcan be attributed to resonances from residues that are stabi-lized upon binding. Third, the spectrum of the ternary com-plex of RPA70AB, OBD, and ssDNA contains all of the ‘new’
peaks that appear in the spectra of the binary complexes, as
well a very small number of additional peaks. Thus, inaddition to revealing that Tag-OBD binds to a surface ofRPA70AB that is remote from the ssDNA-binding site, theseobservations provide evidence for the energetic coupling of
the binding of two different ligands (ssDNA and Tag-OBD) to
RPA70AB, which suggests the possibility of function throughan allosteric structural mechanism (vide infra).
Tag-OBD associates with RPA70AB through
electrostatic interactionsIn order to deepen our understanding of the structural basisfor the interaction between RPA70AB and Tag-OBD, the NMR-based strategy was used to map the region of Tag-OBD that
binds to RPA70AB. To this end,
15N-enriched Tag-OBD was

&2006 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 25 |NO 23 |2006 5519titrated with unlabeled RPA70AB and chemical shift perturba-
tions were monitored (Figure 5A). The most signiﬁcant effect
detected was the perturbation of residues from three regions
that together form a contiguous binding surface on Tag-OBD (F151-T155, F183-H187, H203-A207) (Figure 5B, circle).This surface has a signiﬁcant basic character arising pri-marily from three prominent surface residues: R154, R202,and R204.
These results, combined with the analysis of the RPA70AB-
binding site, indicate that there is a signiﬁcant electrostaticcomponent to the interaction of Tag-OBD with RPA70AB. Inparticular, the basic residues on the Tag-OBD-binding surfaceare complemented by the highly acidic nature of the
RPA70AB-binding surface, in which residues E290, D291,D292, D404, and D407 form a dense negatively charged
surface on the opposite side of RPA70AB from the ssDNA-
binding surface (Figure 5C). To verify the importance of theelectrostatic complementarity observed in the RPA70AB-Tag-OBD-binding interface, charge reversal mutations weredesigned in Tag-OBD at the RPA-binding interface with thegoal of weakening the interaction with RPA70AB. Indeed,
RPA70AB binding of puriﬁed full-length Tag containing the
R154E mutation was 8- to 10-fold weaker than of wild-typeTag (Figure 5D, lanes 3–6; Figure 5E), conﬁrming theimportance of the electrostatic character of the interactionsurface. As a control, the mutant Tag-OBD was subjected to
biophysical/structural analysis, which showed that the
reduction in binding afﬁnity did not arise from perturbationof the structure (Supplementary Figure 2).
Physical interaction with Tag-OBD stimulates ssDNA
binding of RPAThe ﬁnding that Tag-OBD and ssDNA bind to different sites inRPA70AB led us to ask whether full-length Tag can also form
a ternary complex with trimeric RPA and ssDNA. To examine
this possibility, RPA complexes were pre-formed with Tagadsorbed to antibody beads, and after unbound RPA wasremoved, ssDNA was titrated into the complexes. The lengthsof ssDNA chosen for this experiment (8, 15, or 30 nucleo-tides) correspond to those bound by RPA in its three different
binding modes (see Introduction). The complexes were in-
cubated with ssDNA for 1 h and then analyzed by SDS–PAGEand Western blotting to detect bound RPA (Figure 6A). In theabsence of ssDNA, RPA remained stably bound to the Tagbeads for at least 1 h after removal of the free RPA (lanes 3).
When the Tag–RPA complexes were exposed to an 8-nucleo-
tide ssDNA (upper panel) or, as a negative control, to duplexDNA (not shown), the complexes remained stable. In thepresence of a 15-mer, most of the RPA remained bound to theTag beads except when exposed to the highest amounts ofssDNA (middle panel, lanes 8 and 9). Remarkably, in the
presence of a 30-mer, most of the bound RPA was dissociated
from Tag (lower panel, lanes 4–9). These ﬁndings indicatethat the length of ssDNA bound to RPA affects its ability toexist in a stable complex with Tag. One possible interpreta-tion of the data is that RPA in its compact binding mode with
an 8-mer forms a stable ternary complex with Tag, but that
RPA in its extended binding mode with a 30-mer binds moreweakly to Tag, leading to its dissociation from Tag. Thiscorrelates with the greater afﬁnity of RPA for a 30-mer thanfor shorter oligonucleotides.
To gain further insight into the interaction of RPA with
ssDNA in the presence and absence of Tag, electrophoreticmobility shift assays were performed. In the absence of Tag,RPA bound to radiolabeled ssDNA (dT
30) with the expected
1:1 stoichiometry of RPA:ssDNA (RPA I) (Figure 6B, lanes 1,4, and 7). Importantly, when Tag was added to the same
amount of RPA that had been pre-incubated with labeled
dT
30, the stoichiometry remained 1:1 but the abundance of
the RPA:ssDNA complex clearly increased (lanes 2, 3, 5, and6). Hence, Tag stimulated RPA binding to the 30-nucleotidessDNA, even though there is no evidence of Tag being present
in the complex along with RPA and ssDNA.

at the highest concentration of RPA when Tag was present(RPAII; Figure 6B, lanes 8 and 9). To characterize the com-
position of this complex, the mobility shift experiment was
repeated in the presence of monoclonal antibody against RPAor Tag. When a saturating amount of RPA was incubated withradiolabeled ssDNA (Figure 6C, lanes 2 and 3), addition ofTag was seen to lead to the formation of a slowly migrating
ssDNA complex (RPAII) (lane 3). When puriﬁed monoclonal
antibody against the extreme C-terminus of Tag was titratedinto the binding reaction, the mobility of the ssDNA complexremained unchanged (lanes 4–6). Two other antibodies thatrecognize epitopes remote from the Tag-OBD and do notinterfere with RPA:Tag complex formation (Weisshart et al,
1998) yielded identical results (not shown). These results
indicated that Tag is not present in RPAII. The mobility of theRPAII complex was also unaffected by the addition of controlantibody against inﬂuenza hemagglutinin (lanes 7–9), butwas supershifted to a slower mobility in the presence of
antibody against RPA32C (lanes 10 and 11). We conclude
that the RPAII complex observed at high RPA concentrationsis not a ternary complex with Tag. We believe that RPAII maycontain two or three RPA molecules bound to the 30-mer ina compact binding mode (Blackwell et al, 1996).
As Tag did not appear to form a stable ternary complex
with RPA and a 30-mer ssDNA, we asked whether directphysical interaction between Tag and RPA was necessary to
stimulate ssDNA binding to RPA. To address this question,additional mobility shift assays were carried out with RPA
from budding yeast, which binds ssDNA but not Tag
(Melendy and Stillman, 1993). In these experiments, ssDNAbinding of yeast RPA was unaffected by Tag (Figure 6D, lanes2–7), arguing that at least a transient Tag interaction with RPAis required to enhance RPA binding to a 30-mer. To further
assess the role of Tag–RPA interaction in facilitating RPA
binding to ssDNA, the previously discussed mutant Tag(R154E) with reduced afﬁnity for RPA70AB (Figure 5D) wastested in mobility shift experiments (Figure 6E). Tag R154Eretained the ability to stimulate RPA binding to dT
30, but its
activity was clearly reduced (Figure 6E, compare lanes 3 and
6). The results in Figures 6D and E indicate that the ability
of Tag to facilitate RPA binding to a 30-nucleotide ssDNAcorrelates with Tag–RPA afﬁnity.
Discussion
We have shown here for the ﬁrst time that during activationof a simple model pre-replication complex, origin DNA un-winding is directly coupled to RPA loading on the emergingssDNA, and that physical interaction of the pre-replicationprotein Tag with RPA70AB, but not RPA32C, is required for
this novel coupling (Figure 2). The interaction surfaces of

X Jiang et al
&2006 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 25 |NO 23 |2006 5521Tag-OBD and RPA70AB have been mapped, revealing a strong
electrostatic component. Formation of a stable ternary com-
plex composed of RPA, an 8-mer ssDNA, and Tag has been
demonstrated (Figures 3–6). However, RPA binding to a 15- to30-mer ssDNA was shown to lead to dissociation of Tag fromthe ternary complex (Figure 6), completing the RPA loadingprocess.
The structural perspective provided in this study signiﬁ-
cantly advances our understanding of the complex interplaybetween RPA and Tag during DNA unwinding. The ability ofRPA to bind simultaneously to Tag and an 8-mer ssDNA ina ternary complex demonstrates that Tag and ssDNA do notcompete directly for RPA. Our evidence suggests that disso-
ciation of Tag from the ternary complex in the presence of
15- to 30-nucleotide ssDNA involves allosteric remodelingof RPA quaternary structure from a compact 8-nucleotidebinding mode into an extended ssDNA binding mode thatweakens Tag binding. The precise nature of these conforma-
tional changes is currently under investigation.
The ternary complex: a coupling device for protein-
mediated RPA loading during DNA unwindingOur new results suggest a simple two-step model for Tag-mediated RPA loading on ssDNA as it emerges from the active
helicase (Figure 7A). Once the Tag hexamer is active, it moves3
0–50on ssDNA, displacing the complementary strand. Based
on the recent crystal structure of the closely related papillo-
mavirus E1 helicase domain in complex with ssDNA
(Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006), the displaced strandwould emerge close to the Tag-OBD (Figure 7A, top). Ourmodel suggests that the basic RPA70AB-binding surface of aTag-OBD would be exposed to the exterior as the helicase
moves, positioning it to bind RPA. An exposed basic surface
of Tag-OBD was recently noted in the crystal structure ofhexameric Tag-OBD in an open spiral (Meinke et al, 2006).
Based on our ﬁndings, formation of the ternary complexwould occur upon the extrusion of 8–10 nucleotides ofssDNA. Continued helicase action ( B200 nucleotides/min)
(Murakami and Hurwitz, 1993) would rapidly generate a
30-nucleotide stretch of ssDNA, allowing RPA to bind in anextended ssDNA binding mode that weakens binding to Tag-OBD and leads to Tag release (Figure 7A, bottom). Thissimple model depicts an initial and a ﬁnal step in loading
each RPA molecule, but is not meant to rule out the possible
existence of intermediate steps.
During initiation of SV40 DNA replication (Bullock, 1997;
Simmons, 2000; Fanning and Pipas, 2006), a similar structur-al mechanism may couple origin DNA unwinding with RPA
loading on the emerging ssDNA, as depicted in Figure 7B.
SV40 DNA replication begins with the assembly of a simple

presence of ATP on the central palindrome of the viral origin,nucleated by sequence-speciﬁc contacts of two subunits in
each hexamer with the four pentanucleotides in the palin-
drome (arrows in Figure 7B). Assembly of the double hex-amer is accompanied by remodeling of contacts between Tagsubunits, both in the helicase domain and in the N-terminaland OBD domains (Smelkova and Borowiec, 1998; Weisshartet al, 1999, 2004; Li et al, 2003; Gai et al, 2004a, b; Meinke
et al, 2006; Valle et al, 2006). This remodeling gives rise to
distortion of the duplex DNA, generating an 8-nucleotidebubble in the EP region and an untwisted AT region at theopposite end of the origin (Figure 7B) (Borowiec andHurwitz, 1988). The single-stranded bubble thus represents
an early intermediate in the unwinding reaction catalyzed bythe double hexamer and marks the origin of bidirectional
replication from which the two leading strands initiate and
diverge (Hay and DePamphilis, 1982).
Interestingly, the ability of heterologous ssDNA-binding
proteins to bind to a synthetic 8-nucleotide ssDNA-bubblesubstrate correlates with their ability to support SV40 originDNA unwinding by Tag (Iftode and Borowiec, 1997, 1998),
suggesting a possible role for RPA binding to such a bubble
during unwinding. We propose that origin distortion leads toextrusion of an ssDNA bubble near the OBDs and to exposureof at least one OBD surface from each hexamer (Gai et al,
2004b; Meinke et al, 2006; Valle et al, 2006), enabling the
formation of a ternary complex of RPA and Tag-OBD with the
ssDNA bubble (Figure 7C). Thus, as noted for RPA loading onemergent ssDNA from the active helicase, the ternary com-plex would physically couple origin unwinding with RPAloading. As origin DNA unwinding progresses, more ssDNAwould be extruded from the double hexamer (Wessel et al,
1992; Murakami and Hurwitz, 1993; Fanning, 1994;
Smelkova and Borowiec, 1998; Alexandrov et al , 2002).
Repetition of the unwinding and RPA loading cycle to gen-erate enough template for replisome assembly would set thestage for Tag-mediated RPA displacement and DNA polymer-
ase alpha-primase loading to initiate leading strand synthesis
(Arunkumar et al, 2005).
Although this model is speculative, it allows several pre-
viously unexplained observations to be rationalized. Forexample, excess yeast RPA is unable to compete effectively
with human RPA in SV40 initiation (Figure 2D), which can be
explained by the fact that the ssDNA-bubble complex boundto yeast RPA could not be stabilized in a ternary complex withTag. Our model also offers an explanation for the previouslypuzzling observation that a monoclonal antibody againstRPA70 (Mab70C) inhibits SV40 origin DNA unwinding even
though Mab70C does not inhibit ssDNA binding of RPA
(Kenny et al, 1990). Notably, Mab70C binds to the same
region of RPA70AB that interacts with Tag-OBD (Gomes andWold, 1996) and presumably inhibits ternary complex for-mation with Tag, thereby inhibiting origin unwinding.
Our proposal of a ternary complex of RPA70AB, Tag, and
an 8-mer as the initial step in protein-mediated RPA loadingon ssDNA is fully consistent with the sequential bindingmechanism of RPA domains A–D to ssDNA that was proposedfor puriﬁed RPA (Bochkareva et al, 2002; Arunkumar et al,
2003; Wyka et al, 2003). Protein-mediated RPA loading on
emerging ssDNA offers obvious advantages over diffusion-
mediated loading on pre-existing ssDNA, as the ssDNA wouldbe continuously protected from nucleases and potential hair-pin formation from the time of its creation until the restora-tion of the duplex structure. Moreover, protein-mediated RPA
loading on ssDNA offers the potential to create a regular,
ordered array of RPA on ssDNA that may facilitate subsequentDNA processing more effectively than diffusion-mediatedRPA loading on free ssDNA. The structural resemblance ofthe simple SV40 pre-replication complex to MCM double
hexamers in the more elaborate eukaryotic pre-replication
complex (Forsburg, 2004; Sclafani et al, 2004) is intriguing in
this context. Our results provide strong motivation to deter-mine whether DNA unwinding at chromosomal pre-replica-tion complexes may also be coupled with RPA loading.
Figure 7 Proposed mechanism for coupling activation of the SV40
pre-replication complex with RPA loading on ssDNA. ( A) An active
Tag hexamer (OBD and N-terminus in gold; helicase domains in
turquoise) translocating 30to 50on the red strand (dotted line) and
displacing the blue strand is proposed to form a ternary complex, inwhich Tag-OBD binds to RPA70AB (orange) associated with 8–10nucleotides of ssDNA. As more DNA is unwound, RPA extends intothe 30-nucleotide binding mode on ssDNA and releases Tag-OBD.(B) Tag monomers recognize four speciﬁc binding sites (black
arrows) in the origin DNA, nucleating double hexamer assembly
and inducing an ssDNA bubble at the ﬂanking EP sequence anddistortion at AT. The depicted path of DNA through the Tag doublehexamer is speculative (Gai et al, 2004b; Li et al, 2003; Valle et al,
2006). ( C) Remodeling of the Tag N-terminus and Tag-OBD (Meinke
et al, 2006; Valle et al, 2006) in the presence of human RPA is
proposed to facilitate formation of a ternary complex composed of
RPA70AB bound to an ssDNA bubble and to a basic OBD surfaceexposed on the exterior of each hexamer, analogous to that shownin (A). As the helicase translocates (dotted lines) and more ssDNAemerges, RPA would extend into the 30-nucleotide binding mode onssDNA (orange arrows) and dissociate from Tag, completing theloading cycle.Activation of the SV40 pre-replication complex

Protein and DNA
Human RPA70AB was expressed and puriﬁed as described(Arunkumar et al, 2003). Tag
131–259 (Tag-OBD), and recombinant
trimeric human RPA, yeast RPA, and hRPAy32C chimera were
expressed and puriﬁed as described (Arunkumar et al, 2005). SV40
Tag, DNA polymerase alpha-primase, and topoisomerase I wereprepared as described (Ott et al, 2002). Monoclonal antibodies
Pab101 against Tag (residues 696–708) (Weisshart et al, 2004) and
70C and 34A against hRPA (Kenny et al, 1990) were puriﬁed as
described. HPLC pure oligo dT
30,d T 15, and dT 8were purchased
from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA)
Uniformly enriched15N and13C,15N samples were prepared in
minimal medium containing 1 g/l15NH4Cl (CIL Inc.) and 2 g/l
unlabeled or [13C6]glucose (CIL Inc.), respectively. HPLC pure
ssDNA, d(C) 8, was purchased from Midland Certiﬁed Co. (Midland,
TX) and used without further puriﬁcation.
NMR spectroscopy
All NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance spectro-meters operating at 600 and 800 MHz. The buffer that was used forall the NMR experiments was 20 mM Tris-d
11HCl containing 50 mM
KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM DTT, and 0.01% NaN 3at pH 7.2. All NMR
experiments were recorded at 25 1C. Two-dimensional, gradient-
enhanced HSQC and TROSY-HSQC spectra were recorded with 4K
complex data points in the1H and 200 complex points in15N
dimension. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed usingFelix 2000 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Complete backbone andside-chain assignments for RPA70AB and Tag-OBD are reportedelsewhere (Luo et al, 1996; Bhattacharya et al, 2004). Structures
were visualized and ﬁgures were generated using MOLMOL (Koradi
et al, 1996).
Limited proteolysis
Limited proteolysis of RPA70AB was carried out in the presence oftrypsin at a molar ratio of 1:1000 (protease:protein) in the samebuffer that was used in NMR studies. Free RPA70AB, binary
complexes RP70AB/Tag-OBD and RPA70AB/d(C)
8, and the ternary
RPA70AB/Tag-OBD/d(C) 8complex were incubated in the presence
of trypsin and aliquots were removed at various time points. Theprotease activity was quenched by addition of SDS–PAGE loadingbuffer followed by boiling for 3 min. The digestion products wereseparated and visualized by 4–17% SDS–PAGE and Coomassiestaining.
Tag-RPA pull-down assays
Puriﬁed Tag was bound to monoclonal antibody Pab101 absorbed toprotein G-agarose beads. Tag-bound beads were incubated with RPAor RPA70AB as indicated in the ﬁgure legends for 1 h at 4 1C. After
washing three times with washing buffer (30 mM HEPES–KOH (pH
7.9), 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl
2, 0.25% inositol, 0.05% NP-40), the
beads were resuspended in the SDS sample buffer and analyzedby SDS–PAGE and Western blotting with anti-RPA Mab70C andchemiluminescence. hRPA and RPA70AB binding to GST-Tag-OBDadsorbed to glutathione beads was assayed in a similar mannerusing anti-Tag Pab101.
In some experiments, increasing amounts of oligonucleotide
dT
30,d T 15,o rd T 8were added to the washed Tag/RPA complexes
on beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 1C. After washing again with
washing buffer, bound hRPA was visualized by SDS–PAGE,immunoblotting with anti-RPA Mab70C (Kenny et al, 1990), and
chemiluminescence.
ssDNA ﬁlter binding assays
Human RPA, yeast RPA ,or hRPAy32C was incubated with 3 pmol of5
032P-end-labeled ssDNA (dT 30) in binding buffer (30 mM HEPES–
KOH (pH 7.9), 40 mM creatine phosphate, 7 mM MgCl 2,4m MA T P ,
10mM ZnCl 2) for 20 min at 37 1C. Reactions were spotted on
alkaline-treated nitrocellulose ﬁlters (McEntee et al, 1980). The
ﬁlters were washed ﬁve times with wash buffer (30 mM HEPES–
KOH (pH 7.9), 7 mM MgCl 2), dried, and analyzed by scintillation
counting.
Native gel electrophoresis
Mobility shift reaction mixtures (15 ml) containing 3 pmol of 5032P-
end labeled ssDNA (dT 30) in binding buffer (30 mM HEPES–KOH
(pH 7.9), 40 mM creatine phosphate, 7 mM MgCl 2,4 m MA T P ,
0.01 mM ZnCl 2) were pre-incubated with 2–6 pmol of RPA (human
or yeast) as indicated in the ﬁgure legends at 25 1C for 10 min. Tag
was added as indicated in the ﬁgure legends for 15 min at 37 1C.
In some experiments, a puriﬁed monoclonal antibody was added5 min later. The reaction products were analyzed after addition of
loading buffer (2.5% w/v Ficoll 400, 0.05% w/v bromophenol blue,
0.05% w/v xylene cyanol) and electrophoresis on 7.5% poly-acrylamide gels in 45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, and 0.01 mMZnCl
2for 2 h at 100 V . The gel was dried and complexes were
detected by autoradiography. Bound proteins were quantiﬁed bydensitometry using IPLabGel.
Initiation of SV40 DNA replication
Monopolymerase assays (Matsumoto et al, 1990) were carried out
as described recently (Arunkumar et al, 2005) except that 750 ng of
Tag was used and RPA was varied as indicated in the ﬁgure legends.Reactions were assembled at 4 1C and incubated at 37 1C for 90 min.
Reaction products were puriﬁed on G-50 Sephadex columns (RocheDiagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN) and precipitated with 100%
acetone. The washed and dried products were redissolved in
loading buffer (45% formamide, 5 mM EDTA, 0.08% xylene cyanolFF, 0.08% bromophenol blue) and resolved by 1.2% alkaline(30 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA) agarose gel electrophoresis for 2–3 h at100 V . The reaction products were visualized by autoradiographyand quantiﬁed by scintillation counting.

Abstract
The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into cells requires the sequential interaction of 
the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine 
receptor on the cell surface. These interactions initiate a fusion of the viral and cellular 
membranes. Although gpl20 can elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies, HIV eludes the immune 
system. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution of an HIV-1 gp120 core 
complexed with a two-domain fragment of human CD4 and an antigen-binding fragment of a 
neutralizing antibody that blocks chemokine-receptor binding. The structure reveals a cavity-laden 
CD4-gp120 interface, a conserved binding site for the chemokine receptor, evidence for a 
conformational change upon CD4 binding, the nature of a CD4-induced antibody epitope, and 
specific mechanisms for immune evasion. Our results provide a framework for understanding the 
complex biology of HIV entry into cells and should guide efforts to intervene.
The human immunodeficiency viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 and the related simian 
immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) cause the destruction of CD4+ lymphocytes in their 
respective hosts, resulting in the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript(AIDS)1,2. The entry of HIV into host cells is mediated by the viral envelope glycoproteins, 
which are organized into oligomeric, probably trimeric spikes displayed on the surface of the 
virion. These envelope complexes are anchored in the viral membrane by the gp41 
transmembrane envelope glycoprotein. The surface of the spike is composed primarily of the 
exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, associated by non-covalent interactions with each 
subunit of the trimeric gp41 glycoprotein complex3,4. Comparison of the gp120 sequences 
of different primate immunodeficiency viruses identified five variable regions (V1–V5) 
(ref. 5). The first four variable regions form surface-exposed loops that contain disulphide 
bonds at their bases6. The conserved gp120 regions form discontinuous structures important 
for the interaction with the gp41 ectodomain and with the viral receptors on the target cell. 
Both conserved and variable gp120 regions are extensively glycosylated6. The variability 
and glycosylation of the gp120 surface probably modulate the immunogenicity and 
antigenicity of the gp120 glycoprotein, which is the main target for neutralizing antibodies 
elicited during natural infection7.
Entry of primate immunodeficiency viruses into the host cell involves the binding of the 
gp120 envelope glycoprotein to the CD4 glycoprotein, which serves as the primary receptor. 
The gp120 glycoprotein binds to the most amino-terminal of the four immunoglobulin-like 
domains of CD4. Structures of both the N-terminal two domains8,9 and the entire 
extracellular portion of CD4 (ref. 10) have been determined, and mutagenesis indicates that 
the CD4 structure analogous to the second complementarity-determining region (CDR2) of 
immunoglobulins is critical for gp120 binding11,12. Conserved gp120 residues important for 
CD4 binding have likewise been identified by mutagenesis3,13,14.
CD4 binding induces conformational changes in the gp120 glycoprotein, some of which 
involve the exposure and/or formation of a binding site for specific chemokine receptors. 
These chemokine receptors, mainly CCR5 and CXCR4 for HIV-1, serve as obligate second 
receptors for virus entry15,16. The gp120 third variable (V3) loop is the principal 
determinant of chemokine receptor specificity17. However, other more conserved gp120 
structures that are exposed upon engagement of CD4 also seem to be involved in 
chemokine-receptor binding. This CD4-induced exposure is indicated by the enhanced 
binding of several gp120 antibodies18,19 which, like V3-loop antibodies, efficiently block 
the binding of gp120–CD4 complexes to the chemokine receptor20. These are called CD4-
induced (CD4i) antibodies. CD4 binding may trigger additional conformational changes in 
the envelope glycoproteins. For example, binding of CD4 to the envelope glycoproteins of 
some HIV-1 isolates induces the release, or ‘shedding’, of gp120 from the complex21, 
although the relevance of this process to HIV entry is uncertain.
HIV and related retroviruses belong to a class of enveloped fusogenic viruses that include 
corona-, paramyxo- and orthomyxo-viruses (e.g. influenza virus), all of which require post-
translational cleavage for activation. The transmembrane coat proteins of these viruses (gp41 
equivalents) share sequence similarity, particularly in their N-terminal fusion peptides, and 
they participate directly in membrane fusion. The ectodomain of gp41 can form a coiled coil 
resembling that of influenza haemagglutinin HA 2 (refs 3, 4, 22), supporting the idea that this 
class of viruses may share some common features of virus entry. In other respects, 
enveloped viruses tend to be distinctive. They use varying modes of entry (direct membrane Kwong et al. Page 2
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 October 06.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptpenetration for HIV , endocytosis for influenza virus) and even otherwise closely related 
viruses may use individualized receptors. The exterior coat proteins (gp120 equivalents) are 
accordingly specialized. Thus, for example, there is no detectable similarity in sequence, nor 
now in structure, between the receptor-binding portion of HIV and that of murine leukaemia 
virus23, another retrovirus. Mechanisms for receptor-mediated triggering of fusion may also 
be virus-specific.
Because of the important role of the gp120 glycoprotein in receptor binding and interactions 
with neutralizing antibodies, information about the gp120 structure is important for 
understanding HIV infection and for the design of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. 
Here we report the crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution of a partially deglycosylated HIV-1 
gp120 core bound to a two-domain fragment of the CD4 cellular receptor and to the antigen-
binding fragment (Fab) of an antibody, 17b, that is directed against a CD4i epitope. The 
accompanying Letter relates this structure to the antigenic properties of gp120 envelope 
proteins24.
Structure determination
Because of the extensive glycosylation and conformational heterogeneity associated with the 
HIV gp120 glycoprotein, we devised a crystallization strategy aimed at radical modification 
of the protein surface. We made truncations at termini and variable loops in various 
combinations with gp120 from various strains, extensively deglycosylated these gp120 
variants, and produced complexes with various ligands. A theoretical analysis indicated that 
the probability of crystal formation is greatly increased by such reduction of surface 
heterogeneity and trials with multiple variants25. After screening almost twenty 
combinations of gp120 variants and ligands, we obtained crystals25 of a ternary complex 
composed of a truncated form of gp120, the N-terminal two domains (DID2) of CD4, and a 
Fab from the human neutralizing monoclonal antibody 17b (ref. 18).
The gp120 crystallized was from the HXBc2 strain of HIV-1. It has deletions of 52 and 19 
residues from the N and C termini, respectively; Gly-Ala-Gly tripeptide substitutions for 67 
V1/V2 loop residues and 32 V3 loop residues; and the removal of all sugar groups beyond 
the linkages between the two core N-acetyl-glucosamine residues. This deglycosylated core 
gp120 is stripped of over 90% of the carbohydrate but it retains over 80% of the non-
variable-loop protein. Its capacity to interact with CD4 and relevant antibodies is preserved 
at or near wild-type levels26. The crystals are of space group P2221 (a = 71:6, b = 88:1, c = 
196:7 Å), with one ternary complex and 58% solvent in the crystallographic asymmetric 
unit.
The ternary structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement, isomorphous 
replacement and density modification techniques. It has been refined to an R-value of 21.0% 
(5−2:5 Å data > 2σ, R-free  = 30:3%). The final model, composed of 7,877 atoms, comprises 
residues 90–396 and 410–492 of gp120 (exceptloop substitutions), residues 1–181 of CD4, 
and residues 1– 213 of the light chain and 1–229 of the heavy chain of the 17b monoclonal 
antibody. In addition, 11 N-acetylglucosamine and 4 fucose residues, and 602 water Kwong et al. Page 3

CD4 and Fab 17b is as shown in Fig. 1.
Structure of gp120
The deglycosylated core of gp120 as dissected from the ternary complex approximates a 
prolate ellipsoid with dimensions of 50 × 50 × 25 Å, although its overall profile is more 
heart-shaped than circular. Its backbone structure is shown in Fig. 2a, c in an orientation 
precisely perpendicular to that in Fig. 1 (Fig. 4e shows a mutually perpendicular view). This 
core gp120 comprises 25 β-strands, 5 α-helices and 10 defined loop segments, all organized 
with the topology shown in Fig. 2b. Specific spans of structural elements are given in Fig. 
2d. The structure confirms the chemically determined disulphide-bridge assignments6 (Fig. 
2c). The polypeptide chain of gp120 is folded into two major domains, plus certain 
excursions that emanate from this body. The inner domain (inner with respect to the N and C 
termini) features a two-helix, two-strand bundle with a small five-stranded β-sandwich at its 
terminiproximal end and a projection at the distal end from which the V1/ V2 stem 
emanates. The outer domain is a stacked double barrel that lies alongside the inner domain 
so that the outer barrel and inner bundle axes are approximately parallel.
The proximal barrel of the outer-domain stack is composed from a six-stranded, mixed-
directional β-sheet that is twisted to embrace helix α2 as a seventh barrel stave. The distal 
barrel of the stack is a seven-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. The two barrels share one 
contiguous hydrophobic core, and the staves also continue from one barrel to the next except 
at the domain interface. This interruption is centred at a side between barrels where the 
chain enters the outer domain, with loop ℒB insinuated as a tongue between strands β16 and 
β23. The extended segment just preceding ℒB is like an eighth stave of the distal barrel, but 
is slightly out of reach for hydrogen bonding with its β16 and β19 neighbours. The chain 
returns to complete the inner domain after β24.
The proximal end of the outer domain includes variable loops V4 and V5 and loops ℒD and 
ℒE, which are variable in sequence as well. Loop ℒC is also at this end, close in space to 
loop ℒA of the inner domain, although by topology it is at the other end of this domain. The 
distal end does include the base of the excised variable loop V3 and also an excursion via 
loop ℒF into a β-hairpin, β20–β21, which in turn hydrogen-bonds with the V1/V2 stem 
emanating from the inner domain. This completes an antiparallel, four-stranded ‘bridging 
sheet’ which stands as a peculiar minidomain in contact with, but distinct from, the inner 
and outer domains as well as the excised V1/V2 domain. This bridging sheet also 
participates in the spatially separated interactions of gp120 with both CD4 and the 17b 
antibody (Fig. 1, and see below). One further excursion from the body of the outer domain 
produces strand β15 and helix α3, which are also important in CD4 binding.
Taken as a whole, the structure of gp120 seen here has no precedent. Moreover, our domain-
level searches have failed to reveal similarity of the inner domain to any known atomic 
structures, although the missing terminal segments might conceal relationships. We do, 
however, find fragmentary similarity for portions of the outer domain with known structures. 
In particular, part of the protomer of FabA dehydrase27 is like part of the proximal barrel, Kwong et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptand dUTP pyrophosphatase28 has elements in common with both barrels of the outer 
domain. In each case, the superimposable fraction is limited. For FabA, 45 of its 171 C α 
atoms superimpose on five segments, but the rest are topologically unrelated. For dUTPase, 
41 of its 152 C α atoms appropriately capture 8 of the 15 segments in the outer domain body, 
but there is no helix corresponding to α2 and the placements of termini are not comparable. 
Several viruses related to HIV encode dUTPases; however, we have not found sequence 
evidence to support a role in coat protein evolution.
This structure of core gp120 should be a prototype for the class. As shown in the structure-
based alignment of representative sequences (Fig. 2d), there is substantial conservation 
despite the noted variability among HIV strains. Thus, even an HIV-2 sequence is 35% 
identical with that of the HXBc2 strain expressed in this crystallized construct, and the 
identity rises to 77 and 51%, respectively, for the more closely related HIV-1 clade C and 
clade O representatives. The inner domain is appreciably more conserved than the outer 
domain, with 86, 72 and 45% identity for the C, O and HIV-2 comparisons, respectively. 
Variability correlates with the degree of solvent exposure of residues (Fig. 2d), in keeping 
with the conservation of hydrophobic cores. The seven disulphide bridges retained in core 
gp120 are absolutely conserved and mostly buried (Fig. 2c). Glycosylation sites are all 
surface-exposed and are conserved more than average (Fig. 2d). The previously identified 
HIV variable segments5 are all on loops connecting elements of secondary structure, and 
loops ℒD and ℒE are also especially variable. Indeed, ℒE is more variable than V5 in light 
of current sequence data. These loops are also relatively mobile, as reflected in high B-
factors or disorder, as in V4. Variable segments in the outer domain, including the exposed 
face of α2, appear to arise from neutral mutation rather than selective pressure, because they 
are on non-immunogenic surfaces24, presumably masked by glycosylation.
CD4-gp120 interaction
CD4 is bound into a depression formed at the interface of the outer domain with the inner 
domain and the bridging sheet of gp120 (Fig. 3a). This interaction buries a total of 742 Å2 
from CD4 and 802 Å2 from gp120. The surface areas that are actually in contact are 
considerably smaller (Fig. 3d) because an unusual mismatch in surface topography creates 
large cavities that are occluded in the interface, as described below. There is, however, a 
general complementarity in electrostatic potential at the surfaces of contact, although the 
match is imprecise in this respect as well. The focus of CD4 positivity is displaced from the 
centre of greatest negativity on gp120 (Fig. 3c). The binding site is devoid of carbohydrate 
(Fig. 3g). The structure of CD4 in this complex differs only locally from that in free D1D2 
structures and at only a few places: residues 17–20 at the poorly ordered CDR1-like loop 
and residues 41, 42, 47, 49 and 60, which are at or near the contact site and have low B 
factors in the gp120-bound state.
Direct interatomic contacts are made between 22 CD4 residues and 26 gp120 amino-acid 
residues. These include 219 van der Waals contacts and 12 hydrogen bonds. Residues in 
contact are concentrated in the span from 25 to 64 of CD4, but they are distributed over six 
segments of gp120 (Figs 2d and 3i): one residue from the V1/V2 stem, loop ℒD, the β15–
α3 excursion, the β20–β21 hairpin, strand β23 and the β24–α5 connection. These Kwong et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptinteractions are compatible with previous analyses of mutational data on both CD4 
(refs 11, 12, 29) and gp120 (refs 3, 13, 14). Other groups are also involved, including some at 
gp120 sites that have not been tested, but residues identified as critical for binding do indeed 
interact with one another (Fig. 3e). Most important, Phe 43 and Arg59 of CD4 make 
multiple contacts centred on residues Asp 368, Glu 370 and Trp 427 of gp120, which are all 
conserved among primate immunodeficiency viruses. In fact, 63% of all interatomic contacts 
come from one span (40–48) in C ′C″ of CD4, and Phe43 alone accounts for 23% of the 
total. Similarly, with respect to gp120, the spans of 365–371 and 425–430 contribute 57% of 
the total. Of the three CD4 lysine residues implicated in binding (residues 29, 35 and 46), 
only Lys29 makes a direct ionic hydrogen bond, and although Asp 457 of gp120 is near to 
these electropositive groups (Fig. 3e, i), it does not make hydrogen bonds.
Several gp120 residues that are covered by CD4 are variable in sequence. This variation is 
accommodated in part by the large interfacial cavity (Fig. 3e). The gp120 residues in contact 
with this water-filled cavity are especially variable (Fig. 3g). Moreover, half of the gp120 
residues that make contacts with CD4 do so only through main-chain atoms (including C β) 
of gp120, and 60% of CD4 contacts are made by gp120 main-chain atoms (Fig. 3f). 
Included among these are 5 of the 12 hydrogen bonds in the interface. One such contributing 
element is an antiparallel ß-sheet alignment of CD4 strand C ″ with gp120 strand β15 (Fig. 
3a, i).
Atomic details of the interaction are particularly intricate and unusual for the contacts made 
between gp120 and the mutationally critical CD4 residues Phe43 and Arg 59 (Fig. 3j). Arg 
59 interacts with Asp 368 and Val 430. The carboxylate group of Asp 368 makes double 
hydrogen-bonds with the guanidinium N η atoms of Arg 59, but it also hydrogen-bonds back 
to the backbone NH group of residue 44 and it appears to be optimally positioned to receive 
a CH…O hydrogen bond (3.20Å) from the Phe43 ring. Phe43 interacts with residues Glu 
370, Ile 371, Asn425, Met 426, Trp427 and Gly473, as well as Asp 368, but only the 
contacts with Ile 371 have a conventional hydrophobic character. Those to 425–427 and 473, 
including Trp 427, are only to backbone atoms. A surprisingly large fraction of the Phe43 
contacts (28%) are to polar atoms. The phenyl group is stacked on the carboxylate group of 
Glu 370, and there are contacts with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues 425, 426 and 
473 and the NH group of Trp 427. One of these, from the phenyl ring to O 425, is a second 
candidate CH…O hydrogen bond (3.10A). Asp 368 and Glu 370 have their carboxylate 
groups close together (3.54Å) and they are, of course, buried in the complex. Even for gp120 
excised from the complex, their fractional surface accessibilities are only 44 and 14%, 
respectively. Glu 370 may therefore be protonated. Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of 
this site is the large cavity beyond C ζ of Phe 43 (Fig. 3b, h, and see below).
Interfacial cavities
Analysis of the solvent-accessible surface of the ternary complex reveals a number of 
topologically interior surfaces or cavities. Two of these, both at the gp120–CD4 interface, 
are unusually large. The larger (279 Å3) is formed at the interface between the slightly 
concave middle of the CC ′C″ portion of the CD4 sheet and a groove on gp120, where β23 
and β24 are indented relative to β15 and the ℒD loop (Fig. 3e). The second is from a pocket Kwong et al. Page 6
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 October 06.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptin the gp120 surface that is plugged by Phe 43 from CD4 (152 Å3). This pocket is itself at 
the interface between the inner and outer domains of gp120 (Fig. 3h). Several other smaller 
cavities are also wedged at the interface between the two gp120 domains.
The larger cavity is lined mostly by hydrophilic residues, half derived from gp120 and half 
from CD4. It is not deeply buried; although it is formally a cavity in the crystal structure, 
minor changes in side-chain orientation could make it solvent-accessible. The observed 
electron density and predicted hydrogen bonding are consistent with at least eight water 
molecules in the cavity. Residues from gp120 that actually line the cavity (including Ala281, 
Ser 364, Ser 365, Thr455, Arg 469) show sequence variability, whereas surrounding this 
variable patch are conserved residues, the substitution of which affect CD4 binding. These 
include the critical contact residues Asp 368, Glu 370 and Trp 427, which flank one end of 
the cavity, and Asp 457 at the other end (Fig. 3e). Similarly, CD4 residues that line the 
cavity (such as Gln 40 and Lys 35) can be mutated with only moderate effect on gp120 
binding, whereas Arg 59 suffers less loss of solvent-accessible surface upon gp120 binding 
but is highly sensitive to mutation. This cavity thus serves as a water buffer between gp120 
and CD4 (Fig. 3e). The tolerance for variation in the gp120 surface associated with this 
cavity produces a variational island (Fig. 3g), or ‘anti-hotspot’, which is centrally located 
between regions required for CD4 binding, and may help the virus escape from antibodies 
directed against the CD4-binding site.
The ‘Phe 43’ cavity (Fig. 3b, h) is very different in character from the larger binding-
interface cavity. It is roughly spherical, with a diameter of ~8Å (atom centre to atom centre) 
across the centre of the cavity. It is positioned just beyond Phe 43 of CD4, at the intersection 
of the inner domain, the outer domain and the bridging sheet. It is deeply buried, extending 
into the hydrophobic interior of gp120. The phenyl ring of Phe 43 is the only non-gp120 
residue contacting this cavity, forming a lid that covers the bottom of the cavity (Fig. 3b). 
Other routes of solvent access are possible: past Met 426 under the bridging sheet, or 
directly through the heart of gp120, at the interface between the inner and outer domains. 
Ordered water molecules demarking possible paths of solvent access are found along both 
routes. Nonetheless, in the cavity itself only a few water molecules are seen. The centre of 
the cavity is dominated by a large piece of spherical density, which is over 4 A from any 
protein atom (Fig. 3b). The size, shape and predicted hydrogen bonding of this density is 
inconsistent with those expected for water, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, or any of the other 
major crystallization components. We have not identified the source of this density.
Residues that line the Phe43 cavity (Trp 112, Val255, Thr257, Glu 370, Phe 382, Tyr 384, 
Trp 427 and Met 475; only main chains of 256 and 375–377) are primarily hydrophobic. 
They are also highly conserved, as much so as the buried gp120 hydrophobic core. Despite a 
lack of steric hindrance, almost no substitutions to larger residues are found. Given the 
frequency of gp120 sequence divergence, such conservation strongly implies functional 
significance. Indeed, although residues that line this cavity provide little direct contact to 
CD4, they do affect the gp120–CD4 interaction. Thus, mutations at Thr 257 (no contacts) 
and Trp 427 (only main-chain contacts) can substantially reduce binding. Changes in cavity-
lining residues also affect the binding of antibodies directed against the CD4-binding site24. 
In addition, many of the residues that line the cavity interact with elements of the Kwong et al. Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptchemokine-receptor-binding region (see below). It may be that the Phe 43 cavity and the 
other interdomain cavities form as a consequence of a CD4-induced conformational change 
(see below).
Despite the unusual cavity-laden interface between gp120 and CD4, we believe that this 
structure reflects the true character of the interaction. Core and full-length gp120 bind CD4 
with similar affinity26, and residues identified as critical by mutational analysis on both 
components are indeed at the focus of contact in the structure. In any case, the missing 
gp120 loops and termini could not conceivably have a role in filling these cavities.
Antibody interface
The 17b antibody is a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal isolated from the blood of an 
HIV-infected individual. It binds to a CD4-induced (CD4i) gp120 epitope that overlaps the 
chemokine-receptor-binding site20.
Relative to other antibody-antigen pairs the interface between Fab 17b and core gp120 in the 
ternary complex is small (Fig. 4a–c). The solvent-accessible area excluded upon binding is 
only 455 Å2 from gp120 and 445 Å2 from 17b, which is largely from the heavy chain 
(371Å2). The long (15 residue) complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the heavy 
chain dominates, but the heavy-chain CDR2 and the light-chain CDR3 also contribute. 
Overall, the 17b contact surface is very acidic (3 Asp, 3 Glu, no Arg or Lys), although 
hydrophobic contacts (notably a cis proline and tryptophan from the light chain) 
predominate at the centre.
On gp120, the 17b epitope lies across the base of the four-stranded bridging sheet (Fig. 4c, 
e). All four strands make substantial contact with 17b, suggesting that the integrity of the 
bridging sheet is necessary for 17b binding. The gp120 surface that contacts 17b consists of 
a hydrophobic centre surrounded by a highly basic periphery (3 Lys, 1 Arg, and no Asp or 
Glu) (Fig. 4d). Although this basic gp120 surface complements the acidic 17b surface, only 
one salt bridge is observed (between Arg 419 of gp120 and Glu 106 of the 17b heavy chain). 
The rest of the specific contacts occur between hydrophobic and polar residues. Thus, the 
interaction between 17b and gp120 involves a hydrophobic central region flanked on the 
periphery by charged regions, predominately acidic on 17b and basic on gp120. There are no 
direct CD4–17b contacts and none of the gp120 residues contacts both 17b and CD4. Rather, 
CD4 binds on the opposite face of the bridging sheet, providing specific contacts that seem 
to stabilize its conformation (Fig. 3i, j) and may explain, in part, the CD4 induction of 17b 
binding.
The 17b epitope is well conserved among HIV-1 isolates. Of the 18 residues that show a loss 
in solvent-accessible surface upon contact with 17b, 12 residues (67%) are conserved among 
all HIV-1 viruses. By contrast, only 19 of the 37 gp120 residues (51%) that show loss of 
solvent-accessible surface upon CD4 binding are similarly conserved. CD4i epitopes tend to 
be masked from immune surveillance by the adjacent V2 and V3 loops24. In the complex 
structure, a large gap is seen between gp120 and the tips of the light-chain CDR1 and CDR2 
loops. Pointing directly at this gap is the base of the V3 loop. In intact gp120, the variable Kwong et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptloops may need to be bypassed for access to the conserved structures in the bridging sheet. 
The 17b epitope may be further protected from the immune system by a CD4-induced 
conformational change (see below).
Chemokine-receptor site
The site of interaction with the chemokine receptor CCR5 overlaps with the 17b epitope30. 
Both are induced upon CD4 binding and both involve highly conserved residues. Mutational 
analysis showed that the basic and polar gp120 residues (Lys 121, Arg419, Lys421, Gln 422) 
that contact the 17b heavy chain also are important for CCR5 interaction30. The 
hydrophobic and acidic surface of the 17b heavy chain may mimic the tyrosine-rich, acidic 
N-terminal region of CCR5, which is important for gp120 binding and HIV-1 entry31,32. 
Geometrically, this site is directed at the cellular membrane when gp120 is engaged by CD4. 
Electrostatic interactions between the basic surface of the bridging sheet and the acidic 
chemokine receptor (and possibly the acid headgroups in the target membrane) could drive 
conformational changes related to virus entry.
Oligomer and gp41 interactions
Although monomeric in isolation, gp120 probably exists as a trimeric complex with gp41 on 
the virion surface. The large electroneutral surface on the inner domain (Fig. 3c) is the 
probable site of trimer packing based on its lack of glycosylation, its conservation in 
sequence, the location of CD4- and CCR5-binding sites, and the immune response to this 
region. These points are elaborated in the accompanying Letter and a model is presented24.
Mutagenic and antibody-binding analyses indicate that the N and C termini of full-length 
gp120 are the most important regions for interaction with the gp41 glycoprotein33,34. From 
these analyses, we expect that the gp41-interactive regions will extend away from core 
gp120 towards the viral membrane, and that the conserved, electroneutral surface is 
occluded in the oligomer/gp41 interface. A similar arrangement is seen in influenza 
haemagglutinin, where the extended N and C termini of HA 1 interact with the HA 2 
transmembrane protein35.
Conformational change in core gp120
There is abundant evidence to suggest that CD4 binding induces a conformational change in 
gp120, but much of it derives from intact gp120 with variable loops in place or from the 
oligomeric gp120–gp41 complex. The ternary complex structure provides clues to the nature 
of the conformational changes that occur within core gp120 itself. (Although 17b binding 
could contribute to the gp120 conformation observed in the crystal, the CD4 contacts are 
more extensive and multifaceted than those of 17b, indicating that CD4 binding may play 
the principal part in formation of the observed gp120 structure.)
Were the conformation of gp120 seen here preserved in the absence of CD4, the Phe 43 
cavity (now a pocket) would present a perplexing structural dilemma. As discussed above, 
the cavity-lining residues have few structural restrictions, with ample room for larger 
substitutions into the cavity, yet these residues are highly conserved and inexplicably Kwong et al. Page 9
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 October 06.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscripthydrophobic if exposed in a pocket. This pocket structure is in turn intimately connected to 
the bridging sheet, itself peculiar in absence of CD4. Thus, for example, the backbone amide 
of bridging-sheet residue 425 is hydrogen-bonded to Glu 370, a critical CD4 contact residue 
(Fig. 3j); Ile424 makes extensive hydrophobic contacts with Phe 382, which lines the pocket 
from the outer domain; and Trp427 packs perpendicular to Trp 112, which lines the pocket 
from the inner domain (Fig. 3b). N ε of Trp 427 is delicately poised for hydrogen bonding 
with the π-electrons of the indole ring of Trp 112. Structures such as these would 
necessarily be sensitive to orientational shifts between the inner and outer domains.
The characteristics of 17b binding to core gp120 provide additional evidence for a CD4-
induced conformational change. We do not observe detectable binding of Fab 17b to core 
gp120 unless CD4 is present, but then the ternary complex is stable in gel filtration. As there 
are no direct CD4–17b contacts in the structure, the effect of CD4 must be to stabilize the 
bridging-sheet minidomain to which 17b binds. This result is compatible with the binding 
properties of 17b and other CD4i antibodies to full-length gp120 (refs 18, 24), but it shows 
that the conformational change is not limited to an unmasking of the antibody epitope by 
CD4-induced displacement of the V2 loop, as was initially thought36. The ability of the 17b 
antibody to bind full-length gp120 in the absence of CD4, albeit with lower affinity, implies 
that structural elements required for 17b binding can be accessed in the absence of CD4. If 
we assume that 17b binds in the same way to both full-length and core gp120, as shown by 
the concordance between the structural contacts (Fig. 4) and epitope-mapping data30, then 
alternative conformations could be in a kinetically accessible equilibrium in native gp120.
A further indication that core gp120 may differ in the absence of CD4 comes from 
comparison with theory. When applied to the many known sequence variants of gp120, the 
evolutionary algorithm of PHD37 gives secondary-structure predictions with estimated 
reliability above 90% for roughly 45% of the core gp120 sequence. Compared with our 
structure, it is accurate except at three places where it is markedly wrong (four consecutive 
residues with reliability index greater than 90%). All of these are at the Phe 43 cavity or in 
contacts with CD4: loop ℒB, strand β15, and the segment of β20 into the turn to β21 (Fig. 
3h). Most significantly, the latter segment (residues 422–429) entering the bridging sheet is 
predicted to be helical. Indeed, residues 427–428 at the β20–β21 turn do have helical 
character. We also note that CD4 binds efficiently to a gp120 derivative having both β2 and 
β3 truncated38. As the bridging sheet is probably not stable in the absence of half of its 
strands, CD4 binding must be able to orientate strands β20 and β21 properly from a very 
different prior conformation.
The Phe 43 cavity is at the nexus of the CD4 interface, between the inner domain, the outer 
domain, and the bridging sheet. As such, Phe 43 itself seems to serve as a linchpin without 
which the structure might collapse. If so, to what state and, in reverse, how does CD4 
binding lead to the state seen in this ternary complex? CD4–gp120 binding kinetics are 
complex39, and microcalorimetry reveals unusually large Δ H and compensating TΔS values 
for soluble CD4 binding to gp120 (M. L. Doyle, personal communication). These 
exceptional CD4-binding thermodynamics are suggestive of a large conformational change 
and are similar for both full-length and core gp120, supporting the relevance of our 
structural observations on core gp120. We imagine that CD4 sees gp120 as an uneven Kwong et al. Page 10

3c), stabilizes a nascent complex state, and inserts Phe 43 to weld the cavity into place.
Viral evasion of immune responses
Analysis of the antigenic structure of gp120 shows that most of the envelope protein surface 
is hidden from humoral immune responses by glycosylation and oligomeric occlusion24. 
Most broadly neutralizing antibodies access only two surfaces: one that overlaps the CD4-
binding site (shielded by the V1/V2 loop), and another that overlaps the chemokine-
receptor-binding site (shielded by the V2 and V3 loops). Conformational changes in core 
gp120 provide additional mechanisms for evasion from immune surveillance. In the case of 
the CD4-binding surface, which contains a high proportion of main-chain atoms in the 
complex (Fig. 3f), the conformation without CD4 bound may expose underlying side-chain 
variability (Fig. 3g). Escape may also be provided by the recessed nature of the binding 
pocket (steric occlusion) (Fig. 3a) and by a topographical surface mismatch, which encloses 
a variational island or ‘anti-hotspot’ (described above; Fig. 3d). Mechanisms may be similar 
in the chemokine-receptor region: conformational change may hide the conserved epitope 
(unformed before CD4 binding); steric occlusion may take place between the CD4 anchored 
viral spike and the proximal target membrane; and an ‘anti-hotspot’ equivalent may 
camouflage chemokine-receptor-binding residues on the V3 loop in surrounding variability. 
Some of the means used to elude antibody-based defences may also help HIV avoid cellular 
immunity. Understanding the specific mechanisms of immune evasion may be prerequisite 
to the design of an effective vaccine.
Mechanistic implications for virus entry
During virus entry, HIV surface proteins fuse the viral membrane with the target cell 
membrane. gp120 is a crucial participant in the control and initiation of fusion. It functions 
in positioning: locating a cell capable of productive viral infection, anchoring the virus to the 
cell surface, and orienting the viral spike next to the target membrane. It also functions in 
timing: holding gp41 in a metastable conformation and triggering the coordinate release of 
the three N-terminal fusion peptides of the trimeric gp41. Although this is a complex, 
multiconformational process, the simplicity of the system, which comprises only two 
membranes, the viral oligomer and two host receptors, suggests that we may be able to 
understand the entire mechanism. Crystallography has now provided two snapshots: an 
intermediate state in which gp120 is bound to CD4, as described here, and a probably final, 
‘fusion-active’ state of the gp41 ectodomain40,41. Although atomic-level structures are 
lacking for other intermediates, the extensive biochemical data on membrane fusion 
mediated by HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins extend our understanding from these two states.
The entry process is initiated by binding of HIV-1 to the cellular receptor CD4 (Fig. 5, step 
1). Although the extracellular portion of CD4 has some segmental flexibility, this binding 
roughly orients the viral spike. This orientation can be simulated by an alignment of the 
D1D2 portion of CD4 in the ternary complex with the previously solved structure of the 
four-domain, entire extracellular portion of CD4 (ref. 10). Such alignment orients the N and 
C termini of core gp120 towards the viral membrane, while the 17b epitope/chemokine-Kwong et al. Page 11
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 October 06.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptreceptor-binding site on the gp120 surface faces the target cell membrane. Such an 
orientation is consistent with the proposed oligomeric structure and gp41-interactive 
surfaces (see above and ref. 24).
CD4 binding also induces conformational changes in gp120, which result in the creation of a 
metastable oligomer. Although some of the more flexible gp120 regions and gp41 are 
missing, the structure of the core gp120–CD4 complex presented here describes this state in 
atomic detail. CD4 binding results in movement of the V2 loop, which probably partially 
occludes the V3 loop and CD4i epitopes18,36. It also creates, or at least stabilizes, the 
bridging sheet on which the latter epitopes are located (described above). In addition, CD4 
binding appears to change the V3 region, with enhanced proteolytic susceptibility at the tip 
of the loop and altered exposure of V3 epitopes19. The uncovered V3 and CD4i epitopes 
make up the chemokine-receptor binding site. Thus CD4 binding not only orients the gp120 
surface implicated in chemokine receptor binding to face the target cell, it also forms and 
exposes the site itself. These changes may all happen in a single, concerted shift in the 
relative orientation of the inner and outer domains. This conformational shift may alter the 
orientation of the N and C termini, at the proximal end of the inner domain, perhaps partially 
destabilizing the oligomeric gp120/gp41 interface21. Such a shift would also alter the 
relative placement of the V1/V2 stem (in the CD4i site), which emanates from the inner 
domain, and the V3 loop, which emanates from the outer domain. Perhaps relevant to this, 
mutations that permit an adaptation of HIV-1 to CD4-independent entry using CXCR4 
involve sequence changes in both the V1/V2 stem and the V3 loop42.
The next step in HIV-1 entry is the interaction of the gp120–CD4 complex with the 
chemokine receptor (Fig. 5, step 2). Although interactions between CD4 and chemokine 
receptor may occur, mutagenic analysis (H. Choe and J. Sodroski, unpublished observations) 
and the known examples of CD4-independent virus entry or chemokine-receptor binding 
suggest that direct gp120 contacts dominate interaction with the chemokine receptor. As 
most of the chemokine receptor is encased in the host membrane, binding will move the 
gp120 bridging sheet close to the target membrane. This movement must require CD4 
flexibility because the initial HIV binding at the N-terminal D1 domains probably occurs 
above the glycocalyx. Reducing flexibility at the D2–D3 juncture or at the D4-membrane 
juncture of CD4 has been shown to block HIV-1 entry10,43.
Chemokine-receptor binding is believed to trigger additional conformational changes in the 
HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimer that lead to exposure of the gp41 ectodomain. 
Presumably, a signal is transmitted from the cell-associated distal end of gp120 to elements 
of the inner domain that are likely to be involved in gp120–gp41 or gp120–gp120 
association on the trimer. Although further interdomain shifts may occur in core gp120 after 
chemokine-receptor binding, the geometrically specific contacts that support the bridging 
sheet make it unlikely that another shift would occur without destabilizing this important 
component of the chemokine-receptor-binding site. As the high affinity of the interactions 
make it likely that both CD4 and chemokine receptor remain bound to gp120 during fusion, 
we expect additional conformational changes to occur between neighbouring gp120 
protomers in the oligomeric complex. Perhaps the chemokine receptor triggers gp41 
exposure by prising gp120 protomers away from the trimer axis, thus exerting a torque on Kwong et al. Page 12

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe gp120–gp41 interface. It is interesting that several of the substitutions that affect 
chemokine-receptor binding in the context of monomeric gp120 appear to induce gp120 
dissociation in an oligomeric context30.
The structure of the gp120/CD4/17b antibody ternary complex described here reveals many 
molecular aspects of HIV-1 entry, including the atomic structure of gp120, the explicit 
interactions with CD4, and the conserved site of binding for the chemokine receptor. Still 
unknown are details of the apo state of core gp120, the oligomeric structure, the interaction 
with the chemokine receptor, the conformational changes that trigger reorganization of the 
gp41 ectodomain, and the structural basis for insertion of the fusion peptide of gp41 into the 
target membrane. Further understanding will require snapshots of other intermediates. The 
conformational complexity and intricate domain associations of gp120, like those of reverse 
transcriptase44, the other large HIV translation product, may reflect genome restrictions at 
the protein level like those that lead to overlapping reading frames at the transcription level. 
Multiply protected infection machinery is contained in these condensed intricacies. Its 
mechanism frustrates host defences; understanding them may inspire medical intervention.
Methods
Protein production, crystallization and data collection
The two domain CD4 (D1D2, residues 1–182) was produced in Chinese hamster ovarian 
cells8, the monoclonal antibody 17b in an Epstein–Barr virus immortalized B-cell clone 
isolated from an HIV-1-infected individual and fused with a murine B-cell fusion partner18, 
and the core gp120 from Drosophila  Schneider 2 lines under the control of an inducible 
metallothionein promoter20. The various biochemical manipulations (such as 
deglycosylation for gp120 and papain digestion to produce Fab 17b), protein purification 
and ternary complex crystallization are described elsewhere25. The best crystals were small 
needles of cross-section only 30–40 μm. These were crosslinked by vapour-diffusion 
glutaraldehyde treatment (C. J. Lusty, personal communication), equilibrated with 
cryoprotectant containing stabilizer (10% ethylene glycol with 10.5% monomethyl-
PEG5000, 10% isopropanol, 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM citrate/ HEPES buffer, pH 6.3), 
transferred into immiscible oil (Paratone-N; Exxon), suspended in a small ethylene loop at 
the end of a mounting pin and flash-frozen in a cryostat nitrogen stream at 100 K.
Diffraction data were collected at beamline X4A, Brookhaven National Laboratory, using 
phosphorimaging plates and a Fuji BAS2000 scanner. To avoid overlap problems from the 
relatively high mosaicity (~1.0°), oscillation data were collected using a rotation axis that 
was offset at least 30° from the 197 Å c axis. Although crystals initially diffracted to Bragg 
spacings of greater than 2 Å, b axis mosaicity and substantial radiation damage, despite 
cryogenic cooling, reduced the overall limit to ~2.5Å. Data processing and reduction were 
achieved using DENZO and SCALEPACK45 (Table 1).
Structure determination and refinement
To locate the position of the Fab 17b in the ternary complex crystals, rotational searches 
with 52 different Fab models were made with the program MERLOT (P. M. Fitzgerald). The Kwong et al. Page 13
Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 October 06.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptFab fragments were aligned by superposition of their variable domains to allow comparison 
of rotational solutions. Even though four models showed more than 10% discrimination 
between the highest and second-highest solutions, no consistent rotational solution was 
found. Discrimination between correct and incorrect solutions was achieved by using 
confirmatory searches with the variable portion of the Fab. This was successful with only 
one model, molecule B of 1hil. Rigid-body refinement of the 1hil solution (XPLOR46), 
allowing each immunoglobulin domain to move independently, produced a Patterson 
correlation of 24.9%. To locate the position of the two-domain CD4, each of the top 100 
possible rotational solutions with each of three different CD4 models (1cdi, 1cdh, 3cd4), 
were searched for a distinctive translation solution (AMoRe; J. Navaza). The translation 
searches used the rigid body refined Fab as a partial structure to help discriminate the correct 
solution. Two distinctive solutions were found: the 25th rotational solution of 3cd4 gave a 
translation correlation of 0.171 (versus 0.128 for the second-highest translation solution), 
and the 61st rotational solution of 1cdh gave 0.149 (versus 0.140). These two solutions were 
virtually identical. Rigid-body refinement in XPLOR46 gave a Patterson correlation of 7.9% 
for CD4 alone and 32.4% for Fab and CD4. All molecular replacement and rigid-body 
refinements used 8–4 Å data.
To provide additional phasing, crystals were soaked in over 20 different heavy-atom 
solutions and screened for isomorphous replacement using the statistical chi-squared test in 
SCALEPACK45. Derivatives were identified from two heavy-atom compounds: 10 mM 
K3IrCl 6 (10 h equilibration in a solution containing the heavy atom and cryoprotectant 
stabilizer; 2.8 Å) and 5mM K 2OsCl 6 (24 h soak; 3.5 Å). Isomorphism was found to be 
highest between these heavy-atom data sets and a native data set collected at pH 7.0 
(cryoprotectant stabilizer buffered with 50mM bis-Tris, pH 7.0). Heavy-atom sites were 
identified by difference Fourier analysis using the molecular replacement phases, and 
phasing parameters were refined with MLPHARE (in the CCP4 suite of crystallographic 
programs). The K 3IrCl 6 derivative was modelled as nine partially occupied sites: two sites of 
occupancy 0.158 and 0.142, and seven of less than 0.07. Although relatively isomorphous, 
poor data quality ( Rsym of more than 20% past 3.0 Å) combined with relatively small 
isomorphous differences ( Riso of 12.0%) reduced the quality of phasing. In contrast, the 
K2OsC 16 derivative had an Risoof 15.6%, but was only isomorphous to ~5Å. It was modelled 
as four sites of occupancy 0.321, 0.207, 0.194 and 0.128, with the highest site at the same 
position as the second-highest site from K 3IrCl 6.
The initial combination of model and isomorphous replacement phasing did not produce 
readily interpretable density for gp120. To monitor phase improvem",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to understand the conformational changes in the HIV gp120 glycoprotein induced by CD4 binding.,"Research Hypothesis:
The conformational changes induced by CD4 binding in the HIV gp120 glycoprotein will reveal key structural elements that are critical for immune evasion and virus entry.

Research Proposal:
We propose to investigate the conformational changes in the HIV gp120 glycoprotein induced by CD4 binding using a combination of structural biology techniques, including X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis studies. By determining the atomic-level structure of the gp120-CD4 complex and analyzing the conformational changes, we aim to identify specific regions and residues involved in immune evasion and virus entry.

AbstractHER2 (also known as Neu, ErbB2) is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; also known as ErbB) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which in humans includes HER1 (EGFR, ERBB1), HER2, HER3 (ERBB3) and HER4 (ERBB4)1. ErbB receptors are essential mediators of cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing embryo and in adult tissues2, and their inappropriate activation is associated with the development and severity of many cancers3. Overexpression of HER2 is found in 20–30% of human breast cancers, and correlates with more aggressive tumours and a poorer prognosis4. Anticancer therapies targeting ErbB receptors have shown promise, and a monoclonal antibody against HER2, Herceptin (also known as trastuzumab), is currently in use as a treatment for breast cancer5. Here we report crystal structures of the entire extracellular regions of rat HER2 at 2.4 Å and human HER2 complexed with the Herceptin antigen-binding fragment (Fab) at 2.5 Å. These structures reveal a fixed conformation for HER2 that resembles a ligand-activated state, and show HER2 poised to interact with other ErbB receptors in the absence of direct ligand binding. Herceptin binds to the juxtamembrane region of HER2, identifying this site as a target for anticancer therapies.

Key Points
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric protein that consists of two proteins — HIF-1α and HIF-1β. HIF-1 activates the transcription of many genes that code for proteins that are involved in angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, cell proliferation/survival and invasion/metastasis.
HIF-1α protein synthesis is regulated by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. These pathways can be activated by signalling via receptor tyrosine kinases, non-receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors.
HIF-1α protein degradation is regulated by O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation, which targets the protein for ubiquitylation by E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. These ligases contain the von Hippel–Lindau tumour-suppressor protein (VHL), which binds specifically to hydroxylated HIF-1α. Ubiquitylated HIF-1α is rapidly degraded by the proteasome.
HIF-1α is overexpressed in human cancers as a result of intratumoral hypoxia as well as genetic alterations, such as gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes (for example, ERBB2) and loss-of-function mutations in tumour-suppressor genes (for example, VHL and PTEN). HIF-1α overexpression is associated with treatment failure and increased mortality.
In xenograft assays, manipulation of HIF-1 activity by genetic or pharmacological means has marked effects on tumour growth because of effects on angiogenesis, glucose metabolism and/or cell survival.
Screens are underway to identify small-molecule inhibitors of HIF-1 and to test their efficacy as anticancer agents. These drugs might represent an important component of novel combination therapies that are designed to target signalling molecules in cancer cells.
AbstractHypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates the transcription of genes that are involved in crucial aspects of cancer biology, including angiogenesis, cell survival, glucose metabolism and invasion. Intratumoral hypoxia and genetic alterations can lead to HIF-1α overexpression, which has been associated with increased patient mortality in several cancer types. In preclinical studies, inhibition of HIF-1 activity has marked effects on tumour growth. Efforts are underway to identify inhibitors of HIF-1 and to test their efficacy as anticancer therapeutics.

GlossaryGLYCOLYTIC METABOLISM
Two molecules of ATP and NADH are generated by the conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate. The NADH is then used to reduce pyruvate to lactate.
OXIDATIVE METABOLISM
Glucose is converted to pyruvate, which is transported to the mitochondria, converted to acetyl coenzyme A and oxidized to CO2 in the citric-acid cycle. The NADH and FADH2 generated in this process provide electrons to respiratory cytochromes and, ultimately, to O2 in the inner mitochondrial membrane, generating ATP. The complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose results in the production of 36 molecules of ATP.
SV40 T-ANTIGEN

Sign up for Nature Briefing",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to investigate the role of HIF-1 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.,"Research Hypothesis:
The overexpression of HIF-1α in human cancers, due to intratumoral hypoxia and genetic alterations, is associated with treatment failure and increased mortality. Therefore, targeting HIF-1α may inhibit tumor growth and progression.

Research Proposal:
To investigate the role of HIF-1 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target, we propose to conduct preclinical studies to identify inhibitors of HIF-1 and test their efficacy as anticancer therapeutics. Additionally, efforts will be made to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HIF-1α overexpression in various cancer types and its impact on treatment outcomes. This research will involve in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the effects of manipulating HIF-1 activity on tumor growth, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, screening for small-molecule inhibitors of HIF-1 will be conducted, and their potential as components of novel combination therapies targeting signaling molecules in cancer cells will be explored."

Abstract: In this study, a comparative theoretical and experimental analysis of two immuno-
chromatographic serodiagnostics schemes, which differ in the immobilization of immunoreagents
and the order of the formation of immune complexes, is performed. Based on the theoretical models,
the assays are characterized to determine which scheme has a higher quantity of the detected complex
and thus ensures the sensitivity of the analysis. The results show that for the effective detection of
low-afﬁnity antibodies, the scheme involving the immobilization of the antigen on gold nanoparticles
and the antibody-binding protein on the test strip was more sensitive than the predominantly used
scheme, which inverts the immunoreagents’ locations. The theoretical predictions were conﬁrmed by
the experimental testing of sera collected from tuberculosis patients.
Keywords: lateral ﬂow immunoassay; detection of antibodies; mathematic simulation; tuberculosis
1. Introduction
Immunochemical test systems are widely used in medical and veterinary diagnostics [ 1].
Serodiagnostics is a form of immunoassay used to detect antibodies speciﬁc to the infectious
agent in the blood. These antibodies are generated in response to the presence of an infectious
agent in the body, and detecting them is often more informative than detecting the pathogen [ 2,3].
Immunochromatographic serodiagnostics are conducted using lateral ﬂow test strips, which are also
especially promising for mass use. Testing can be conducted outside the laboratory because it does
not require equipment or highly qualiﬁed personnel. Importantly, the results can be obtained in
10–15 min with this method [ 4–7]. Because of their rapidity, methodological simplicity and low
cost, immunochromatographic assays (ICA) are widely used in medical and veterinary diagnostics.
In addition, the above advantages make serodiagnostic ICA an effective tool for evaluating the results
of immunization of humans and experimental animals.
The traditional scheme for immunochromatographic serodiagnosis (i.e., scheme A) is
shown in Figure 1A. In this scheme, a marker (usually gold nanoparticles) is conjugated
with an immunoglobulin-binding protein (e.g., anti-species antibodies, staphylococcal protein A,
or streptococcal protein G). A sample of blood or serum then ﬂows along the membranes of the test
strip. In the ﬁrst stage, all immunoglobulins in the sample interact with the conjugate. Next, the liquid
reaches the zone of the strip with the immobilized antigen (i.e., the analytic zone). The conjugate
interacts with the antigen molecules, resulting in the formation of a colored complex containing
gold nanoparticles, immunoglobulin-binding protein molecules, immunoglobulins from the sample,
and immobilized antigen. The given scheme is used in the most of lateral ﬂow tests described in the
literature [ 8–12], as well as in the most of the manufactured serodiagnosis tests such as the products
of the companies AmeriTek (Everett, WA, USA; www.ameritek.org), Dr. Fooke Laboratories (Neuss,

Serodiagnostic ICA may be realized in other formats that diff er in the order of detectable 
complex formation and, accordingly, in the composition of the colored complex in the analytic  
zone [13 –16]. The most popular alternate format of serodiagnostic  ICA is a scheme (scheme B) in 
which the antigen molecules are con jugated to gold nanoparticles, and the immunoglobulin -binding 
protein is immobilized on the test strip (Figure 1B). In this ICA, specific immunoglobulins first 
interact with the antigen. The gold nanoparticles conjugate, form complexes, then migrate to the  
analytic zone and bind there. Both kinds of test strips also contain a second control zone with 
immobilized antibodies (anti -species ones in scheme A and antibodies against the antigen for scheme B)  
to control the strips’ functionality.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Reagents
3,30,5,50-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), chloroauric acid, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and sodium
azide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant 38-kDa antigen (Rv0934)
ofMycobacterium tuberculosis was obtained from Arista Biologicals (product code AGMTB-0220,
Allentown, PA, USA), and recombinant staphylococcal protein A was obtained from Imtek (Moscow,
Russia). All salts and other additional reactants were of analytical or reagent grade. The Simplicity
puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for water deionization.
Serum samples from healthy donors were supplied by the State Scientiﬁc Center, Institute of
Immunology (Moscow, Russia). Serum samples from persons with a conﬁrmed case of pulmonary
tuberculosis were supplied by Dr. V . G. Avdienko, Central Tuberculosis Research Institute (Moscow,
Russia). In all the serum samples, the presence of anti-mycobacterial antibodies was conﬁrmed by
quantitative immunoenzyme assay (see below).
2.2. Immunoenzyme Assay of Speciﬁc Antibodies in Serum Samples
Antigen Rv0934 was adsorbed in a 96-well Greiner microplate (100 L per well) for 16 h at 4C
from a 1 g/mL solution in 50 mM Na-carbonate buffer (50 mM, pH 9.6). The wells were washed
with a K-phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), with 0.1 M NaCl and 0.05% detergent Triton X-100 (PBST).
Then, of sera 100-fold diluted with PBST was added (100 L per well) and incubated for 1 h at 37C.
The microplate was washed, and monoclonal antibodies against human IgG labeled with horseradish
peroxidase were added (160 ng/mL, 100 L in PBST) for a 1-h incubation at 37C. After washing,
the activity of the bound peroxidase was tested by the addition of 0.4 mM TMB in an Na-citrate buffer
(100 mM, pH 4.0), with 0.006% H 2O2(100 L per well), incubated for 15 min, and measured for its
OD 450values (optical density at 450 nm).
2.3. Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles
The Frens method [ 18] was used for the synthesis: 0.2 mL of 5% chloroauric acid was added to
97.5 mL of water and heated to boiling. After this, 1.5 mL of 1% sodium citrate was added. The reactants
were boiled for 25 min and then cooled.
Size of the obtained gold nanoparticles was characterized using CX-100 transmission electron
microscope (Jeol, Akishima-shi, Japan) and Image Tool software (University of Texas Health Science
Center, San Antonio, TX, USA) as described in [ 16]. An average diameter of the particles was
283 nm.
2.4. Conjugation of Protein A and Antigen Rv0934 with Gold Nanoparticles
Firstly, the ﬂocculation curves were obtained for mixtures of the mycobacterial antigen Rv0934
and the staphylococcal protein A with gold nanoparticles as described in [ 19]. The protein solutions of
different concentrations were added to gold nanoparticles preparation, 10% NaCl was then added and
OD 590of the mixture was measured after 10-min incubation at room temperature. The plateaus of the
obtained concentration dependences are considered as zones of the saturation of gold nanoparticles
surface by immobilized antibodies. The given saturations were reached for the concentrations equal to
8g/mL for the antigen Rv0934 and 20 g/mL for the protein A, and the given concentrations were
chosen for the conjugation.
The antigen Rv0934 and the protein A were dialyzed against an Na-carbonate buffer (10 mM,
pH 9.0) and diluted to the concentrations indicated above. The pH value of the gold nanoparticle
preparation with OD 520equal to 1.0 was shifted to 9.0 using a 0.1 M K 2CO 3and were then addedSensors 2018 ,18, 36 4 of 15
to the antigen Rv0934 and the protein A solutions. The mixture was then stirred for 10 min, and a
BSA was added to the ﬁnal concentration of 0.25%. Finally, the gold nanoparticles with the bound
proteins were separated by centrifugation (8000 g, 20 min) and redissolved in PBS with 0.25% BSA.
The conjugates were stored at 4C with the addition of sodium azide (0.05%) for long-term storage.
2.5. Application of Reagents onto Immunochromatographic Membranes
All membranes and pads were obtained from Advanced Microdevices, Ambala Cantt, India.
An IsoFlow dispenser (Imagene Technology, Hanover, NH, USA) was used for the reagents application.
In the case of scheme A, the analytic zone was formed by applying the antigen Rv0934 of M.
tuberculosis water solution (1.0 mg/mL) onto the nitrocellulose membrane CNPH90, 2 L of the antigen
solution per 1 cm. The conjugate of protein A and gold nanoparticles was applied to the conjugate
release pad PT-R5 at a dilution corresponding to OD 520= 10.0 in a volume of 11 L per 1 cm.
In the case of scheme B, the analytic zone was formed by applying the protein A onto the
nitrocellulose membrane CNPH90, 2 L of its solution (10 mg/mL in K-phosphate buffer (50 mM,
pH 7.4)) was applied per 1 cm. The conjugate of antigen Rv0934 and gold nanoparticles was applied
to the conjugate release pad PT-R5 at a dilution corresponding to OD 520= 2.0 in a volume of 8 L
per 1 cm.
2.6. Preparation of Immunochromatographic Test Strips
The membranes with the applied reagents were air dried for one day. The test strips were prepared
using the nitrocellulose membrane, conjugate release pad, a sample pad FR1(0.6), and a ﬁnal adsorbent
pad, AP045 as proposed in [ 17]. The multimembrane composite was assembled and then cut using an
Index Cutter-1 automated guillotine cutter (A-Point Technologies, Gibbstown, NJ, USA) into strips
3.5 mm wide. The strips were packed in laminated aluminum foil bags using a FR-900 conveyor
(Dingli Packing Machinery, Wenzhou, China) with added silica gel as the desiccant. The preparation of
the test strips was carried out in a room with relative humidity <30%. The manufactured strips were
stored at room temperature.
2.7. Immunochromatographic Serodiagnostic Assay
One drop of serum to be tested and three drops of PBS containing 1% Tween-20 were added in
an Eppendorf tube. Then, a strip was vertically placed in the tube for 10 min. The obtained results
were inspected visually and/or quantiﬁed using a Reﬂekom portable photometric analyzer (Synteco,
Moscow, Russia).

The following simplifications were used to construct the model for the B scheme:

2.  Two stages of the analysis were considered: in Stage 1, the conjugate of antigen and gold

The signal in ICA was proportional to the concentration of the APR complex. Therefore, the main
modeling task was to ﬁnd the kinetic dependence of the changes in the APR . The distribution of
theAPR complex in the volume of the analytic zone could be nonuniform. Therefore, for accuracy,
the concentration of the complex on the left (Figure 2) boundary of the analytic zone was calculated.
To calculate the kinetic dependence of APR , it was necessary to derive the equations for changes in AP,
R, and AR.

Research Proposal: To investigate the hypothesis, an experimental study will be conducted to compare the sensitivity of the traditional scheme (scheme A) and the alternate scheme (scheme B) for detecting low-affinity antibodies. The study will involve simulating the processes of immune interactions in both schemes, comparing their characteristics, and confirming the potential of scheme B to increase sensitivity through experimental testing using the serodiagnosis of infectious diseases. Additionally, mathematical modeling will be used to analyze the advantages of each analytical scheme and justify the potential of scheme B to increase sensitivity."

Cancer cells deviate from normal body cells in two immu-
nologically important ways. First, tumour cells carry tensto hundreds of protein-changing mutations that are either
responsible for cellular transformation or that have accu-
mulated as mere passengers. Second, as a consequence ofgenetic and epigenetic alterations, tumour cells express aseries of proteins that are normally not present or presentat lower levels. These changes lead to the presentation ofan altered repertoire of MHC class I-associated peptides.
Importantly, while there is now strong clinical evidence
that cytotoxic T-cell activity against such tumour-asso-ciated antigens can lead to cancer regression, at presentwe fail to understand which tumour-associated antigensform the prime targets in effective immunotherapies. Here,
we describe how recent developments in cancer genomics
will make it feasible to establish the repertoire of tumour-associated epitopes on a patient-speciﬁc basis. The elucida-tion of this ‘cancer antigenome’ will be valuable to revealhow clinically successful immunotherapies mediate theireffect. Furthermore, the description of the cancer antige-
nome should form the basis of novel forms of personalized
cancer immunotherapy.The EMBO Journal (2013) 32,194–203. doi:10.1038/

Introduction
It has long been known that T cells have the capacity to
eliminate human cancer cells, as shown by the anti-leukae-
mic effects of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplan-tation and donor lymphocyte infusions (Barnes et al, 1956;
Sprangers et al , 2007). In this setting, the presence of
polymorphic antigens on the surface of tumour cells that
are foreign to the infused T cells forms the basis of tumour
recognition. However, in recent years, it has become apparentthat also autologous T cells can—at least in some cases—show profound anti-tumour reactivity in cancer patients.
In particular in melanoma, the clinical activity of tumour-
reactive T cells has now been documented in a large number
of clinical trials. Speciﬁcally, treatment of patients with theantibody ipilimumab, which interferes with the function ofthe T-cell inhibitory receptor CTLA4, has been shown toresult in a signiﬁcant effect on patient survival (Hodi et al,
2010). More recently, treatment of patients with antibodies
that block signalling through PD-1, a second inhibitoryreceptor on T cells, has also shown considerable clinicalpromise (Brahmer et al, 2012; Topalian et al, 2012). As an
alternative to these antibody-based strategies, regression ofeven large tumour masses has been observed upon the
adoptive transfer of autologous, ex vivo expanded, tumour-
inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TILs) obtained from metastaticmelanoma lesions. Objective response rates for anti-CTLA4therapy and TIL treatment are B10–15% in randomized
phase III studies and B50% in multiple non-randomized
phase I–II studies, respectively, and both treatments can
induce complete tumour regressions in a subset of treatedpatients (Rosenberg et al, 2008; Hodi et al, 2010; Robert et al,
2011). These clinical data provide clear evidence that humantumour cells can express antigenic determinants—epitopes—
that can be the target of autologous Tcells, and that enhance-
ment of such reactivity can lead to cancer regression.Importantly, in the majority of patients responding to theseimmunotherapeutic strategies, we do not know which anti-gens are the target(s) in the observed tumour regression.Such knowledge would be of obvious value, as it could allow
one to steer reactivity towards antigens of interest.
Within this review, we will distinguish two main classes of
tumour-speciﬁc antigens that together make up the cancerantigenome, the class of ‘neo-antigens’ and the class of non-mutated ‘self-antigens’ (Figure 1). The presentation of neo-
antigens by tumour cells is a direct consequence of the large
number of somatic mutations that are found in humantumours. Such neo-antigens may be newly displayed at thesurface of tumour cells because a mutation increases theefﬁciency with which a peptide is presented by MHC mole-cules, for instance by increasing its binding afﬁnity.
Alternatively, generation of neo-antigens that can be recog-
nized by T cells may occur when a mutation alters the T-cellreceptor (TCR)-exposed area of a peptide that is alsopresented by MHC molecules in its non-mutated form.
Presentation of the second class of tumour-associated
epitopes, the non-mutated ‘self-antigens’, involves the dis-
play of epitopes from gene products that are normally onlyexpressed in a restricted set of cell types. Thus, rather thanbeing a direct consequence of mutations, presentation of self-antigens is a consequence of the tissue-speciﬁc or transfor-
mation-induced gene expression proﬁle of tumour cells.
An important distinction between these two classes of
antigens is that T-cell reactivity against self-antigens can

incomplete, and there is strong data to suggest that for at leastpart of the tumour-associated self-antigens, the T-cell reper-
toire available for tumour recognition is of a lower avidity. In
contrast, as neo-antigens are fully tumour speciﬁc, centralT-cell tolerance does not form a concern. By the same token,T-cell responses against neo-antigens are not expected toresult in autoimmune toxicity against healthy tissues, makingimmunotherapeutic manipulation highly attractive from a
theoretical point of view (Figure 1).
In spite of the signiﬁcant appeal of neo-antigen-speciﬁc
T-cell reactivity, our current understanding of tumour-speciﬁcT-cell immunity is in large part restricted to the class of non-mutated self-antigens. This strong bias is a consequence of
the fact that the majority of the mutations in human tumours
that could lead to neo-antigens are unique to that tumour (seebelow). Thus, contrary to the non-mutated self-antigens thatare to a substantial extent shared between patients, most neo-antigens are patient speciﬁc (Figure 1). Importantly, withrecent advances in cancer genomics and immunomonitoring,
the analysis of the full repertoire of tumour-associated anti-
gens on a patient-speciﬁc basis has now become a realisticgoal.
Current knowledge of the repertoire of
human tumour antigens
Our ﬁrst understanding of the molecular determinants on
tumour cells that can be recognized by human Tcells came in
1991 when Boon and co-workers isolated the MAGE-1 antigen
via cDNA expression cloning, using recognition by tumour-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from a melanomapatient as a readout system (van der Bruggen et al, 1991).
In the following decades, a large number of self-antigens that
are aberrantly expressed in human tumours has beendiscovered, either using tumour-reactive CTL or using
patient sera (serological expression cloning, SEREX) as areadout system. In addition, a large set of tumour-
associated epitopes has been identiﬁed by analysing which
peptides from candidate tumour antigens (i.e., proteins thatare highly/aberrantly expressed in tumours) could lead to theinduction of a tumour-reactive T-cell response, an approachtermed as ‘reverse immunology’ (Kawakami et al, 2004).
The self-antigens that have been discovered—
predominantly in melanoma—by these different approaches
can be divided into several subclasses: A ﬁrst class representsepitopes for which expression is normally largely restricted tomale germline cells. These cancer-germline (C/G) antigensare frequently overexpressed in tumours due to demethyla-
tion events, as has been shown for the prototypic MAGE
antigens (A, B and C) (Chomez et al, 2001). A second class of
self-antigens consists of the tissue differentiation antigens,antigens that are shared by tumour cells and the tissue itoriginated from. A well-known example of this class is theMelan-A/MART-1 antigen that is expressed in melanoma but
also in healthy melanocytes (Coulie et al, 1994; Kawakami
et al, 1994). A third class of epitopes is derived from proteins
that are overexpressed in tumours, but that are also expressedin healthy tissues, such as the Her-2/Neu and PRAMEantigens (Fisk et al, 1995; Kessler et al, 2001).
While we now know the identity of a large number of non-
mutated self-antigens that are expressed in human cancer(e.g., for HLA-A2, some 150 epitopes from non-mutated self-antigens have been identiﬁed; (Andersen et al, 2012b), it is
not immediately clear whether recognition of these antigens
is associated with cancer regression, and arguments can be
made both in favour and against their importance.Speciﬁcally, a large series of clinical trials has evaluatedwhether induction of T-cell responses against non-mutatedself-antigens was associated with clinical efﬁcacy. Whileoccasional clinical responses have been observed in these
trials, clinical response rates have on general been
disappointingly low (around 3–5%, reviewed in Rosenberget al, 2004 and Boon et al, 2006), in some cases even when
high numbers of circulating peptide-reactive T cells could beobtained (Rosenberg et al, 2005). In more recent years, the
potential of targeting non-mutated self-antigens has also been
evaluated in clinical studies in which Tcells were infused thathad been genetically engineered to express a tumour-reactiveTCR. In trials that utilized TCRs speciﬁc for the melanocytedifferentiation antigens MART-1 and gp100, a modest clinicalefﬁcacy was observed (response rates of B15–20%; Morgan
et al, 2006; Johnson et al, 2009) and T-cell infusion was
accompanied by signiﬁcant toxicity due to recognition ofhealthy tissues expressing the same antigen. Moreencouraging, in a trial in which a TCR speciﬁc for the NY-ESO-1 C/G antigen was used in patients with metastatic
melanoma and synovial sarcoma, clinical response rates
were higher ( B50%), although these responses were not
always durable (Robbins et al, 2011).
Based on these data, but also based on recent analyses of
T-cell reactivity in patients that received ipilimumab or TIL
therapy (see below), it seems possible that a signiﬁcant part
of the clinically relevant T-cell activity in human cancers doesnot involve recognition of self-antigens, but could involverecognition of patient-speciﬁc neo-antigens. A small numberof studies have aimed to address the potential importance of

for antigens recognized by different T-cell cultures from asingle melanoma patient. This analysis led to the identiﬁca-tion of a series of neo-antigens, and T-cell reactivity againstthese neo-antigens dominated the tumour-speciﬁc T-cell re-
sponse in this patient (Lennerz et al, 2005). Based on these
early studies, it is clear that recognition of human neo-antigens can occur in patients, even in the absence ofimmunotherapy. However, data have been lacking to revealwhether such responses are enhanced by therapies. Likewise,
whether such responses are a crucial component of
therapeutic efﬁcacy or can be selectively enhanced has notbeen established.
The cancer genome
The development of second-generation sequencing technol-ogy has made it feasible to describe the full mutation load(i.e., the ‘genetic landscape’) of human tumours (Meyerson
et al, 2010; Zhao and Grant, 2011). Speciﬁcally, comparison of
the genome sequence of cancer tissue to that of non-transformed tissue from the same patient has been used toreveal the full range of genomic alterations within a tumour—including nucleotide substitutions, structural rearrangementsand copy number alterations (Meyerson et al, 2010). In early
studies that described cancer genomes, analysis was still
restricted to subsets of the genome (e.g., all kinase genes;the kinome), because of high costs and limited sequencingcapacity. However, with technology advancing and costsdropping, analysis of the entire protein-encoding part of the
genome (the exome) or the entire cancer genome has become
feasible and will soon become routine.
Exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing each
have their speciﬁc advantages and disadvantages in thedetection of mutations that could potentially be relevant forthe immune system. Exome sequencing (which covers only
theB1% coding region of the genome) has the clear advan-
tage that it can provide a higher sequence coverage andconsequently a higher ability to detect mutations, includingmutations that are only expressed by part of the tumour cells.As a downside, this method is still somewhat limited by our
knowledge of the protein-coding parts of the genome and by
uneven capture efﬁciency across exons and, as a conse-quence, some mutations may be missed. In one study, ahepatocellular cancer was analysed by both whole genomeand exome sequencing. The results obtained showed that a
signiﬁcant fraction (25 of the 63) of the mutations that were
identiﬁed by whole genome sequencing could not be detectedby exome sequencing, with the missed mutations primarilybeing present in areas with low coverage (Totoki et al, 2011).
On the other hand, data from the Sanger Institute havedemonstrated that of a set of mutations that had previously
been identiﬁed in cell lines by conventional sequence
analysis, the vast majority (313 out of 326 mutations, 97%)was also identiﬁed by whole exome sequencing (S Behjatiand M Stratton, personal communication).
As a third alternative to whole genome and exome sequen-
cing, tumour-speciﬁc mutations within the set of expressedgenes (the transcriptome) may be identiﬁed by RNA sequen-
cing. This approach has the advantage over exome sequen-cing that it is not limited to known genes, and thereby has the
potential to also detect novel transcripts, for instance formed
by intragenic fusions or, in case of pathogen-induced cancers,non-human genes. As a downside, it is difﬁcult to identify amatched control, as mRNA expression proﬁles of tumour andnormal tissue will not be identical, and this makes it challen-ging to distinguish tumour-speciﬁc mutations from poly-
morphisms. As a second concern, the ability to reliably call
mutations within RNA species that are only present ata low level, either because of low level gene expressionor because of low mRNA stability (for instance due tonon-sense-mediated RNA decay) will be limited.
Mutation rates and patterns in human cancers
Within a period of only a few years, second-generationsequencing has allowed a description of the genomic changes
within thousands of human cancer exomes and genomes
(Stratton, 2011; (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic). The genome changes encountered include single-base substitutions, small insertions and deletions (togetherreferred to as indels), copy number changes, DNA
rearrangements, but also structural variants at the level of
the chromosome (e.g., ampliﬁcations, deletions and fusion/translocation events). Single-base substitutions (single-nucleotide variants, SNVs) comprise the vast majority ofmutations that are encountered in human cancers andrange in number from B1000 to 100 000 in the entire
genome (Stratton, 2011). However, the number of mutations
that is relevant to immune recognition—mutations that leadto the production of a protein sequence that is absent in thegermline—is much smaller. This type of mutations includesindels that alter the open reading frame of proteins, intragenic
fusions that lead to the production of a fusion sequence,
splice site mutations and, in particular, non-synonymousSNVs within exons.
Interestingly, sequencing studies have revealed a substan-
tial variability between the number of non-synonymouschanges between different tumour types (Greenman et al,
2007; Stratton, 2011). For instance, the description of the ﬁrst
cancer genome sequence in 2008 revealed a total of 10 non-synonymous mutations in the coding regions of an acutemyeloid leukaemia (Ley et al , 2008). Somewhat higher
numbers of non-synonymous mutations within exonic
regions have been reported for a basal-like breast cancer
(28, n¼1) (Ding et al , 2010), glioblastoma multiforme
(average of 36, n¼21) (Parsons et al, 2008), pancreatic
tumours (average of 48, n¼24) (Jones et al , 2008b),
hepatocellular cancer (63, n¼1) (Totoki et al, 2011), and
colon and breast tumours (average of 76 and 84, respectively,
n¼11 each) (Sjoblom et al , 2006; Wood et al , 2007).
Furthermore, very high mutation rates have been observedin cancers with substantial exogenous mutagenic exposures,such as ultraviolet light in the case of melanoma (187 non-synonymous mutations in a case report and an average of 201
mutations in 14 tumours) (Pleasance et al, 2010a; Wei et al,
2011), or exposure to tobacco smoke carcinogens in lungcancers (94 non-synonymous mutations in a lung cancer cellline and 4300 mutations in one primary tumour) (Lee et al,
2010; Pleasance et al, 2010b). Finally, as expected, tumours
with mismatch repair deﬁciencies also carry large numbers ofThe cancer antigenome
B Heemskerk et al
196 The EMBO Journal VOL 32 |NO 2 |2013 &2013 European Molecular Biology Organizationmutations (Greenman et al, 2007). As an example, whereas
microsatellite stable (MSS) colon cancers carried on averageB100 mutations, the number of mutations in two
microsatellite instable (MSI) colon cancers was 532 and 915
(Timmermann et al, 2010).
The above data provide ballpark ﬁgures on the number of
mutations that are present in a high proportion of the cellswithin different types of human tumours at a given point intime. However, tumour cells continue to accumulate muta-
tions throughout the stages of tumour progression.
Furthermore, metastasis can involve the distal outgrowth oftumour cells that were derived from a subclone that wassmall within the primary tumour. Because of this potential forgenetic heterogeneity, it is important to also understand the
degree of kinship between different areas within the same
tumour, and between different metastatic lesions within apatient.
Heterogeneity within primary tumours and between
tumour metastasesComparative sequence analysis of multiple intrapatient le-sions has now been performed for a number of humantumour types. In a study by Jones et al (2008 a,b), it was
evaluated to what extent mutations found in an index meta-
static lesion were also present in the matched primarytumours and at other metastatic sites within the same patient.Sanger sequencing revealed that only a minor fraction(around 3%) of the mutations that were identiﬁed withinthe index lesions were not present in the primary tumour or
other metastases (Jones et al, 2008a). More recently, whole
genome sequencing has been employed to compare themutation proﬁle of a primary basal-like breast cancer and abrain metastasis (Ding et al, 2010). In these tumours, a total
of 50 mutations (including SNV and indels) were found, of
which 48 were shared between the two. Furthermore, similar
results were obtained in a hepatocellular cancer, in which 205out of 214 mutations (96%) were present in both the primarytumour and two metastases (Tao et al, 2011).
In contrast to these data that show a high degree of kinship
between different tumour sites, one report documented that
19 out of 32 mutations within a metastasized lobular breast
cancer were not present in the primary tumour that wasresected 9 years earlier, prior to radiotherapy. Furthermore, ofthe 11 mutations that were shared, only 5 were abundantwith the primary tumour, whereas the remainder had a very
low allele frequency, in between 1 and 13% (Shah et al,
2009). Likewise, a substantial fraction (around 35%) ofmutations observed in different metastatic lesions ofpatients with pancreatic cancer was not shared betweenindividual metastases (Yachida et al, 2010). Finally, a recent
study that analysed heterogeneity between different
metastases and also between different regions of theprimary tumour in patients with renal cell carcinomademonstrated that, in these cases, the fraction of mutationsthat were detected in only some of the lesions was very high(B65%). Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity was even
observed within the primary tumour mass. Thus, for a
randomly identiﬁed mutation, the likelihood that thismutation would be present at all tumour sites within thesepatients was only one in three (Gerlinger et al, 2012).
Collectively, these data show a striking degree of variability
between patients with respect to the genetic kinship betweenprimary and metastasized tumours, with in some cases
different lesions being nearly identical, whereas in othercases the majority of mutations being private. It seems
plausible that kinship between different tumour sites will in
part differ in a systematic way between tumour types, forinstance depending on whether metastasis is likely to occurearly or late in the disease process. In addition, disparitybetween different lesions is likely to be inﬂuenced by therapy,both by the direct DNA damaging effect of for instance
radiation therapy or alkylating agents, but also by the genetic
bottleneck that an efﬁcient therapy will form. Finally, thekinship between different lesions will in part be governed bychance; whether the cell that forms a given metastasishappens to derive from a dominant or minor clone within
the primary tumour. More data will be required to understand
which of the above factors is most dominant. However, evenwith the limited data currently available, it is already appar-ent that genetic heterogeneity with human tumours will be animportant factor to take into account when targeting tumour-speciﬁc neo-antigens.
Driver and passenger mutations
Classically, the mutations that are found in cancer cells aredivided into two categories, ‘Drivers’ and ‘Passengers’,
according to their role in cancer development. Driver muta-
tions are those mutations that confer a selective advantage tothe cells that carry them, and these include inactivatingmutations in tumour suppressor genes and activating muta-tions in oncogenes. All other mutations, which are neutral
with respect to cell division or death, are considered as
‘passengers’. Such passengers were either already present inthe ancestor cancer cell at the moment it acquired one of itsdriver mutations, or were acquired (by a subclone of tumourcells) during subsequent tumour growth (Stratton et al ,
2009).
The number of human genes for which a role in tumour
development has been shown or is suspected is substantial.To date, B400 (2%) of the B22 000 protein-coding genes
have been reported to have recurrent mutations in humancancer and are therefore likely to confer a selective advantage
(Lee et al, 2010; Stratton, 2011).
Furthermore, as many of these driver mutations only occur
in a low fraction of tumours (Wood et al , 2007), our
knowledge of recurring—and hence presumed to bedriver—mutations in human cancer is likely to still beincomplete. Nevertheless, even though the number of driver
mutations that can occur in human tumours is substantial, it
is important to realize that most of the mutations that arefound in a given tumour are likely to be passengers that areneutral to tumour growth (estimated at 85% in a study byWood et al, 2007). This implies that most of the potential
T-cell reactivity towards neo-antigens will be directed against
mutated gene products that are dispensable for tumourgrowth. The consequence of T-cell targeting of drivers andpassengers is described below. In addition, we will introducea third class of mutations, called ‘essential passengers’ .
From cancer genomes to cancer
antigenomes
The mutational landscapes described above indicate that
there is a clear opportunity for the immune system toThe cancer antigenome
B Heemskerk et al
197 &2013 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 32 |NO 2 |2013distinguish tumour cells from healthy tissue. How can geno-
mic information on human cancers be utilized to understandwhich mutations may result in T-cell recognition? As dis-
cussed above, only those mutations that result in the expres-
sion of a non-germline protein sequence can lead to theformation of neo-antigens. As for most tumours the bulk ofsuch mutations are formed by non-synonymous SNV we willhere focus on this category of mutations, but the sameanalysis pipeline applies to for instance indels or gene fusions
that alter germline protein sequences.
The majority of MHC class I binding peptides is nine amino
acids long. Thus, when we for now ignore the contribution oflonger peptides, nine neo-peptides can be formed for eachnon-synonymous SNV, in which the mutated residue is pre-
sent at either one of the positions within the peptide.
However, of those neo-peptides, only a small fraction(roughly a few %) will bind with high afﬁnity to a givenHLA allele. Importantly, through seminal work ofRammensee and colleagues in the early nineties (Falk et al,
1991) and work by many groups since then, we have
obtained a very detailed understanding of the ligand
preference of human MHC class I alleles. Therefore, withthe repertoire of protein-changing mutations in a cancergenome identiﬁed, it is straightforward to predict withreasonable accuracy which encoded peptides are likely to
bind to the MHC class I alleles expressed by that patient,
using algorithms such as NetMHC (Buus et al, 2003).
As an example of such an in silico epitope prediction, Segal
et al (2008) have analysed the potential for neo-antigen
formation using a set of 1152 mutations that were found in
11 colon and 11 breast cancers. The results obtained showed
that, on average, 7–10 mutated peptides were predicted asligands for the human MHC class I alleles (HLA-A0201) forthese 2 tumour types. Extrapolation of these data to the 6different HLA class I alleles (-A, -B and -C, 2 each) that can beexpressed results in a total number of B40 toB60 potential
targets for T-cell recognition per tumour. However, a number
of factors that will determine which of these predicted MHCligands can actually be seen by T cells should be taken intoaccount.
(i) Mutations in genes that are not expressed within a given
tumour is a non-event from an immunological point of view.
Thus, the number of mutations that can be expected to be ofimmunological interest can be obtained by correcting for thefraction of genes expressed in the average tumour, andperhaps even somewhat more, as DNA repair is more efﬁ-cient for transcribed genes. (ii) While binding of mutated
peptides to MHC molecules is probably the most signiﬁcant
bottleneck in epitope presentation, it is not the only one.Speciﬁcally, the protein that contains the mutated residueneeds to be processed—primarily by the proteasome—suchthat the peptide that has the potential to bind to MHC class I
molecules is actually produced. Furthermore, this peptide
then has to be transported into the ER lumen by the TAP1/TAP2 transporter to allow assembly with MHC class I,providing another—albeit minor—bottleneck. (iii) Even if agiven mutated peptide is presented by MHC class I at the cell
surface, this does not guarantee T-cell recognition.
Speciﬁcally, T-cell recognition can only occur when TCRsthat have the ability to recognize the mutant epitope butnot the parental peptide exist within the T-cell repertoire.While prior data indicate that the immune system has a highability to distinguish even minor variations in MHC-bound
peptides, certain types of mutation, such as alterations at theN-terminal peptide residue or conservative substitutions at
other positions can be missed (Kessels et al, 2004).
Because of the above factors, the number of mutated
epitopes that will actually be presented at the cell surfaceof tumour cells and can also be recognized by Tcells will besubstantially lower than the 40–60 predicted MHC ligands,perhaps by an order of magnitude. Thus, the number of neo-
epitopes that can be recognized by T cells may be a handful
for tumours such as breast and colorectal cancer, andtumours with a lower mutation load such as medulloblas-toma (Parsons et al, 2011) may often lack such determinants
entirely. Vice versa, tumours that generally have a high
mutation load, such as melanoma, smoking-associated
lung cancer or MSI colon cancers (Lee et al ,2 0 1 0 ;
Timmermann et al,2 0 1 0 ;W e i et al,2 0 1 1 )c a nb ee x p e c t e d
to present an array of neo-antigens to which T cells couldreact.
Is there clinical data that would suggest a correlation
between tumour mutation load and immunogenicity?
Melanoma has long been known to be a relatively ‘immu-nogenic’ tumour, with occasional spontaneous regressions,and with strong evidence for clinical activity of tumour-speciﬁc T cells. Likewise, MSI colon cancers—which have a
high mutation load due to DNA repair deﬁciencies—have
been shown to have a better prognosis and an increasedCD8
þT-cell inﬁltrate relative to MSS tumours (Dolcetti et al,
1999). Thus, even though the evidence is highly indirect,these data provide some indication for a causal relationship
between mutation load and T-cell recognition. Because of
the possible correlation between mutation load and T-cellrecognition, analyses of T-cell reactivity against human neo-antigens may in ﬁrst instance perhaps best focused ontumours such as melanoma and smoking-associated lungcancer.
While cancer genome information has not yet been uti-
lized to analyse autologous T-cell reactivity in humans,proof-of-principle for the ability to identify tumour-speciﬁcneo-antigens by cancer genome-based approaches has beenobtained in mouse models in two recent studies. In work by
Sahin and colleagues, whole exome sequencing of the B16
melanoma cell line—the most widely used melanoma modelin mice for many years—revealed the presence of around 500non-synonymous mutations, a number that is within therange that is found within human melanoma. Importantly,when 50 of these mutations were analysed in more detail, 3
of these could be shown to encode endogenously processed
immunogenic epitopes. Furthermore, when for two of thesethree epitopes the potential value of vaccination was tested,inhibition of tumour growth could be demonstrated for bothof these (Castle et al , 2012). In work by Schreiber and
colleagues, exome sequencing was used to identify a
dominant neo-antigen in a mouse tumour cell line, and thisknowledge was subsequently exploited to demonstrate thatimmune pressure could lead to epitope loss (see below)(Matsushita et al , 2012). Based on the successful
identiﬁcation of novel neo-antigens in the still only
partially characterized sets of mutations in these tworecent studies, it seems plausible that whole genome/exome-based analyses of human tumours will likewise beinformative.The cancer antigenome
B Heemskerk et al
198 The EMBO Journal VOL 32 |NO 2 |2013 &2013 European Molecular Biology OrganizationAnalysis of T-cell reactivity against the
cancer antigenome
The above sections describe the number of potential neo-
antigens that is present in different tumour genomes and howsuch neo-epitopes can be predicted with relative ease. In
addition, RNAseq data obtained on tumour material can in
parallel be used to determine which of the non-mutated self-antigens (e.g., cancer-germline antigens) are expressed with-in an individual tumour, thereby making it possible toexamine the potential role of both classes of antigens.An important question is how this knowledge can subse-
quently be used to evaluate spontaneous or therapy-induced
autologous T-cell reactivity against such antigens. As such ananalysis would involve very large numbers of potentialepitopes (dozens of potential neo-antigens for tumours suchas breast and colorectal cancer, hundreds for tumours such as
melanoma), such analyses should be able to measure T-cell
responses against large collections of antigens in limitedamounts of clinical material. Furthermore, as tumour-speciﬁcT-cell responses are often of a very low magnitude, thesensitivity of such analyses should be high.
The detection of antigen-speciﬁc Tcells independent of their
functional capacities ﬁrst became possible when Altman et al
(1996) demonstrated that ﬂuorescently labelled multimers ofMHC molecules containing a peptide of interest could be usedto speciﬁcally detect T cells that recognize this epitope. ThisMHC multimer technology has become a widely used
technology for immunological monitoring, and has been
used to detect even low frequencies of antigen-speciﬁcT cells in patient samples. While the original technology forproduction of MHC multimers did not allow the generation ofthe large sets of MHC multimers that are required for
personalized immunomonitoring, this issue has been
overcome by the development of a ‘peptide exchangetechnology’ . In this strategy, large quantities of MHCcomplexes are refolded in the presence of a conditionalpeptide ligand that cleaves itself upon UV light exposure.This allows one to produce collections of hundreds or
thousands of different peptide–MHC complexes for T-cell
staining in a straightforward manner (Rodenko et al, 2006;
Toebes et al, 2006). This peptide exchange technology has
been developed for most of the common HLA A and B alleles(Toebes et al, 2006; Bakker et al, 2008; Brackenridge et al,
2011). Furthermore, the group of G Grotenbreg has also
developed this technology for a series of HLA-C alleles(G Grotenbreg, personal communication).
UV-induced peptide exchange allows one to produce the
large collections of peptide–MHC complexes required toevaluate T-cell reactivity against potential neo-antigens.
However, the amount of clinical material that can be obtained
is generally insufﬁcient to measure T-cell reactivity against allthese potential antigens when analysed by conventional MHCmultimer ﬂow cytometry (e.g., to analyse T-cell reactivityagainst 100 potential antigens, some 500 ml of peripheral
blood would be required). To address this second issue, we
have developed a strategy, termed as ‘combinatorial coding’,in which each peptide–HLA complex is conjugated to aunique two (or multi-) colour code. As a consequence, eachindividual ﬂuorochrome can be used in many colour combi-
nations, and antigen-speciﬁc T cells are identiﬁed by the
colour code that they carry. We have developed this strategyfor the use of 8 different ﬂuorochromes, thereby allowing one
to visualize 28 different T-cell populations in a single sample(Hadrup et al, 2009; Andersen et al, 2012a). In parallel to this,
Davis and colleagues have developed a similar combinatorial
staining approach using a smaller number of colours (Newellet al , 2009). As an alternative to the large-scale MHC
multimer-based screens made possible by thesetechnologies, it should also be possible to evaluate T-cellreactivity by functional assays. Advantage of such functional
screens would be that these can be performed independent of
the HLA type of the patient. However, sensitivity of theseassays is often lower and sample availability may in manycases be a limiting factor. A general pipeline that can be usedto describe the patient-speciﬁc cancer antigenome and T-cell
reactivity towards it is outlined in Figure 2.
In a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the potential of
large-scale MHC multimer based analysis of human T-cellreactivity, we recently evaluated antigen recognition of tu-mour-inﬁltrating T cells from melanoma patients, using apanel of all the known shared (i.e., primarily non-mutated)
HLA-A2 antigens (Kvistborg et al, 2012). In this study, most
tumour-derived T-cell populations could be shown to containreactivity against one or multiple epitopes within this set of145 shared antigens. However, in the vast majority of cases,these T-cell responses were of a surprisingly low magnitude
(o0.1%), and on average they made up o1% of the tumour-
resident cytotoxic T-cell population. These data demonstratethat high-throughput analysis of T-cell reactivity in clinicalsamples is feasible. At the same time, the observation that499% of T cells in these samples is not reactive with any of
the shared antigens tested is consistent with the notion that
reactivity against neo-antigens may be prominent in humanT-cell inﬁltrates in melanoma.
How to exploit an understanding of the
cancer antigenome?
The above-described pipeline for analysis of the tumour-
speciﬁc T-cell response on a patient-speciﬁc basis should inthe coming years reveal the balance between T-cell reactivity
against shared and patient-speciﬁc antigens and how such
T-cell reactivity is inﬂuenced by therapy. If reactivity againstneo-antigens can be shown to be prevalent in certain humancancers, then it will be interesting to consider how to exploitthem.
Characteristics of the neo-antigens
An important consideration when aiming to exploit theexpression of neo-antigens to drive T-cell recognition oftumour cells is whether immune pressure is likely to lead
to rapid epitope loss (Figure 3). Induction of T-cell reactivity
against oncogenic mutations within cancer genes at ﬁrstglance appears to be the most attractive with respect to thisissue. However, such mutations only form a relatively smallsubset of all mutations present, reducing the likelihood ofT-cell recognition. In addition, genetic heterogeneity within
tumours may render part of the tumour cells less dependent
on a given oncogenic mutation than may a priori be expected(Gerlinger et al, 2012). A second class of neo-antigens of
interest is formed by mutations within essential genes incases in which the wild-type copy is lost. Cancer cells
frequently lose heterozygosity at large chromosomal areas.The cancer antigenome
B Heemskerk et al
199 &2013 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 32 |NO 2 |2013If a mutation is present within an essential (household) gene
of which the wild-type copy is absent, then T-cell reactivityagainst the neo-epitope can only lead to immune escape bymutation reversal. We suggest to refer to this class ofmutations as ‘essential passengers’ . Coulie and coworkers
have to our knowledge provided the ﬁrst description of such
an essential passenger, by identiﬁcation of a mutant malicenzyme epitope that was recognized by autologous T cells ona tumour that had lost the wild-type copy of this essentialenzyme (Karanikas et al, 2001). The third and ﬁnal class of
mutations is formed by the true passengers, mutations that
are irrelevant for cellular transformation and in gene copies
that the cell does not need to maintain. Selective pressure bythe immune system may well lead to the loss of such mutatedgenes. In line with this, intriguing work by Schreiber andcolleagues in a murine model has demonstrated that loss ofexpression of a passenger mutation can be observed upon
T-cell pressure (Matsushita et al, 2012). At present, it is
unknown whether the T-cell pressure during human cancerdevelopment is sufﬁcient to lead to a similar immuneselection, an important question for future research. Wenote that the comparison of the frequency of neo-epitopes
in human cancers that for instance lack or express a certain
HLA allele could be utilized to answer this question. Withregard to the induction of immune reactivity againstpassenger mutations by immunotherapy, it does seemplausible that this would lead to Darwinian selection ofepitope loss variants. However, the simultaneous targeting
of a handful of passenger mutations may well be enough to
substantially reduce this risk, and we consider it possible thatthe simultaneous targeting of a number of passengers couldturn out to be more effective than the targeting of a singledriver or essential passenger.
Manipulation of T-cell reactivity against neo-antigens
How can the description of the repertoire of tumour-asso-ciated antigens, and in particular neo-antigens, on a patient-
speciﬁc basis be exploited therapeutically? At present two
different strategies can be envisioned. First, one could focuson those neo-antigens for which T-cell reactivity can bedemonstrated within the tumour or peripheral blood of thatpatient. A signiﬁcant advantage of this T cell-centered strat-
egy is that it focuses the immunotherapeutic intervention on

plexed MHC multimer staining, to determine whether T cells
recognizing these neo-antigens are present within the patients’repertoire or whether they can be induced from the naı ¨ve T-cell
repertoire.

200 The EMBO Journal VOL 32 |NO 2 |2013 &2013 European Molecular Biology Organizationthose mutations for which there is evidence that the mutant
peptide is expressed by tumour cells and can be recognizedby T cells. As a downside, if for many neo-antigens that are
present on tumour cells spontaneous T-cell responses do not
occur, such a focus would be unnecessarily restrictive. As analternative strategy, potential neo-antigens could be selectedsolely on the basis of genomic information/RNA expressiondata and subsequent epitope predictions. Such an approachwould include neo-antigens for which spontaneous T-cell
recognition is absent but would likely also include many
mutant sequences that are not presented by HLA, or forwhich a T-cell repertoire is lacking.
The clinical use of such epitopes to induce or enhance
tumour-speciﬁc T-cell reactivity should be considered
as a form of personalized medicine (‘personalized cancer
immunotherapy’), and the regulatory framework to guidethe clinical development of such personalised therapies iscurrently a topic of discussion (C Britten, personal commu-
nication). Perhaps the most straightforward use of such neo-antigens will be their administration as vaccines, for instance
as synthetic peptides or recombinant DNA or RNA vaccines.
The limited data on such an approach in mouse models(Castle et al , 2012; Matsushita et al , 2012) make one
cautiously optimistic; it will now be important to obtainproof-of-principle in humans.
Note added in proof
The ﬁrst evidence that patient-speciﬁc neo-epitopes can beidentiﬁed through the use of cancer exome data has recentlybeen provided (van Rooij et al, 2013).

Abstract
The ClusPro server ( https://cluspro.org ) is a widely used tool for protein-protein docking. The 
server provides a simple home page for basic use, requiring only two files in Protein Data Bank 
format. However, ClusPro also offers a number of advanced options to modify the search that 
include the removal of unstructured protein regions, applying attraction or repulsion, accounting 
for pairwise distance restraints, constructing homo-multimers, considering small angle X-ray 
scattering (SAXS) data, and finding heparin binding sites. Six different energy functions can be 
used depending on the type of proteins. Docking with each energy parameter set results in ten 
models defined by centers of highly populated clusters of low energy docked structures. This 
protocol describes the use of the various options, the construction of auxiliary restraints files, the 
selection of the energy parameters, and the analysis of the results. Although the server is heavily 
used, runs are generally completed in < 4 hours.
INTRODUCTION
Protein-protein interactions are important for understanding cellular function and 
organization. Substantial progress has been made toward generating potential protein-protein 
interaction networks using high-throughput proteomics studies, primarily yeast two-hybrid 
assays1,2 and mass spectrometry3,4. Mechanistic interpretation of the interactions frequently 
requires atom-level details, ideally obtained by X-ray crystallography. However, some of the 
biologically important interactions occur in transient complexes, and hence experimental 
structure determination may be very difficult, even when the structures of the component 
proteins are known. Therefore, computational docking methods have been developed that,

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptstarting from the structures of component proteins, attempt to determine the structure of 
their complexes targeting an accuracy close to that provided by X-ray crystallography5–7. 
Docking usually generates a number of detailed models that define the positions of all 
atoms, but the current scoring functions are usually not accurate enough for reliable model 
discrimination, and in most cases the model closest to the native structure cannot be 
identified solely by computational tools. However, model selection can be based on 
additional information obtained by lower resolution methods such as site-directed 
mutagenesis or chemical cross-linking, and the selected models generated by the docking 
provide atom-level details.
Docking methods can be classified as direct or template-based. Based on thermodynamics, 
direct methods attempt to find the structure of the target complex located at the minimum of 
Gibbs free energy in the conformational space, and thus require a computationally feasible 
free energy evaluation model and an effective minimization algorithm8. As will be 
discussed, direct docking methods may give good results if the conformational changes upon 
protein-protein association are moderate. Template-based docking is based on the 
observation that interacting pairs sharing above 30% sequence identity often interact in the 
same way, and hence the structure of the target complex can be obtained by homology 
modeling tools if an appropriate template complex of known structure is available9. 
Although the applicability of template-based docking has been extended based on the 
observation that partial structures representing the interface region can provide templates10, 
the coverage of the template space at present is still limited and hence direct methods are 
generally more useful in many applications.
This protocol describes ClusPro, a web based server for the direct docking of two interacting 
proteins. ClusPro was introduced in 200411,12 but since then has been substantially modified 
and expanded13–15. The server performs three computational steps as follows: (1) rigid body 
docking by sampling billions of conformations, (2) root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) 
based clustering of the 1000 lowest energy structures generated to find the largest clusters 
that will represent the most likely models of the complex, and (3) refinement of selected 
structures using energy minimization (Figure 1). The rigid body docking step uses PIPER16, 
a docking program based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) correlation approach. The 
FFT approach, introduced by Katchalski-Katzir and co-workers17 in 1992, led to major 
progress in rigid body protein-protein docking. In this method, one of the proteins (which 
we will call the receptor) is placed at the origin of the coordinate system on a fixed grid, the 
second protein (which we will call the ligand) is placed on a movable grid, and the 
interaction energy is written in the form of a correlation function (or as a sum of a few 
correlation functions). The numerical efficiency of the methods stems from the fact that such 
energy functions can be efficiently calculated using Fast Fourier Transforms, and results in 
the ability of exhaustively sampling billions of the conformations of the two interacting 
protein, evaluating the energies at each grid point. Thus, the FFT based algorithm enables 
docking of proteins without any a priori  information on the structure of the complex. 
Katchalski-Katzir et al.17 used a simple scoring function that accounted only for shape 
complementarity. However, subsequent methods based on the FFT correlation approach to 
docking introduced more complex and more accurate scoring functions that also included 
terms representing electrostatic interactions18,19, or both electrostatic and desolvation Kozakov et al. Page 2
Nat Protoc . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcontributions20. A key to the success of rigid body methods is that the shape 
complementarity term allows for some overlaps, and hence the methods are able to tolerate 
moderate differences between bound and unbound (separately crystallized) structures. As 
will be discussed, one of the distinguishing characteristics of PIPER, the docking program 
used in the current version of ClusPro, is that this implementation of the FFT correlation 
method employs a scoring function that includes a structure-based pairwise interaction term, 
and the combination with the other terms in the energy function substantially increases the 
accuracy of docking, resulting in more near-native structures16.
Rigid body methods including PIPER perform exhaustive sampling of the conformational 
space on a dense grid, and hence certainly sample some near-native structures. However, the 
need for tolerating some steric clashes due to docking unbound protein structures requires 
the use of approximate scoring functions, and reducing sensitivity to conformational 
differences also reduces specificity. Therefore, the docked conformations that are close to 
the native structure do not necessarily have the lowest energies, whereas low energy 
conformations may occur far from the X-ray structures. In PIPER we retain the 1000 lowest 
energy docked structures for further processing and hope that this set includes at least some 
that are close to the native structure of the complex. Another unique feature of ClusPro is 
that we select the centers of highly populated clusters of the low energy structures rather 
than simply the lowest energy conformations as predictions of the complex21. As will be 
further discussed, the size of each cluster represents the width of the corresponding energy 
well, and hence provides some information on entropic contributions to the free energy. 
While the largest clusters do not necessarily contain the most near-native structures, we have 
shown12 that the 30 largest clusters include near-native structures for 92% of complexes in a 
protein-protein benchmark set22–25. However, the success rates are higher for certain classes 
of complexes such as enzyme-inhibitor pairs26,27, and hence it is generally sufficient to 
retain only ten or fewer highly populated clusters. Supplementary Table 1 lists some 
performance characteristics of ClusPro 2.0 for the different classes of complexes in 
benchmark 4.0. The characteristics shown are the number of complexes with at least one 
cluster of docked structures within 10 Å interface root mean square deviation (IRMSD) from 
the native complex, the average number of docked structures with less than 10 Å IRMSD 
within the 1000 lowest energy structures, and the average value of the lowest IRMSD 
achieved. Note that to define the IRMSD of a docked structure from the native complex we 
first select the interface residues as the ligand residues that have any atom within 10 Å of 
any receptor atom. Then we superimpose the receptors in the two structures, and calculate 
the Cα RMSD for the selected interface residues. According to Supplementary Table 1, a 
large fraction of enzyme-inhibitor pairs are in the “easy” category, and in almost all cases we 
have a cluster with its center within 10 Å IRMSD, with the average IRMSD of 2.94 Å. In 
contrast, for the “other” type complexes such clusters are found only in about 50% of cases, 
and the average IRMSD is 7.54 Å even in the easy category. The success rate is similar for 
antibody-antigen pairs if both proteins are independently crystallized. However, as will be 
discussed, the performance is improved if the non-CDR regions of the antibody are masked 
and hence cannot be in the interface.
The current version, ClusPro 2.0, is heavily used; by June 2016 it had over 17,000 users 
(among them over 7,000 registered, which is not required), and completed over 172,000 Kozakov et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptdocking calculations, currently adding about 3,000 per month. Models built by the server 
have been reported in over 400 publications. Later in this protocol we describe the types of 
the applications that frequently occur in these papers.
The PIPER docking algorithm
As stated, the ClusPro server is based on PIPER, which performs the sampling. The center 
of mass of the receptor is fixed at the origin of the coordinate system, and the possible 
rotational and translational positions of the ligand are evaluated at the given level of 
discretization. The rotational space is sampled on a sphere-based grid that defines a 
subdivision of a spherical surface in which each pixel covers the same surface area as every 
other pixel28. The 70,000 rotations we consider correspond to about 5 degrees in terms of 
the Euler angles. The step size of the translational grid is 1 Å. It is easy to see that for an 
average size protein this amounts to sampling 109–1010 conformations.
PIPER represents the interaction energy between two proteins using an expression of the 
form E = w 1Erep + w2Eattr + w 3Eelec + w 4EDARS , where Erep and Eattr denote the repulsive 
and attractive contributions to the van der Waals interaction energy, and Eelec is an 
electrostatic energy term. EDARS  is a pairwise structure-based potential constructed by the 
Decoys as the Reference State (DARS)29 approach, and it primarily represents desolvation 
contributions, i.e., the free energy change due to the removal of the water molecules from 
the interface16. The coefficients w1, w2, w3, and w4 define the weights of the corresponding 
terms, and are optimally selected for different types of docking problems. Unless specified 
otherwise in Advanced Options, the server generates four sets of models using the scoring 
schemes called (1) balanced, (2) electrostatic-favored, (3) hydrophobic-favored, and (4) van 
der Waals + electrostatics (see Table 1). As will be described, for complexes that do not fit 
into these categories and are classified as “others” in the protein-protein docking 
benchmarks22–25, ClusPro generates structures using three different coefficient sets (Table 
1). To understand the magnitude of these coefficients we note that Erep and Eattr, while 
defined on the grid, are scaled to the van der Waals energy16, and hence w1 < 1.0 and w2 
<1.0 yield “softening” of both repulsive and attractive van der Waals terms. Such softening 
is necessary, since the bound and unbound conformations of the proteins to be docked 
generally differ, in some cases substantially. The DARS potential has been parameterized on 
a set of complexes that included a large number of enzyme-inhibitor pairs and multi-subunit 
proteins, and hence the resulting potential assumes good shape and electrostatic 
complementarity29. Since EDARS  is scaled to the magnitudes of protein-protein binding free 
energies, w4 =1.0 is the “neutral” choice. Eelec is represented by a truncated and smoothed 
Coulomb expression, also defined on the grid16. Since the charges are given as multiples of 
the electronic charge and the interatomic distance is measured in Å, obtaining the 
electrostatic interaction energy in kcal/mol using the Coulomb expression and these units30 
would require the coefficient w3 =332. However, the truncation and smoothing reduce the 
magnitude of Eelec relative to the value based on the Coulomb expression, and hence we use 
w3=600 in the balanced option of the parameter set. This set was shown to generally provide 
very good results for enzyme-inhibitor complexes. If it is known or assumed that the 
association of two proteins is mainly driven by their electrostatic interactions, then we select 
results obtained by the electrostatic-favored weights, in which the weight of the Kozakov et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptelectrostatics is doubled relative to the balanced energy expression. In contrast, for 
complexes primarily stabilized by hydrophobic interactions we use the hydrophobic-favored 
potential, which thus doubles the weight of the desolvation term. In the fourth option, van 
der Waals + electrostatics, the pairwise potential Epair is not used. The need for this option 
occurs for proteins that are very different from the ones used for the parameterization of 
EDARS . The selection of the parameters in the Others Mode will be discussed further in this 
protocol. We recognize that the weights in the PIPER energy function are somewhat 
arbitrary, and were selected to optimize the success rates for different classes of protein 
complexes. However, as described below, the most likely models of the complex are selected 
on the basis of cluster population rather than energy value. In fact, PIPER does not aim to 
estimate the true interaction energy, and the score provided by ClusPro should not be 
considered as a measure of binding affinity.
Model selection by cluster population
The second step of ClusPro is clustering the lowest energy 1000 docked structures using 
pairwise IRMSD as the distance measure.12,21 We calculate IRMSD values for each pair 
among the 1000 structures, and find the structure that has the highest number of neighbors 
within 9Å IRMSD radius. The selected structure will be defined as the center of the first 
cluster, and the structures within the 9Å IRMSD neighborhood of the center will constitute 
the first cluster. The members of this cluster are then removed, and we select the structure 
with the highest number of neighbors within the 9Å IRMSD radius among the remaining 
structures as the next cluster center. These neighbors will form the next cluster. Up to 30 
clusters are generated in this manner. After clustering we minimize the energy of the 
retained structures for 300 step with fixed backbone using only the van der Waals term of the 
Charmm potential31. The minimization removes the steric overlaps but generally yields only 
very small conformational changes. In its basic operation ClusPro outputs the structures at 
the centers of the 10 most populated clusters.
Considering the centers of the large clusters of low energy structures rather than simply low 
energy structures appears to be unique to ClusPro,32 and may implicitly account for some 
entropic effects.33 We have recently shown that under fairly natural assumptions the cluster 
populations are proportional to cluster probability. This argument is based on considering 
the approximate partition function Q = Σj exp(-E j /RT) , where Ej is the energy of the jth 
pose, and the summation includes all structures generated by the docking. Similarly, for the 
kth low energy cluster the partition function can be approximated by Qk = Σj exp(E j /RT) , 
where now we consider only the structures in the cluster. In terms of these approximate 
partition functions the probability of the kth cluster is given by Pk = Q k/Q. Furthermore, 
within the low energy cluster we introduce the approximation Ej=E, i.e. , we assume that that 
the energy values are the same for all structures in the cluster, because the energies are from 
a narrow range that is comparable to the uncertainty of the energy function. Due to this 
assumption the probability of the cluster is given by Pk=exp(-E/RT)×N k/Q, and thus it is 
proportional to the number Nk of the structures in the kth cluster. Therefore we suggest 
finding the most populated clusters rather than the lowest energy structures and using the 
centers of the clusters as putative models. Although this approach to model selection is 
somewhat unusual and has not been widely adopted, we believe that the consistent success Kozakov et al. Page 5
Nat Protoc . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptof ClusPro in the CAPRI experiment34–38 supports its use (see the section Comparison to 
other methods for details on the performance of ClusPro). Since it was requested by a 
number of users, ClusPro also outputs the PIPER energies of cluster centers, as well as the 
lowest PIPER energy within each cluster. However, since these values do not include 
entropic contributions and the weights of the energy components are selected to yield near-
native structures rather than correct thermodynamics of binding, the PIPER energy does not 
provide valid information on binding free energy, and should not be used for ranking the 
models. We repeatedly emphasize that the latter is based on cluster population rather than 
cluster energy score.
Applications of the method
The usage of the ClusPro server has been growing beyond our expectations. By June 2016 
the server had over 17,000 users (among them over 7,000 registered, which is not required), 
and completed more than 172,000 docking calculations, currently adding about 3,000 per 
month. Models built by the server have been reported in over 400 publications. These 
statistics demonstrate that there is substantial need for protein-protein docking, and that 
implementing our algorithms as a server expanded the availability of the method to parts of 
the research community without experience in computational structural biology. The large 
number of publication also implies that we can follow how the server is employed. We 
describe here some of the typical applications, each illustrated by examples.
Docking X-ray or NMR structures of proteins— This is the most basic and 
straightforward application of ClusPro. As an early example, Chance and co-workers 
constructed the three-dimensional structure of cofilin, an important actin binding protein, 
bound to monomeric actin39,40. The binding model was validated by hydroxyl radical-
mediated oxidative protein footprinting, and identified key ionic and hydrophobic 
interactions at the binding interface39. Models can be frequently used for mechanistic 
interpretation. For example, Luxán et al.41 docked JAG1, a cell surface protein that interacts 
with receptors in the mammalian Notch signaling pathway, to the dimers of the E3 ubiquitin-
protein ligase MIB1, and used the results to show that certain mutations of MIB1 arrest 
chamber myocardium development, preventing trabecular maturation and compaction, and 
thereby cause left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.
Modeling antibody-antigen interactions— The analysis of antibody-antigen 
interactions is a particularly important modeling and docking problem, required in 
biotechnology and vaccine design applications. For example, Tran et al.42 crystallized the 
Fab fragments of two vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to HIV-1 
gp120. Alanine scanning of their complementarity-determining regions, coupled with 
epitope scanning of their epitopes on gp120, revealed putative contact residues. Using this 
information they docked the Fabs to gp120. Coupled with EM reconstructions of the mAb-
gp120 complexes, the docking results suggested that the antibodies use a distinct approach 
to the HIV-1 primary receptor binding site, and this information was used for vaccine 
redesign.Kozakov et al. Page 6
Nat Protoc . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptConstructing the structure of large multi-domain proteins— We reviewed the 
work43 by Kuriyan and co-workers44, who combined computational docking, small-angle x-
ray scattering, mutagenesis, and calorimetry to study the histone domain of the Ras-specific 
nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless (SOS). They have shown that the domain folds 
into the rest of SOS and interacts with a helical linker that connects the pleckstrin-homology 
(PH) and Dbl-homology (DH) domains to the catalytic domain of SOS. Results suggested 
that the histone domain is a potential mediator of membrane-dependent activation signals44.
Building homo-oligomers of proteins— Examples are the construction of the human 
p53-controlled ribonucleic reductase (p53R2) homodimer, which was used to explain 
mutations that cause mitochondrial DNA depletion45, and the modeling of an L-type Ca2+ 
channel used for the characterization of interactions with 1,4-dihydropyridines46. 
Determination of homo-oligomeric proteins by docking from monomeric structures solved 
by NMR spectroscopy is frequently required, because NMR determination of multimers by 
NMR is far from simple due to the lack of chemical shift perturbation data and the difficulty 
of obtaining a sufficient number of intermonomer distance restraints. For example, 
Zweckstetter and co-workers47 determined the solution structure of the 15.4 kDa homodimer 
CylR2, the regulator of cytolysin production from Enterococcus faecalis, by combining the 
available experimental information with docking.
Protein-peptide docking— Although in the present form ClusPro is not an appropriate 
tool for docking very flexible peptides to proteins, the server can be used if some 
information on the protein-bound structure of the peptide is available. For example, to study 
activating mutations of STAT5B in lymphomas, Chan and co-workers48 docked a 
phosphorylated self-peptide to the homology model of the SH2 domain of a STAT5B 
mutant. In spite of docking a flexible peptide to a homology model, which may have some 
structural deviations from the X-ray structure, this analysis was feasible, because highly 
homologous templates of the SH2 domain with bound peptides were available, and provided 
both a peptide structure and the key binding residues of STAT5B.
Docking of homology models— The ClusPro server is frequently used for docking 
homology models. For example, Williams and co-workers49 studied the specificity of 
binding of KirCII, a trans-acting acyltransferase, to a panel of acyl carrier proteins, by 
docking a homology model of KirCII. In addition to ClusPro, the author used the PatchDock 
server50, and considered the convergence of the two methods on very similar models as part 
of the validation. Steeland et al.51 studied the binding of small single domain antibodies to 
human tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) using homology models of both proteins. 
Results were used for the design of selective inhibitors of the TNF/TNFR interaction51. 
However, while we explored relatively well the performance of ClusPro for docking X-ray 
structures16, we have somewhat limited experience with homology models, and our 
incomplete analysis suggests that even moderate errors in key side chains or loops may 
substantially reduce the accuracy of docking results. Therefore we have recently collected a 
benchmark set of proteins to facilitate the development of methods that integrate homology 
modeling and docking52.Kozakov et al. Page 7
Nat Protoc . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptExperimental Design
We describe here a number of advanced options for use in ClusPro as follows.
Structure Modification— Structure modification is suggested if any of the proteins has an 
unstructured or uncertain terminal region. Such regions may occur as the result of chemical 
tagging in the purification process, or may be created by homology modeling programs due 
to the lack of templates for the given region. Removal of such regions is frequently 
advantageous, because they can interfere with rigid body docking. When using this option, 
the server removes terminal residues until a regular secondary structure (alpha helix, 
extended strand, 3-helix, π-helix, or a hydrogen bonded turn) would be reached within 2 
amino acid residues along the sequence. The modification can be requested for the receptor, 
the ligand, or both, and applies to both ends of the chain.
Attraction and Repulsion— If experimental information is available that indicates 
certain residues are involved in binding, whereas other residues remain surface accessible 
upon complex formation, this can be used to influence the results of the docking by setting 
attraction and repulsion, respectively, on these residues. To specify attraction, the user must 
enter the residues in one or both sides of the interface that are believed to participate in the 
binding. In the docking calculations an extra attractive force is applied to the selected 
residues. Repulsion can be specified similarly, by selecting a number of residues that are not 
expected to be in the interface, and hence are the origins of repulsive interactions in the 
docking. Alternatively one can upload a protein data bank (PDB) file containing the residues 
that are not supposed to be in the interface and hence are “masked” during the docking 
calculations by adding a repulsive force component. The masking files specify the amino 
acids that do not participate in intermolecular interaction, and hence substantially restrict the 
conformational space that can be occupied by the complex.
Restraints— We have recently added to ClusPro the option to define pairwise distance 
restraints. Such restraints can be derived, e.g., from NMR Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) 
experiments or by chemical crosslinking. A pairwise distance restraint can be defined by two 
sets of atoms, S 1 and S 2 and a distance range, d min to d max. The restraint is considered 
satisfied if there are at least one atom in S 1 and at least one atom in S 2 such that the distance 
between them falls in this range. While the implementation allows for arbitrary sets of atoms 
to be used to define a restraint, most frequently these involve a single atom or residue on 
each side of the interface. Given multiple restraints, users may want to require a certain 
number of restraints out of a group to be satisfied. In addition, restraints may be based on 
sources with varying reliability, requiring different cutoff values. Our implementation allows 
for grouping restraints into restraint groups, and restraint groups into restraint sets. Restraint 
groups are considered satisfied when more than a user specified number of restraints in the 
group are satisfied, and a restraint set is satisfied when more than a user specified number of 
its groups are satisfied. When a restraint set is provided, ClusPro will only report solutions 
that satisfy the restraints. To do this efficiently, for each rotation we first generate the set of 
translations that satisfy each individual restraint, called the feasible translation set for the 
particular restraint. We then consider the intersection of feasible translation sets for the 
restraints in each restraint group, and select the translations that appear more often than the Kozakov et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcutoff for the restraint group. The selected feasible translation sets for each restraint group 
are merged in a similar way to generate the feasible translation set for an entire restraint set. 
Providing restraints can actually decrease the running times, since only the van der Waals 
interaction energy is computed for each feasible translation, and translations that result in 
unacceptable clashes are skipped. After selecting the solutions that satisfy the restraints, 
1000 structures with the lowest PIPER energies are clustered and minimized as customary in 
ClusPro.
The Others Mode— The Others Mode uses a special scoring scheme to target the 
complexes that are classified as “others” in the established protein-protein docking 
benchmark22–25,53. The motivation for developing a special scoring function is their diverse 
nature and their generally limited shape and electrostatic complementarity. To overcome 
these challenges we use three different sets of weighting coefficients, generate 500 structures 
with each, and cluster the resulting 1500 conformations (Table 1). This is the only case when 
we consider 1500 rather than 1000 docked structures. In view of the assumed weaker shape 
complementarity and higher structural uncertainty we reduce the coefficients of Eattr and 
Eelec, and use three different values for the coefficient of EDARS.  The 1500 structures are 
mixed and clustered together, and the centers of well-populated clusters are considered as 
models of the complex. Our docking studies15 confirm that the strategy substantially 
improves the overall success rates for the “other” type of complexes, in agreement with the 
assumption that the interaction energy of these complexes cannot be well described by a 
single set of coefficients.
The Antibody Mode— In the “Antibody Mode” PIPER uses a potential developed for 
docking antibody and antigen pairs.54 Analysis of antibody–protein antigen complexes has 
revealed inherent asymmetry between the two sides of the interface. Specifically, 
phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues highly populate the paratope of the antibody 
but not the epitope of the antigen. Since this asymmetry cannot be adequately modeled using 
the symmetric pairwise potential generally used in PIPER, we have removed the usual 
assumption of symmetry. Interaction statistics were extracted from antibody–protein 
complexes under the assumption that the interaction preferences of an atom of a particular 
type on the antibody differ from the preferences of an atom of the same type on the antigen. 
The use of the new potential significantly improved the performance of docking for 
antibody–protein antigen complexes54. The method allows for the masking of non-paratope 
residues, either by using automated selection or by providing a masking file as described for 
the Attraction and Repulsion option.
Multimer Docking— A subclass of interactions between proteins is the case where two or 
more identical proteins interact to form a homomultimer. The construction of such 
multimers is frequently required, because a number of proteins have been solved as 
monomers but exist in a homomultimeric state in vivo. We have developed a special mode in 
our docking where we limit the rotations sampled by the docking algorithm to rotations that 
satisfy either C 2 or C 3 symmetry, respectively, for dimers and trimers55. The updated 
method we currently use is similar to the one developed by the Weng lab and implemented 
in the M-ZDOCK program56, with some differences that result in a slightly simpler Kozakov et al. Page 9
Nat Protoc . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptalgorithm. The difference is that Pierce et al.56 rotate the receptor protein in the process of 
generating symmetric structures, whereas ClusPro rotates the coordinate system. Since the 
new method has not been published, we provide the steps of the algorithm here. (1) Center 
the receptor (the input monomer) at the origin. (2) Select values for the Euler angles ψ and θ 
to define an axis of rotation. (3) Copy the receptor, and rotate it by 360°/N around the axis of 
rotation to create the ligand, where N=2 for a dimer and N=3 for a trimer. (4) Discretize both 
the ligand and receptor, with a grid spacing of 1 Å. (5) Perform FFT search in the plane 
perpendicular to the axis of rotation for the best scoring multimer position. Since the search 
space is now restricted to S2 rather than the rotational group S3, a set of points uniformly 
distributed on the sphere is generated using the S2 sequence code from https://mitchell-
lab.biochem.wisc.edu/SOI/index.php . This set of points is used as the basis for symmetric 
rotations of 180 degrees (dimer) and 120 degrees (trimer). Symmetry is enforced during 
docking by considering only translations within 2Å of the plane defined by the axis of 
rotation and passing through the center of rotation. (6) Repeat Steps 2 through 5 for all ψ 
and θ values on a grid with 5 degrees step size. The 1000 lowest energy structures are 
retained and clustered as in the general ClusPro docking.
SAXS Profile— Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments are based on observing 
the X-ray scattering of a macromolecule in solution at different scattering angles, resulting 
in a one-dimensional scattering profile. While the SAXS profile provides information about 
the shape and size of the molecule57, the amount of such information is much lower than the 
one that can be obtained by X-ray crystallography, and on its own does not provide atom-
level resolution. This makes docking a natural complement to SAXS for the determination 
of complex structures. ClusPro can account for SAXS experimental data by retaining a 
number of docked structures that best agree with the provided SAXS profile58. These 
structures are then ranked by the PIPER scoring function and clustered as usual in ClusPro, 
thus the information from SAXS is used only to filter the structures generated by PIPER and 
the search is not biased by modifying the scoring function as done in a number of other 
methods that account for SAXS results59,60. The advantage of this approach is that the 
docked structures are restrained rather than determined by the SAXS data, and hence the 
method can be used even with moderately informative SAXS profiles58.
Heparin Ligand— Many proteins bind the polysaccharides heparan sulfate and heparin. 
Heparan sulfate (HS) consists of alternating hexuronic acid and D-glucosamine disaccharide 
units. Variations in sulfation and hexuronic acid structure result in various HS 
molecules61–64. Heparin, a member of the HS family, consists of highly-sulfated 
disaccharides, and is frequently used as a model compound in studies of protein-HS 
interactions65. Since crystallizing protein-heparin complexes for structure determination is 
generally difficult, docking can be a useful approach for understanding specific interactions, 
and hence we have extended PIPER and ClusPro to heparin docking66. The method 
generates and evaluates close to a billion poses of a heparin tetrasaccharide. The docked 
structures are clustered using pairwise RMSD as the distance measure. However, since we 
use a generic heparin structure as a probe, and since there are not enough protein-heparin 
complex structures to improve the interaction potential, clustering the docked heparin 
structures and selecting the clusters with the highest protein-ligand contacts predict only the Kozakov et al. Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptheparin binding sites rather than bound heparin poses66. Nevertheless, the cluster centers can 
provide starting points for further refinement of heparin positions using methods that 
account for flexibility, e.g., molecular dynamics.
Comparison to existing methods
Table 2 shows a classification of direct protein-protein docking methods based on the 
amount of the information that is required in addition to the structures of the component 
proteins8. Each class of methods has its own strengths and limitations. Global methods are 
the most useful when no a priori  information on the complex is available, and hence the 
entire 6D conformational space must be sampled. Since such methods use rigid body 
approximation, they allow only for moderate conformational change upon binding, which is 
a major limitation. The medium-range methods such as RosettaDock67 and ATTRACT68 can 
sample only selected regions of the conformational space and hence require some 
information on the putative complex, but the Monte Carlo or similar search algorithms can 
account for some level of flexibility, primarily in side chains. Therefore these methods are 
particularly useful when side chain conformations are very uncertain, for example when one 
of the component protein structures is a homology model, but some information is available 
on the structure of the complex to identify the region of interest in the conformational space. 
Finally, restraint based docking, exemplified by the program HADDOCK (High Ambiguity 
Driven biomolecular DOCKing)69,70, incorporates interaction restraints into the scoring 
function to guide the search toward regions of the conformational space in which the 
restraints are satisfied. The method can work very well if a sufficient number of correct 
restraints are available, but performance may deteriorate without them.
The quality of docking methods is continuously monitored by CAPRI (Critical Assessment 
of Predicted Interactions), the ongoing communitywide experiment devoted to protein 
docking71. In the CAPRI challenge, initiated in 2003, participating research groups and 
automated servers are given prediction targets, each being an unpublished experimentally 
determined structure of a protein-protein complex. Given the atomic coordinates of the 
component proteins or of their homologues, the participants have to model the complexes. 
Servers must submit results within two days, whereas human predictor groups have several 
weeks and can use any available information. Each group can submit ten predictions for 
each target. The submitted models are evaluated by independent assessors. For each group or 
server, the assessors report the number of targets with acceptable or better quality 
predictions, and also note the number of targets for which highly accurate (***) or medium 
accuracy (**) models were submitted. These categories have been defined on the basis of the 
fraction of native contacts, the backbone root mean square deviation of the ligand (LRMSD) 
from the reference ligand structure after superimposing the receptor structures, and the 
backbone RMSD of the interface residues (IRMSD). The calculation of these measures and 
the exact definitions of categories were given in the first CAPRI evaluation paper72. 
Although the CAPRI quality score is based on a number of characteristics including several 
RMSD measures and the predicted fraction of native contacts, for simplicity we focus on 
LRMSD, and note that for the highly accurate, medium accuracy, acceptable, and incorrect 
models the ligand LRMSD is given by LRMSD < 1Å, 1Å < LRMSD < 5Å, 5Å < LRMSD < 
10Å, and LRMSD > 10Å, respectively.Kozakov et al. Page 11
Nat Protoc . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptSince its release in 2004, ClusPro has consistently been the best automated server in the 
CAPRI challenge. Table 3 shows the performance of the four best servers based on the 
results of the last three CAPRI evaluation meetings in 200936, 201337, and 2016. These 
results confirm that the global systematic sampling of the entire conformational space as 
performed by ClusPro is useful when essentially no a priori  information on the structure of 
the target complex can be used, which is generally the case for servers that must submit 
results within two days, directly produced by the server. The only freedom we had using 
ClusPro was the choice of the energy coefficient set. The comparison of different methods is 
more complex if the performance of both “human” predictor groups and servers is 
considered (Table 4). Because predictors can use additional information, medium-range 
methods such as ATTRACT by Zaccharias68,73, SWARMDOCK by Bates74, and 
FRODOCK by the Chacon group75, recently combined with a new scoring scheme by 
Guerois76, performed well. The restraint based HADDOCK method by Bonvin and co-
workers also provided good predictions for many targets69,70. However, good results were 
also obtained by several methods that, similarly to ClusPro, perform global search assuming 
rigid proteins, including ZDOCK53,77, GRAMM78, and PatchDock50. Our own group’s 
“human” predictions are based on running ClusPro, followed by refinement and selection of 
most likely clusters”79, in some cases involving Monte Carlo minimization runs either using 
RosettaDock67 or our own implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm80. For a few targets 
the refinement improved medium accuracy structures into highly accurate ones, but 
generally the impact was moderate, and in 2016 we actually lost an acceptable prediction. 
According to Table 4, the relative performance of ClusPro has been improving over the 
years, and based on the 2016 results the server appears to be competitive with the best 
“human” predictor groups. We note that the PIPER scoring function has been recently used 
in an algorithm that expands FFT-based sampling to five rotational coordinates81. Working 
in a space with spherical coordinates defined as a manifold, the new 5D algorithm retains the 
accuracy of PIPER for globular proteins while providing at least 10-fold speedup. However, 
moderate loss of accuracy may occur for proteins that are very elongated along some 
direction. An additional advantage of the method is that increasing the number of correlation 
function terms is computationally inexpensive, which enables using even more complex 
energy functions as well as accounting for any number of pairwise distance constraints81.
Limitations
PIPER performs rigid body docking in the 6D space of rotations and translations. The rigid 
body assumption is a good approximation for several classes of protein complexes, e.g., for 
most enzyme-inhibitor complexes (Supplementary Table 1). In fact, PIPER uses a “soft” 
potential that allows for certain steric overlaps. However, the protein-protein docking 
benchmark set22–25 also includes a number of “difficult” targets, i.e., complexes in which at 
least one of the proteins substantially changes backbone conformation upon binding. Neither 
PIPER nor any other rigid body method can produce acceptable docked structures for such 
complexes. However, we note that extending ClusPro to docking short flexible peptides to 
proteins is in preparation.
As discussed, unless requesting the “other” mode, ClusPro yields four sets of docked 
structures using the scoring schemes called (1) balanced, (2) electrostatic-favored, (3) Kozakov et al. Page 12
Nat Protoc . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 February 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscripthydrophobic-favored, and (4) van der Waals + electrostatics. In the “other” mode ClusPro 
generates structures using three different scoring schemes. The differences in the weighting 
of energy coefficients represent real differences in the biophysical forces that dominate 
interactions between two proteins, as the association in some complexes is driven primarily 
by electrostatic interactions, while in others desolvation of hydrophobic interfaces may be 
the main driving force. Unfortunately at present we are unable to perform automated 
selection of the best scoring scheme. Thus, it is left to the user to make such selection based 
on the assumed properties of the particular complex. If no such information is available, we 
suggest using the balanced option, and the “other” mode for signal transduction complexes. 
It is generally a good sign if the selected parameters lead to a cluster of low energy 
structures that is substantially more populated than the others. It is also useful if different 
parameter sets yield the same model. Once a model is selected, the user can also explore 
whether the assumption used was correct by analyzing the properties of the interface. 
Nevertheless, we recognize that the problem of parameter selection is not resolved, and 
further research is needed.
Even assuming that a parameter set is selected, ClusPro returns ten clusters of low energy 
structures, the center of each cluster representing a putative model of the complex. Again, 
the existence of a large cluster provides some level of certainty, but generally additional 
information is needed for reliable model selection. As mentioned, we found over 400 
publications that reported models constructed by ClusPro. In many applications the models 
were validated by experimental techniques, including site-directed mutagenesis with NMR, 
calorimetry, FRET, or surface plasmon resonance44,82–101, cross-linking102–106, various 
spectroscopic methods107–113, X-ray scattering114, electron self-exchange reaction115, 
radiolytic protein footprinting with mass spectrometry39,40, hydrogen/deuterium 
exchange116, or intermolecular Nuclear Overhauser Effect restraints47. ClusPro results can 
also be used to design low resolution and hence cost effective validation experiments. We 
believe that such combination of computational and experimental tools is the most 
meaningful use of docking.
In addition to the above fundamental limitations we have several technical shortcomings that 
we hope remove in the future. Some of these shortcomings are as follows: (1) At this point 
the molecules to be docked can include only standard amino acids, nucleic acids to define an 
RNA molecule as the receptor, and heparin as the ligand. Thus, the docking cannot account 
for the presence of co-factors or other small ligands that can be important in the modulation 
of protein-protein interactions. (2) Similarly, we are unable to account for non-standard or 
modified amino acids, e.g. phosphorylation, another important factor that can affect the 
interactions. (3) Currently ClusPro can create only dimers and trimers in the Multimer 
Docking mode, and does not provide an option for constructing more complex multimers. 
(4) There are two limitations on size of the proteins to be docked. First, uploaded files 
cannot be more than 10MB each. Second, the total grid size cannot be more than roughly 
40×106 Å3, which corresponds to a cube of ~350 Å in each dimension. This grid has to 
contain both the receptor and ligand in each potential relative orientation of the two 
molecules.Kozakov et al. Page 13

The NFAT family of transcription factors encompasses
fiveproteinsevolutionarilyrelatedtotheRel/NF /H9260Bfam-
ily (Chytil and Verdine 1996; Graef et al. 2001b). Theprimordial family member is NFAT5, the only NFAT-
related protein represented in the Drosophila genome.
NFAT5isidenticaltoTonEBP(tonicityelementbindingprotein), a transcription factor crucial for cellular re-sponses to hypertonic stress (López-Rodríguez et al.1999; Miyakawa et al. 1999). We focus here on the re-maining four NFAT proteins (NFAT1–NFAT4, also
known as NFATc1–c4; see Table 1), referring to them
collectively as NFAT.
The distinguishing feature of NFAT is its regulation
byCa
2+andtheCa2+/calmodulin-dependentserinephos-
phatase calcineurin. NFAT proteins are phosphorylated
and reside in the cytoplasm in resting cells; upon stimu-
lation, they are dephosphorylated by calcineurin, trans-locate to the nucleus, and become transcriptionally ac-
tive, thus providing a direct link between intracellular
Ca
2+signaling and gene expression. NFAT activity is
further modulated by additional inputs from diversesignaling pathways, which affect NFAT kinases and
nuclear partner proteins. In the first part of this review,

Recent structural data emphasize the remarkable
versatility of NFAT binding to DNA. At composite
NFAT:AP-1 elements found in the regulatory regions ofmany target genes, NFAT proteins bind cooperatively
with an unrelated transcription factor, AP-1 (Fos–Jun;
Chenetal.1998).AtDNAelementsthatresembleNF /H9260B

NFATalsoactssynergisticallywithtranscriptionfactorsother than Fos and Jun, but the structural basis for syn-
ergy remains unknown. Drawing on published struc-
tures, we discuss the potential cooperation of NFAT
with other classes of DNA-binding proteins.It is clear that NFAT activates transcription of a large
number of genes during an effective immune response(Rao et al. 1997; Kiani et al. 2000; Serfling et al. 2000;
Macián et al. 2001). In the third part of this review, we
present information obtained from these studies, high-
lighting experimental and bioinformatics approaches toidentifying NFAT target genes. We discuss the finding
that NFAT and NFAT–Fos–Jun complexes activate dis-
tinct subsets of target genes in lymphocytes (Macián et
al. 2002). We also describe a novel aspect of gene regu-
lation by NFAT, in which this transcription factor par-ticipates in an early phase of chromatin remodeling that
occurs at specific genetic loci in differentiating T cells
(Avni et al. 2002).
There is evidence that NFAT regulates cell differen-
tiation programs in cell types other than immune cells(Crabtree and Olson 2002; Horsley and Pavlath 2002;
Graef et al. 2003; Hill-Eubanks et al. 2003). In the last
section of this review, we select three differentiation
programs—fiber-typespecificationindifferentiatedskel-
etal muscle, cardiac valve development, and osteoclast
differentiation—for detailed consideration. We evaluate
theevidenceforNFATinvolvement,pointoutnovelcel-lular and molecular mechanisms that might regulate

NFAT knockout mice have been reviewed elsewhere
(CrabtreeandOlson2002;HorsleyandPavlath2002),werefer to them only as necessary to illustrate specific
points.
CellularinputsaffectingNFAT
Ca

NFAT is activated by cell-surface receptors coupled to
“store-operated” Ca2+entry via phospholipase C (Fig. 1).
The importance of this process is illustrated by patients
with a rare form of hereditary severe combined immu-
nodeficiency(Feskeetal.2000,2001).Tcellsfromthese
patients showed multiple cytokine deficiency and a se-lective inability to activate NFAT; NF /H9260B and AP-1 acti-
vation were normal. The primary defect was traced toa pronounced reduction in store-operated Ca
2+entry,
which led to a marked impairment in activation of allNFATs.4Correspondingauthor.

the NFAT regulatory domain, a conserved ∼300-amino-
acid region located N-terminal to the DNA-binding do-
main (Fig. 2). This domain is encoded in a single exon inall four NFAT proteins from all vertebrate species for
which sequence data are available (Graef et al. 2001b).
The domain is heavily phosphorylated in resting cells,
with the phosphorylated residues (serines) distributed
among four classes of conserved serine-rich sequencemotifs (SRR-1, SPxx repeat, SRR-2, and KTS motifs; Fig.
2; Beals et al. 1997a; Okamura et al. 2000). Calcineurin
dephosphorylates three of the four types of motifs, thus
triggering NFAT nuclear accumulation and increasing
theaffinityofNFATforitstargetsitesinDNA(Shawetal. 1995; Okamura et al. 2000; Porter et al. 2000; Neal
and Clipstone 2001). It is not formally known whether
dephosphorylation is an ordered process, but mass spec-
trometry experiments suggest that the SRR1 region,
which is immediately adjacent to the major calcineurin
dockingsite(PxIxIT;seebelow),ispreferentiallydephos-
phorylated at low calcineurin activity (Okamura et al.2000). NFAT mutants with small deletions or S →A
substitutions in the SRR1 region are more susceptiblethan wild-type NFAT to dephosphorylation of the SPxx
repeats by calcineurin (Zhu et al. 1998; Aramburu et al.
1999).
Efficient dephosphorylation requires a docking inter-
action between NFAT and calcineurin (Aramburu et al.1998, 1999; Chow et al. 1999; J. Liu et al. 2001). The
major docking site for calcineurin is located at the N
terminus of the NFAT regulatory domain, and has the
consensus sequence PxIxIT (SPRIEIT in NFAT1; Fig. 2).
The individual NFAT proteins possess characteristicPxIxIT sequences with a low affinity for calcineurin
(K
d= 10–30 µM), needed to maintain sensitivity to envi-
ronmental signals and prevent constitutive activation of
NFAT. Substitution of the SPRIEIT sequence of NFAT1
withHPVIVIT,ahigher-affinityversionobtainedbypep-
tideselection,increasedthebasalcalcineurinsensitivityoftheproteinandresultedinpartialnuclearlocalization
(Aramburu et al. 1999). The A238L protein of African
swine fever virus, a potent viral inhibitor of NFAT,
contains a PKIIIT sequence that is likely to be interme-
diate in affinity between the SPRIEIT and HPVIVIT se-quences (Miskin et al. 2000). The surface of NFAT–cal-cineurin interaction is likely to be more extensive thanthe PxIxIT motif, however, because a second interactingsequence has been identified in NFAT2 and in NFAT4(Liu et al. 1999; Park et al. 2000). This sequence (calci-neurin-binding sequence B in Fig. 2) is moderately con-servedintheNFATproteinsandresemblesahighlycon-
served sequence in the calcineurin inhibitors DSCR1/
MCIP1(Fuentesetal.2000;KingsburyandCunningham
2000; Rothermel et al. 2000). Structural and cell-biologi-
calstudiesshouldestablishwhetherNFATandDSCR1/MCIP1 use this region for calcineurin binding and inhi-
bition, and whether they compete for calcineurin bind-
ing in cells.
In overexpression experiments, NFAT nuclear local-
ization is accompanied by some relocalization of calci-
neurinfromthecytoplasmintothenucleus(Shibasakiet
al. 1996). This process has been documented for endog-enous calcineurin and NFAT1 in primary keratinocytes
(Al-Daraji et al. 2002), but is not readily observed for the
endogenous proteins in other cell types. Nevertheless, it
is clear that calcineurin is present in the nucleus of
stimulated cells, where it maintains the dephosphory-lated status and nuclear localization of NFAT. When
Ca
2+entry is prevented or calcineurin activity is inhib-
ited, NFAT is rephosphorylated by NFAT kinases andrapidly leaves the nucleus (t
1/2∼15 min), and NFAT-
dependent gene expression is terminated (Garrity et al.
1994; Loh et al. 1996a,b; Timmerman et al. 1996). As a
result of this absolute dependence on Ca2+/calcineurin
signaling, NFAT has a remarkable ability to sense dy-
namic changes in intracellular Ca2+levels ([Ca2+]I) and

The parameters of Ca2+/calcineurin signaling can be

2+]Iby modulating the expression of
members of the DSCR/MCIP family of endogenous cal-
cineurin inhibitors. This process incorporates a negative
feedback loop: Calcineurin/NFAT signals up-regulateDSCR1/MCIP1 expression, which then feeds back to
down-regulate calcineurin activity (J. Yang et al. 2000).

different NFAT proteins may be regulated by overlap-

Because phosphorylation specifies the subcellulardistribution, DNA binding affinity, and transcriptionalactivity of NFAT (Shaw et al. 1995; Beals et al. 1997a;Okamura et al. 2000; Porter et al. 2000; Neal and Clip-stone 2001), regulation of each NFAT protein by mul-tiplekinasesshouldintheorypermitanalmostcontinu-ous modulation of the level of NFAT activation.
Although several NFAT kinases have been identified,
an integrated picture of NFAT phosphorylation has notyet emerged. CK1 and GSK3 are constitutive NFAT ki-

Figure1. Schematic view of the NFAT activation cycle. NFAT is activated by cell-surface receptors coupled to Ca2+mobilization:
Immunoreceptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC)- /H9253, while G-
protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) activate PLC /H9252. PLC activation raises intracellular free Ca2+levels ([Ca2+]I) in several sequential
steps:Hydrolysisofphosphatidylinositol(PI)-4,5-bisphosphate(PIP2)byPLCresultsingenerationofinositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate(IP3);
IP3 binds to IP3 receptors (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum (blue compartment) and promotes a brief spike of [Ca2+]Iincrease by
depleting ER Ca2+stores; and store depletion is sensed by an as-yet-uncharacterized signaling mechanism that triggers a sustained

Potentially, calcineurin and NFATcould be localized to the vicinity of plasma membrane signaling complexes containing LTCC, NMDA receptors, and scaffold/adapterproteins such as PSD95 and AKAP-79. Alternatively, as suggested for CREB activation, the mechanism could involve selectiveactivation of MAPK pathways via calmodulin bound to LTCC (Dolmetsch et al. 2001).TranscriptionalregulationbyNFAT

gets NFAT1 and NFAT3 (Chow et al. 1997; Gómez del
Arco et al. 2000; Yang et al. 2002). For JNK1, a proposed
mechanism is that phosphorylation of the SPRIEIT cal-
cineurin-dockingsiteofNFAT2blockstheinteractionof
NFAT2 with calcineurin (Chow et al. 2000).
Selective activation of export kinases explains how
individual NFAT proteins might be differentially reg-ulated in a single cell type. For instance, developing
skeletal muscle cells show selective nuclear localiza-
tion of NFAT2 in conjunction with cytoplasmic local-ization of NFAT1 and NFAT4 (Abbott et al. 1998).
This behavior is also observed in T cells stimulated
for 5–6 h through the T-cell receptor (TCR; Loh et al.
1996a); it could occur through activation of export
kinases selective for NFAT1 and/or inhibition of ex-port kinases selective for NFAT2. In another illustra-tion, NFAT3 in hippocampal neurons remained nuclearfor 60–90 min after brief depolarization with high K
+,
reflecting either inhibition of an NFAT3 kinase or un-usually prolonged calcineurin activation (Graef et al.1999). In T cells, T-cell receptor stimulation is coupled
toCa
2+/calcineurinsignalingandNFATnuclearimport,
where as stimulation through the costimulatory recep-
tor CD28 potentiates activation of the PI-3 kinase path-
way and hence the kinase Akt/PKB (Parry et al. 1997;
Cantrell 2002). Akt promotes an inhibitory phosphory-lation of GSK3 (Cross et al. 1995). The net result is that
CD28 costimulation, by activating Akt, inhibits GSK3
and therefore NFAT nuclear export, prolonging the
duration of NFAT nuclear residence in T cells stimu-
lated through both the TCR and CD28, relative to T
cells stimulated through the TCR alone (Diehn et al.
2002).
As with other transcription factors, NFAT transcrip-
tional activity may be regulated by modification of the
transactivation domains. This aspect has not been stud-ied extensively, however. Inducible phosphorylation ofthe transactivation domain has been observed forNFAT1,andmutationofthemodifiedserineseliminates

2208 GENES&DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on January 1, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from transcriptional activity (Okamura et al. 2000). The Cot1
and Pim1 kinases potentiate transactivation by NFAT1andNFAT2,respectively(deGregorioetal.2001;Rainioet al. 2002), but it is not known whether this occursthrough direct phosphorylation of the NFAT transacti-
vation domain.
Other considerations
Multisite phosphorylation: The phosphorylation status
of the regulatory domain specifies DNA-binding affinityas well as relative exposure of nuclear localization
(NLS) and nuclear export (NES) sequences (Shaw et al.
1995; Beals et al. 1997a; Okamura et al. 2000; Porter
et al. 2000; Neal and Clipstone 2001), but how this
occurs has not yet been elucidated at a structural level.The most likely hypothesis is that dephosphorylation
facilitatesaglobalconformationalswitchofNFATfrom
an inactive to an active conformation (Okamura et al.
2000), possibly by interrupting multiple interactions of
phosphorylated motifs with complementary sequences
on NFAT itself and/or on partner proteins (Beals et al.
1997a; Porter et al. 2000; Neal and Clipstone 2001).Multisite phosphorylation is known to increase the
sensitivity of biochemical processes to their signal-
inginputs(e.g.,seeNashetal.2001;Orlickyetal.2003).
In a mathematical model of the NFAT conforma-
tional switch, Salazar and Höfer (2003) addressed thelongstanding puzzle of why there are so many phos-
phorylation sites on NFAT, by calculating the sensi-
tivity of NFAT to changes in calcineurin activity as a
function of the number of dephosphorylations required
to induce the active conformation. If the number of de-phosphorylations was set at the 13 sites actually ob-
served for NFAT1 (Okamura et al. 2000), the dose-re-
sponse curve was steep and highly cooperative, defining
a threshold of calcineurin activity below which NFAT
remained inactive and above which full activation was
obtained. In contrast, if dephosphorylation at only 1–2
sites was postulated to be sufficient for full activation,a very shallow dose-response curve was obtained (i.e.,
evenalargeincreaseincalcineurinactivityinducedonly
a small increase in NFAT activity; Salazar and Höfer
2003).
Nuclear transport: The nuclear–cytoplasmic ratio
attained by an NFAT protein reflects not only the bal-ance of calcineurin and NFAT kinase activities, but
also the summation of import and export rates of
NLS-exposed and NES-exposed forms. The export kinet-
ics of NFAT lag behind the kinetics of its rephos-
phorylation in the nucleus (Loh et al. 1996a,b), possi-
bly because the phosphorylated SP motifs need to berestored to the proper configuration by the phos-
phoSP-selective prolyl isomerase Pin 1 (W. Liu et al.
2001). The import receptor for NFAT has not been
definitively identified, although a potential candidate
is Rch1 (Torgerson et al. 1998); the export receptoris most likely Crm1, the target of the nuclear exportinhibitor leptomycin B (Klemm et al. 1997; Kehlen-bach et al. 1998), which preferentially binds phos-phorylated NFAT1 (Okamura et al. 2000). It is not
clear whether phosphorylated NFAT exposes an intrin-
sic NES (as suggested for NFAT2; Klemm et al. 1997),
or whether NES function is conferred by proteins
such as 14.3.3 that bind to the phosphorylated form
(as suggested for NFAT3; Chow and Davis 2000). Theputative NES of 14.3.3 was shown to function globally
in ligand binding rather than directly mediating nu-
clear transport (Brunet et al. 2002), indicating that a dif-
ferent NES is needed. Whatever the specific mechan-
ism, import/export kinetics will contribute to averag-
ing NFAT activity under conditions of intermittent
stimulation.
Autoregulation of NFAT2: The shortest isoform of
NFAT2 (NFATc/A) is induced in a CsA-sensitive man-ner by NFAT itself, in a process suggested to constitute
a positive autoregulatory loop (Zhou et al. 2002). This
protein is generated through utilization of a distinctinducible promoter that is preferentially coupled to
the most proximal polyadenylation site (Chuvpilo
et al. 1999). As a result, NFATc/A lacks the entire
C-terminal domain and contains an alternate N-ter-
minal domain, which differs from that of other NFATisoforms in that it is not highly acidic. Positive auto-
regulation of one isoform of a transcription factor is
a familiar strategy in cell lineage commitment, because
it ensures that high levels of the factor are available
to maintain the committed state (Davidson 2001). The
fact that an NFAT2 isoform is the only NFAT pro-
tein subject to positive autoregulation explains whyNFAT2 is most often identified as the major NFAT
protein participating in a biological response (e.g., Th2
and osteoclast differentiation; Glimcher and Murphy
2000; Takayanagi et al. 2002). This important aspect of
gene regulation by NFAT is discussed more extensivelybelow.
Signaling pathways that affect AP-1 activity: As noted
below, the AP-1 transcription factor is a major trans-
criptional partner of NFAT (Macián et al. 2001). Clas-
sically, AP-1 consists of heterodimers of Fos- and Jun-family proteins: Fos proteins do not dimerize with one
another, and Jun dimers bind DNA with lower affinitythan Fos–Jun (Chinenov and Kerppola 2001; Jochum
et al. 2001; Mechta-Grigoriou et al. 2001). Because AP-1
activity is also modulated by diverse signaling inputs
(Davis 2000), NFAT:AP-1-dependent transcription inte-
grates a very large number of signaling pathways andprocesses: The magnitude and kinetics of [Ca
2+]Iin-
creases; the level of calcineurin activity; the activitiesof kinases that modulate NFAT nuclear export, DNA-
binding, or intrinsic transcriptional activity; the activi-
ties of PKC/MAP kinase pathways and other signal-
ing pathways that influence Fos–Jun synthesis and
activation; and the integrity of cytoskeletal interactions
and other intracellular processes that have more glo-
bal effects. In consequence, NFAT:AP-1-based reporterassays are ideal for overall evaluations of cellular signal-ing: In T cells stimulated through antigen and costimu-latory receptors, NFAT: AP-1 reporter activity is influ-encedbyoverexpressionofwild-typeormutantversionsTranscriptionalregulationbyNFAT

et al. 2000; Kaminuma et al. 2001). In other cell types,Ca
2+mobilization is coupled to stimulation through
receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled re-ceptors, and NFAT reporters would be useful in an un-biased quest for signaling molecules in these pathways
as well.
DiversemodesofDNAbindingbyNFAT
Structural relation to the Rel/NF /H9260B family
All five proteins of the NFAT family, NFAT1–NFAT4
and NFAT5/TonEBP, may be classified as members of
theextendedNF/H9260B/Relfamily(Fig.3).Theclassification
isbasedonthestructuralsimilaritiesoftheirDNA-bind-
ing domains, also known as Rel homology regions(RHR).ThecanonicalmodeofDNAbindingbytheRHR
has been well characterized in the structures of several
NF/H9260B–DNA complexes (Ghosh et al. 1995; Muller et al.
1995): The RHR contains two functionally distinct do-
mains, an N-terminal specificity domain (RHR-N) that
makesbase-specificDNAcontacts,andaC-terminaldo-
maininvolvedindimerformationandI /H9260Bbinding(RHR-
C;Fig.4;Huxfordetal.1998;JacobsandHarrison1998).
Of the five NFAT proteins, NFAT5/TonEBP shows the
highest degree of structural similarity to NF /H9260B, forming
a symmetric dimer with a striking resemblance to theNF/H9260B–DNA complex (Fig. 4, cf. A and B; Stroud et al.
2002). The detailed dimerization interactions mediated
by the RHR-C of NFAT5 are very similar to those ob-
served in NF/H9260B, but the unique feature of the NFAT5
dimer–DNAcomplexisaseconddimerinterfaceformed
by the E/H11032F loop of the RHR-N domain (Fig. 4B). As a
result, NFAT5 completely encircles its DNA (Fig. 4B),explaining the unusually slow dissociation kinetics ofthe NFAT5–DNA complex (Stroud et al. 2002).
TwoNFAT1dimercomplexes,boundto /H9260Bsitesfrom
theIL-8promoter and the HIV-1 LTR, have recently
been characterized at the structural level (Giffin et al.
2003; Jin et al. 2003). As in the NFAT5 and Rel dimercomplexes, the NFAT1 dimer interface resides in the
C-terminalregionoftheRHR(Fig.4C,D).However,this
interface is surprisingly different from the symmetric
andhydrophobicRHR-CdimerinterfaceseeninNFAT5
and NF/H9260B: It is asymmetric and largely hydrophilic, andinvolves residues not used in Rel or NFAT5. The inter-
face is essentially identical in the NFAT1 dimers bound
to the IL-8 and HIV-1 LTR /H9260B sites, but these two
NFAT1 dimer complexes differ significantly in theirRHR-N interactions and hence their overall conforma-
tion (Fig. 4, cf. C and D). Specifically, the NFAT1 dimer

through E/H11032F-loop interactions in the RHR-N domain, in
a manner similar to that seen in the NFAT5–DNA com-plex (Fig. 4, cf. B and C). In the ternary NFAT/Fos–Jun/
DNA complex (see Fig. 5; Chen et al. 1998), the E /H11032F loop

DNA binding by NFAT dimers is a versatile mecha-
nism permitting homo- and heterodimer formation atresponse elements with varying sequences and spacing.
Many of the RHR-C interface residues observed in the
NFAT1 dimer are conserved in NFAT2 and NFAT4; in
cases where the residues differ, interface complemen-
tarity appears to be maintained by covariation of the in-teracting residues. NFAT3 is a potential exception be-cause it has significantly different residues at positions

Modeling studies suggest that NFAT1, NFAT2, and
NFAT4 would be capable of forming both homo- and
heterodimers on /H9260B-like DNA sites. These interactions
are likely to be confined to the NFAT family, however:
Although NFAT1–4, NFAT5/TonEBP, and NF /H9260B/Rel
dimers can all bind similar DNA elements, their modesof dimerization are different (Fig. 4) and they respond to
distinct intracellular signals (López-Rodríguez et al.2001), suggesting that mixed NFAT/NFAT5/NF /H9260B dimers
do not normally occur.

Cooperative interactions with Fos–Jun proteins
in the nucleus
NFAT1–4 proteins form strong cooperative complexes
on DNA with the unrelated transcription factor AP-1
(Fos–Jun dimers; Fig. 5; Chen et al. 1998; Macián et al.
2001).TheternaryNFAT:Fos:Juncomplexesserveassig-
nal integrators for two diametrically different signaling
pathways, the calcium/calcineurin pathway that acti-
vates NFAT and the phorbol ester-responsive MAP ki-
nasepathwaythatpromotesthesynthesisandactivation

NFATandAP-1elementsarepreciselyapposedtocreatea true “composite” site (Fig. 5; Chen et al. 1998). The
residues involved in Fos–Jun contact are located largelyin the N-terminal RHR domains of NFAT, and form anextensivenetworkofmostlypolarinteractionswithresi-
dues in the basic leucine zipper regions of Fos and Jun;
they are not strong enough to stabilize the NFAT:AP-1
complex in the absence of DNA. The interacting resi-
dues are almost completely conserved in NFAT1–4 but
are absent from NFAT5 (López-Rodríguez et al. 1999),indicating that the ability to cooperate with Fos and Jun
was a late evolutionary development.

1999;forreview,seeRaoetal.1997;Maciánetal.2001).By analyzing a set of 11 experimentally verified NFAT:
AP-1compositesites,Keletal.(1999)demonstratedthat
the free energy of NFAT and AP-1 binding to their re-
spective subsites showed a striking inverse correlation,
in that strong NFAT binding tended to be paired withweak AP-1 binding and vice versa (see Table 2). Presum-
ably, the total free energy of binding is maintained
within a narrow range because of biological constraints,
such as a need for rapid disassembly of NFAT:AP-1-con-
taining transcription complexes when the initiatingstimulus decays.
Acommonfeatureofnaturalpromotersandenhancers

sands of base pairs interact through their RHR-C dimer
interfaces? In the ternary NFAT:AP-1/DNA complex,
the RHR-C residues involved in NFAT dimerization are
exposed to solvent but lie in a deep groove between theRHR-N and RHR-C, sterically precluding such interac-tions. However, given the multiple orientations ofRHR-C observed in different NFAT complexes, the

moting the assembly of long-range, higher-order NFAT:
AP-1 complexes. Further versatility would arise from
utilization of different NFAT–Fos–Jun combinations.With the advent of new reagents (“tethered AP-1”
dimers; Bakiri et al. 2002), constitutively active NFAT
proteins (Macián et al. 2002; Monticelli and Rao 2002;
Porter and Clipstone 2002), and mutant NFAT proteins
impaired for RHR-N or RHR-C-mediated dimer forma-
tion (Giffin et al. 2003; Jin et al. 2003), the functions of
different NFAT:AP-1 combinations and higher-orderNFAT:AP-1 complexes may be explicitly assessed.
Interactions with other transcription factors
In addition to its interaction with AP-1, NFAT engages
in direct protein–protein interactions and/or influences
transcription synergistically with several families of
transcription factors: proteins such as Maf, ICER, and
p21SNFT that belong to the same basic region-leucine
zipper (bZIP) family as AP-1 (Ho et al. 1996; Bodor et al.
2000; Bower et al. 2002); the zinc finger proteins GATA
(see below), and EGR (Decker et al. 1998, 2003); the he-lix–turn–helix domain proteins Oct, HNF3, and IRF-4
(Fürstenau et al. 1999; Bert et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2002;Rengarajanetal.2002);theMADS-boxproteinMEF2(forreview, see Olson and Williams 2000; Crabtree and Ol-son2002;McKinseyetal.2002);andthenuclearreceptorPPAR-/H9253(X.Y. Yang et al. 2000). For transcriptional part-
ners other than AP-1, it is not known whether the syn-
ergy with NFAT occurs in the context of true “compos-
ite” regulatory elements that have a defined geometry
and spatial orientation for cooperative binding of NFAT
and these partner proteins.
bZIP proteins other than Fos and Jun: The interaction
of NFAT with Fos–Jun proteins cannot be detected in
solution but is remarkably cooperative on DNA (Jain et
al.1992,1993a,b;Chenetal.1995;Cockerilletal.1995).
In contrast, another bZIP protein, Maf, was identified as
a transcriptional partner for NFAT based on a purely
protein–protein interaction in a yeast two-hybrid screen
(Hoetal.1996).Incotransfectionassays,NFATandMafsynergisticallyactivatedareporterplasmiddrivenbytheIL-4promoter.AlthoughcooperativeNFAT:Mafbinding
was not observed on the site originally investigated be-
causeoftheinverseorientationoftheNFATsiterelative
to the Maf binding site (Ho et al. 1996), Maf and NFAT
could conceivably cooperate at classical NFAT:AP-1
sites (Fig. 6). The key NFAT-binding residues in Jun arenot all conserved in Maf, but the modeled NFAT–Maf
interfacehasgoodshapeandchemicalcomplementarity.
MutagenesisstudiesindicatethatArg285ofJuniscriti-
cal for NFAT binding (Peterson et al. 1996); in the mod-
eled Maf/NFAT interface, a Gln residue in this position
can make similar contacts with NFAT.
Two other small bZIP proteins, ICER and p21SNFT,
have been reported to bind NFAT and inhibit NFAT-dependent transcription (Bodor et al. 2000; Bower et al.
2002). Again, ICER does not conserve all the critical
NFAT-binding residues in Jun, but the NFAT:ICER in-
terface has a plausible level of complementarity. In fact,the Tyr residue in ICER that corresponds to Arg 285 in
Jun could potentially interact with NFAT even more
strongly (Fig. 6). p21SNFT binds NFAT mainly as a het-
erodimer with Jun (Bower et al. 2002), and it is therefore
expected that the binding interactions are mostly medi-atedbyJunandwillbesimilartothatseenintheNFAT/
Fos–Jun/DNA complex.
IRF and EGR proteins: NFAT cooperates with IRF4 at
theIL-2andIL-4promoters (Hu et al. 2002; Rengarajan
et al. 2002) and with EGR-1 at the IL-2andTNF-/H9251pro-
moters(Deckeretal.1998,2003).Theseinteractionsare
not well characterized—the interacting domains havenotbeendelineated,andcompositeDNAelementshave
not been defined. In an IRF-4/NFAT complex modeled
onaputativecompositesitefromthe IL-4promoter(Hu
et al. 2002), IRF-4 and NFAT can potentially bind DNAsimultaneously,andtheirDNAbindingdomainscanin-teract;similarly,anEGR-1/NFATcomplexmodeledona

tion of the RHR-C poses uncertainty in modeling these
higher-order transcription complexes, it also increasesthelikelihoodthatNFATcouldinteractwithavarietyofpartners on different composite sites.

tocooperatewithAP-1wasaseffectiveasormoreeffec-
tive than wild-type NFAT1 in its ability to synergize
functionally with GATA3 in a transient reporter assay

tion of regulatory regions has not led to unambiguousidentification of a composite NFAT:GATA element
with specific spacing and orientation, and cooperative
NFAT:GATA binding on DNA has not been reported
(Table 3).
Biological implications
NFAT1–4 proteins bind DNA as monomers at cognate
(GGAA) sites (L. Chen, unpubl.), as dimers at /H9260B-likeresponseelements(Fig.4),andascooperativecomplexes
with Fos and Jun at NFAT:AP-1 composite sites (Fig. 5).
The general feature of these various complexes is that
the DNA-binding interactions and conformations of the
NFAT RHR-N are highly conserved, but the conforma-tion of the RHR-C is quite variable. This diversity of
binding modes arises, at least in part, from the fact that
NFAT is not an obligate dimer; thus, in contrast to Rel
andNFAT5proteins,whicharedimersunderallcircum-
stances, the RHR-N and RHR-C of NFAT are free toadopt a variety of orientations in different transcription
complexes. This remarkable conformational flexibility
of NFAT on different DNA sites is likely to facilitate
assembly of NFAT into distinct higher-order complexes
containing diverse DNA-binding partners, and would be
expected to modulate recruitment of specific transcrip-
tional coregulators in different promoter contexts (Lefs-tin and Yamamoto 1998; Agalioti et al. 2000; Escalante
et al. 2002), as illustrated for the POU-domain protein
Pit-1 (Scully et al. 2000).

Strategies for identification of distal regulatory
elements that bind NFAT
Although gene expression is ultimately regulated at the
proximal promoter, which binds RNA polymerase andthe core transcriptional machinery, distal regulatory re-gions have profound effects on the expression of nearly

The substi-tutions of E284, R285, and K292 of Junwith Gln, Gln, and Glu in Maf do not dis-rupt the interface hydrogen-bonding pat-tern significantly.

2214 GENES&DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on January 1, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from all genes (Davidson 2001). This is illustrated by the
fact that the proximal promoter alone rarely supportscorrect, cell-type-specific expression of a linked re-porter gene in transgenic mice—very large regions,amounting to hundreds of kilobases of surrounding
DNA, are often needed (Lakshmanan et al. 1999; Yui et
al. 2001). The presence of distal regulatory elements is a
general feature of NFAT target genes in T cells; in
particular, distal enhancers are present in all cytokinegenes that have been examined in sufficient detail, in-
cluding the IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-10, andIFN-/H9253genes
(Cockerill et al. 1993, 1995; Duncliffe et al. 1997; Agar-wal et al. 2000; Avni et al. 2002; Hawwari et al. 2002;
S.-H. Im, D.U. Lee, and A. Rao, unpubl.). Distal NFAT-
dependent gene regulatory elements have been located
experimentally by hunting for inducible DNase I hyper-sensitive sites whose induction is blocked by CsA or
FK506 (Cockerill et al. 1993, 1995; Duncliffe et al. 1997;
Agarwal et al. 2000; Hawwari et al. 2002). These regions
often (but not always) correspond to highly conservednoncoding sequences (CNS) identified by comparing the
sequences of gene loci in two or more mammalian ge-
nomesusingWeb-basedprogramssuchasVISTA(Mayor
et al. 2000; Loots et al. 2002; Bray et al. 2003) or Pip-
Maker (Schwartz et al. 2000). This point is illustrated in
Figure 7 for the IL2,IL-3, and GM-CSF genes. The en-
hancers may be located 5 /H11032of the proximal promoter,
within intronic regions, or 3/H11032 of the gene; they tend tocontain binding sites not only for NFAT, but also for
constitutiveorlineage-specifictranscriptionfactorsthat
confer cell-type specificity of gene expression (Agarwal
et al. 2000; Avni et al. 2002; D.U. Lee and A. Rao, un-
publ.).
Although bioinformatics comparison of genomic se-
quences is a useful strategy for identifying regulatoryregions,itdoesnotbyitselfdelimitindividualtranscrip-
tion-factor-binding sites; pattern-matching programs or
visualinspectionmustbeusedtosearchwithinthecon-served area for known binding motifs. Recognition sites
forfactorswithpoorlydefinedbindingmotifswillnotbe
identified in this way, although, if biological experi-
ments implicate such a factor, a CNS correlated with a
DNase I hypersensitive site is an excellent candidate re-gion in which to search for a DNA target. Composite
NFAT:AP-1 elements, and indeed all composite DNA
elements, present a particular problem for bioinformat-ics recognition of binding sites on DNA. Because pro-tein–protein interactions contribute to the stability of
the cooperative NFAT:AP-1 complex, either NFAT orAP-1 may attach to a suboptimal sequence if the otherpartner has bound to a high-affinity site. These subopti-
mal sequences are often recognizable when NFAT/AP-1
binding has been shown experimentally (see Table 2),
but are too degenerate to be useful in long-range screens
of extended genomic regions. It is important to note,however, that even bioinformatics predictions for easily

AbstractEngagement of the NKG2D receptor by tumour-associated ligands may promote tumour rejection by stimulating innate and adaptive lymphocyte responses1,2,3,4,5. In humans, NKG2D is expressed on most natural killer cells, γδ T cells and CD8αβ T cells1. Ligands of NKG2D include the major histocompatibility complex class I homologues MICA and MICB, which function as signals of cellular stress6,7. These molecules are absent from most cells and tissues but can be induced by viral and bacterial infections and are frequently expressed in epithelial tumours8,9,10,11. MIC engagement of NKG2D triggers natural killer cells and costimulates antigen-specific effector T cells1,10. Here we show that binding of MIC induces endocytosis and degradation of NKG2D. Expression of NKG2D is reduced markedly on large numbers of tumour-infiltrating and matched peripheral blood T cells from individuals with cancer. This systemic deficiency is associated with circulating tumour-derived soluble MICA, causing the downregulation of NKG2D and in turn severe impairment of the responsiveness of tumour-antigen-specific effector T cells. This mode of T-cell silencing may promote tumour immune evasion and, by inference, compromise host resistance to infections.

Abstract
Machine learning (ML) is a key technology for accurate prediction of antibody-antigen binding. Two
orthogonal problems hinder the application of ML to antibody-speci ﬁcity prediction and the benchmarking
thereof: The lack of a uni ﬁed ML formalization of immunological antibody speci ﬁcity prediction problems
and the unavailability of large-scale synthetic benchmarking datasets of real-world relevance. Here, we
developed the Absolut! software suite that enables parameter-based unconstrained generation of synthetic
lattice-based 3D-antibody-antigen binding structures with ground-truth access to conformational paratope,
epitope, and af ﬁnity. We formalized common immunological antibody speci ﬁcity prediction problems as
ML tasks and con ﬁrmed that for both sequence and structure-based tasks, accuracy-based rankings of ML
methods trained on experimental data hold for ML methods trained on Absolut!-generated data. The
Absolut! framework thus enables real-world relevant development and benchmarking of ML strategies for
biotherapeutics design.

Introduction
Antibodies bind foreign molecules (antigens) with high speci ﬁcity. Antibody therapeutics have led to
impressive medical breakthroughs in the treatment of infection, cancer, and autoimmunity1,2. The 3D
antibody-antigen binding interface is formed by the paratope on the antibody side, and the epitope on the
antigen side3,4. The antibody CDRH3 (complementarity determining region of the heavy chain) region
contributes predominantly to the paratope5–7.
The prediction of the 3D (or conformational) paratope and/or epitope for an antibody-antigen pair is crucial
for addressing long-standing problems in computational antibody8–13and vaccine design14,15.
3D-antibody-antigen complexes resolved at the atomic level represent the gold standard for describing
antibody-antigen binding but they are time and cost-intensive to generate. Currently, there exist only ≈103
non-redundant antibody-antigen structures16–18, which is many orders of magnitudes smaller than the
diversity of antibody sequences (>1013)19. Furthermore, af ﬁnity values remain unavailable for the majority of
both 3D-structural datasets and antigen-speci ﬁc antibody sequences obtained from repertoire20or
library-based screening approaches21. The lack of structural antibody-antigen binding data combined with
the complexity of antibody-antigen binding22,23and protein-protein docking24–27are one of the main
reasons why the prediction of antibody-antigen binding remains an unresolved problem.
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used for antibody-antigen binding prediction5,10,21,28–41given its
capacity to infer the hidden nonlinear rules underlying high-complexity protein-protein interaction37,42–47;
with rules including long-distance dependencies between amino acids at the binding interface. Such ML
methods encompass sequence-based paratope prediction5,7,29,48–50and paratope-epitope-linked prediction
5,37,49,51while varying in the extent of inclusion of structural information. Structure- or sequence-based
binding prediction may be feasible provided that suf ﬁciently large antigen(epitope)-speci ﬁc antibody
datasets become available16,17,52–56. Currently, ML applications are developed on very small or
incomplete-knowledge datasets (joint information on paratope, epitope, af ﬁnity is unavailable, size of
datasets usually <10 000 antibodies)57. Restricted experimental datasets allow neither the benchmarking
and stress testing of ML methods nor the veri ﬁcation whether ML conclusions generalize to other datasets.
Simulation allows the generation of synthetic complete-knowledge ground-truth datasets (i.e., datasets
whose generation rules are known and therefore contain validated properties to be learned) containing
desired levels of signal and noise that re ﬂect experimental settings and biological mechanisms58–60.
Simulated datasets have been used in methodological development and calibration before large-scale
datasets become available, to disentangle machine learning hypotheses and to prioritize the design of
future experiments61,62. For antibody-antigen binding prediction, simulations may help precisely and
meaningfully de ﬁne different real-world antibody-antigen binding problems, which requires levels of
annotation that are not yet available in experimental data. Furthermore, the simulation of ground-truth
complete-knowledge datasets is critical for benchmarking or ranking ML prediction strategies. Since ML
encodings span sequence- to structure- to hybrid formalizations, simulated antibody-antigen data need to
(i) recapitulate structural levels of complexity of experimental antibody-antigen binding (especially for
deﬁning paratopes and epitopes); (ii) enable the generation of large-scale datasets; and (iii) allow the
integration of sequence and structural information into hybrid encodings.
Here, we provide a deterministic 3D-antibody-antigen binding simulation framework to enable ML method
development and formalization on parametrized, large-scale datasets. Synthetic antibody-antigen
structures are generated as the energetically optimal binding structure in a 3D lattice and recapitulate
many levels of complexity inherent to antibody-antigen binding physiology, and allow for the exploration.

of various types of dataset designs that are largely unfeasible to generate experimentally. Speci ﬁcally, we
generated synthetic binding structures of 6.9 million murine CDRH3 sequences to 159 antigens (≈1B
antibody-antigen binding pairs). Our work is based on the premise that a successful ML antibody binding
strategy for experimental datasets should also perform well on synthetic datasets (and vice-versa).
Therefore, the synthetic datasets should be complex enough such that accuracy-based ML method
rankings can be transferred from synthetic to experimental datasets. For three use cases, we investigated
the extent to which 1D-sequence and 3D-structural information is required for achieving high prediction
accuracy of antibody-antigen binding: (i,ii) binary and multi-class classi ﬁcation of binding, and (iii)
paratope-epitope prediction8,9.We found that in silico investigated conditions predicted to increase
antibody speci ﬁcity prediction re ﬂect ML performance on experimental antibody-antigen sequential and
structural data.
Results
Formalizing and benchmarking antibody speci ﬁcity prediction problems as ML tasks requires simulated
3D-antibody-antigen data
Predicting antibody speci ﬁcity refers to identifying which antibody sequence(s) or structure(s) bind to which
antigen(s), and vice versa (Figure 1A), and remains an unresolved challenge10. There exists a large variety
of possible biological and computational problem formulations and assumptions (Supplementary Figure 1),
and a formal framework that enables a uni ﬁed formulation of antibody-antigen binding tasks is lacking.
Most ML formalized tasks fall into three main categories: (i) Classi ﬁcation: A binary classi ﬁcation predicts
whether an antibody binds to a prede ﬁned antigen or not (Figure 1A). An antibody may further be
separated in more classes describing the binding to one antigen (for example low-af ﬁnity, medium-af ﬁnity,
high-af ﬁnity classes); the binding to different epitopes on an antigen; or even the binding to different
antigens (Figure 1A), de ﬁning a multiclass (or multilabel) classi ﬁcation problem if an antibody can only
belong to one class (or to multiple classes). (ii) Regression: Prediction of an antibody sequence af ﬁnity to a
target antigen, or sequence developability parameter values. (iii) Paratope-epitope prediction: Prediction of
which residues of an antibody-antigen complex are involved in their binding interface (paratope or epitope
prediction, Figure 1A), or prediction of the matching between a paratope and an epitope, possibly in an
encoded form. Of note, beyond only encoding antibody and antigen sequences, all these ML tasks may
involve the reconstruction of complex data structures describing features of the binding interface, that can
be leveraged e.g., by Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures. All aforementioned tasks may also
be formulated starting from the antigen perspective and predict their binding to prede ﬁned antibodies
(bidirectionality of antibody-antigen binding prediction).
Each ML problem formulation requires different types of dataset structures and encodings, rendering the
comparison of their effectiveness challenging. Large and reproducible synthetic datasets can be
parametrized into speci ﬁc immunology problems. ML-task-adapted training datasets can enable the
relative ranking of ML strategies for antibody-antigen prediction problems, following the hypothesis that
architectures or ML strategies that perform better on synthetic datasets are expected to also perform
better on experimental datasets (Figure 1C)..

Figure 1 | Machine-learning formalization of antibody-antigen binding prediction tasks and pipeline for the high-throughput
generation of 3D antibody-antigen structure datasets.
(A)Machine-learning formalization of the biological problem of antibody-antigen binding prediction. The biological formulation of
the problem may involve either antibody or antigen, subsets thereof (paratope, epitope), af ﬁnity, sequence or structure or any
combination thereof. The choice of data encoding can be divided into sequence-based and structure-based ones, while hybrid
formalizations leverage both types of datasets (Supplementary Figure 1). On the ML side, predicting whether an antibody
sequence binds to an antigen may be broadly grouped into binary, multiclass or multilabel classi ﬁcation and regression. Regression
may be used to predict the af ﬁnity of an antibody sequence to a target antigen. Furthermore, speci ﬁc problems of
antibody-antigen binding may be, for instance, predicting which residues of an antibody or an antigen are involved in the binding
(paratope and epitope prediction, and generation of new antibody or antigen sequences). (B)Synthetic antibody-antigen binding
data generation pipeline using the Absolut! framework: the PDB structure of an antigen is transformed into a 3D lattice
representation largely preserving antigen topology and surface amino acid composition (Supplementary Figure 7). Datasets can be
generated with unconstrained size. CDRH3 sequences are then tested for binding using exhaustive docking (6.8 million binding
poses per each 11-mer of each CDRH3 sequence and antigen, Supplementary Figure 2) to identify the energetically optimal
binding structure. The presence of glycans on the protein is parsed from the original PDB and may be included in the lattice
representation. For each optimal antigen-binding structure, the 3D paratope, 3D-epitope and af ﬁnity values are obtained and
recorded. By screening 6.9 million experimental CDRH3 sequences of length 11 or more (therefore containing physiological amino
acid composition and dependencies )63, we thus produced a database (antibody-antigen binding matrix) of 1 billion
antibody-antigen binding pairs with 3D paratope+epitope+af ﬁnity resolution. The generated dataset encompasses the following
levels of biological complexity of antibody-antigen binding: 1) Antigen topology; 2) antigen AA composition; 3) physiological
CDRH3 sequences; 4) a combinatorially large amount of millions of possible binding conformations sampled during exhaustive
docking; 5) positional amino acid dependencies in high-af ﬁnity sequences; 6) immunogenic regions (binding hotspots, showing
clusters of epitopes that share residues. Turquoise residues are contained in all epitopes binding this region, while levels of red
show how often a residue is contained in an epitope); 7) a complex paratope-epitope matching landscape (that can be visualized
on reactivity network showing the organization of binding pairs according to a speci ﬁc encoding and can be compared to atomistic
experimental 3D-antibody-antigen binding data); and 8) a “broken similarity” binding landscape, where similar antibodies do not
necessarily bind the same antigens. (C)Synthetic antibody-antigen binding data with native-like levels of complexity is necessary
for understanding the relative performance of dataset design and ML benchmarking of antibody speci ﬁcity prediction methods. In
this manuscript, we show that ML insights (performance ranking of ML methods) informed by ML application to synthetic
antibody-antigen data, transfer to experimental antibody-antigen binding data.
Unconstrained generation of in silico antibody-antigen structures
We present the Absolut! framework that enables deterministic generation of large synthetic datasets of
3D-antibody-antigen binding at moderate computing costs. Absolut! simulates the binding of antibody
sequences (CDRH3) to antigens (from PDB) in silico (Figure 1B) using a lattice representation of protein
interactions (Methods, Supplementary Figure 2A).
First, Absolut! creates a discretized lattice representation of the protein antigen (Figure 1B), by minimizing
the dRMSD between the original PDB structure and its many possible lattice counterparts64
(Supplementary Figure 3A, Methods). Protein glycosylation is modeled as “inaccessible positions” on the
surface of the discretized antigen (Supplementary Figure 3A,B), which impact the binding af ﬁnity of the
CDRH3 sequences (Supplementary Figure 4G ), as observed experimentally65,66. We optimized the lattice
resolution (distance between neighboring amino acids) to reach an average RMSD of 3.5Å to the original
PDB (Supplementary Figure 3C–F). In brief, the protein antigen discretization step preserves realistic 3D
antigen sizes (Supplementary Figure 4B), shapes, and surface amino acid composition
(Supplementary Figure 7A).
Second, Absolut! enables the calculation of the energetically optimal binding of a CDRH3 sequence to a
lattice-discretized antigen. Brie ﬂy, Absolut! enumerates all possible binding poses of the CDRH3 to the
antigen67, computes their binding energy (scoring function) using the Miyazawa-Jernigan energy potential
68, and returns the best pose as the “binding structure” of the CDRH3, a step we termed “exhaustive
docking” (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 2B, Methods). Each binding structure provides 3D-information
on paratope, epitope, and af ﬁnity. The advantage of exhaustive docking is twofold: it screens the entire
lattice epitope space and ensures that the energetically global optimal binding is always found, in contrast
to docking of experimental or modeled structures69..

One billion Absolut!-generated in silico antibody-antigen structures as a basis for ML benchmarking and
ML antibody-antigen binding task formulation
We generated a library of synthetic 3D-antigens (including pathogenic and self-antigens, see Table S1) of
159 antigens from crystallized antibody-antigen complexes16, and further calculated the binding structures
of a database of 6.9 million unique CDRH3 antibody sequences obtained from murine naïve B-cells63to
the 159 discretized antigens (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 4A-C). Using experimental CDRH3
sequences ensures that antibody sequences possess, analogously to the antigen, physiological amino acid
composition and positional dependencies. The CDRH3 sequences were assessed for binding by
sub-peptides of size 11 amino acids for the purpose of computational tractability and consistency
(Figure 1B, “exhaustive docking” in Methods). The generated database contains 1.1 billion
antibody-antigen binding structures with conformational paratope, conformational epitope and af ﬁnity
resolution (Figure 1B). Human CDRH370may be used instead of murine ones, and showed similar binding
behavior in terms of af ﬁnity distribution and epitope convergence (Supplementary Figure 4H,I). Each
11-mer of a CDRH3 sequence required on average the enumeration of 6.8 millions binding poses per
antigen by exhaustive docking (Supplementary Figure 4D ), depending on the antigen size
(Supplementary Figure 4E), and required 7.9 seconds per CDRH3 on average (Supplementary Figure 4F).
This is a fairly moderate computational requirement in view of the 6.9 million CDRH3 times 6.8 million
docking poses per antigen. Therefore, the Absolut! antibody-antigen binding dataset is not only ultra-large
but also easily extendable.
Importantly, for ML analyses, Absolut!-generated data enables the extraction of various features describing
the paratope-epitope interface (Supplementary Figure 5), and mirrors the diversity of used encodings in ML
studies, from binary vectors29to 3D distance representations71,72. Altogether, the Absolut! framework and
the generated database of in silico antibody-antigen binding complexes enable the unconstrained
generation of antibody-antigen datasets designed speci ﬁcally for different ML problems.
Absolut!-generated datasets re ﬂect multiple levels of biological antibody-antigen binding complexity
A prerequisite for the real-world-relevant comparison of ML strategies (architecture, dataset design,
encodings) for antibody-antigen binding prediction is that Absolut! datasets re ﬂect as many levels of
biological antibody-antigen complexity as possible.
In the Absolut! framework, antibody sequences bind to an antigen with a large diversity of binding energies
(Figure 2A) and structures, as shown as an example, for the antigen with pdb-id 1ADQ_A (Figure 2B). We
arbitrarily de ﬁne “binders” to an antigen as those (CDR3–derived) 11-mer sequences within the top 1%
afﬁnity threshold (1% lowest binding energies, Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 9A, see Methods).
Grouping CDRH3 sequences (or 11-mers) by af ﬁnity classes of arbitrarily adjustable thresholds allows
exploring different de ﬁnitions of negative (non-binder) samples in ML tasks. Among the 159 antigens, the
top 1% binders used on average 62 different binding structures per antigen, with on average 17 distinct
epitopes (Supplementary Figure 4J–L), re ﬂecting experimentally observed antibody binding diversity73.
Analysis of binder sequences to an antigen (1ADQ_A) showed non-linear positional dependencies74of
amino acids as compared to non-binder sequences. (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 6)5,39. Clustering the
binding sequences to 20 different antigens showed that very similar antibody sequences recognized
different antigens (Supplementary Figure 14D ), which is a major current challenge for ML prediction tasks
applied to experimental antibody-antigen binding34,39,75(Supplementary Figure 14E-H )..

Figure 2 |The Absolut! dataset re ﬂects granular levels of the biological complexity of antibody-antigen binding.
(A)Afﬁnity of the 1 113 000 000 antibody-antigen pairs in the Absolut! database, shown as an af ﬁnity matrix of 159 antigens and
6.9 million CDRH3 sequences (left panel). Each heatmap tile represents the binding energy (af ﬁnity) of a CDRH3 sequence against
an antigen. The right panel illustrates the af ﬁnity distributions of the top and bottom three antigens in terms of median af ﬁnity. (B)
Diversity of binding structures in the dataset for antigen 1ADQ_A (see Methods). [Inset] Af ﬁnity annotation in (A) allows
custom-strati ﬁcation of CDRH3 sequences into binders and substrati ﬁcation thereof (the top 1% of af ﬁnity sorted CDRH3
sequences for each antigen separately) and non-binders (the bottom 99% of af ﬁnity sorted CDRH3 sequences). [Main panel]
Distribution of 3D-binding structures with respect to each binding class as de ﬁned in the inset. The x-axis represents the antibody
binding structures to this antigen, written as a 6-digit number representing a starting 3D position in the lattice, followed by a list of
moves in 3D-space (see Supplementary Figure 3A orMethods for details). Different CDRH3 sequences may converge to the same
binding structure albeit with different af ﬁnities (i.e., one bar with 4 colors re ﬂects a single binding structure containing all four
binding classes). An af ﬁnity class could be distributed across multiple binding structures (i.e., blue bars: very high-af ﬁnity
sequences, are found across multiple structures in the x-axis). Only 159 of the total 842 identi ﬁed binding structures are shown for
legibility, only 65 of them are used by the top 1% binding sequences. (C)Positional dependencies are illustrated by comparing the
observed conditional probabilities of an amino acid A k+1at position k+1, knowing the amino acid A kat the previous position
(p(A k+1|Ak)), between binders and non-binders (Δp(A k+1|Ak) = p(A k+1|Ak) (binder) - p(A k+1|Ak) (non-binder). Positional dependencies at
longer range, are shown in Supplementary Figure 6 for amino acids within a distance up to 5 and 11 amino acids, instead of only 2
amino acids here). Red squares denote a case where two consecutive amino acids are more highly dependent in binders than in
non-binders, while blue squares show more negatively dependent consecutive amino acids in binders than in non-binders. (D)
Binding hotspots identi ﬁed for antigen 1ADQ_A, named H1 to H4 (see Methods and Supplementary Figure 22). (E)The
paratope-epitope binding network (reactivity network) constructed with the Absolut! dataset (left) shows a complex topology with
oligo- and polyspeci ﬁc characteristics also found in experimentally determined reactivity networks5,16. Different paratope-epitope
encodings determine different reactivity networks. The network shows gapped structural interaction motifs, for instance, epitope
X1X2X3XX82X3XXXXXXX and paratope XXXX1XX1XXX where X denotes an interacting residue and the numbers refer to the
number of non-interacting residues in-between (see Methods and5). The Absolut!-generated network contains 6092 unique
paratope-epitope pairs, with 2572 unique epitopes and 324 unique paratopes with this encoding. Epitopes are shown in blue and
purple, and paratopes appear in light or dark gray. Speci ﬁc epitopes (purple) are de ﬁned as being bound by only one paratope in
the dataset (all binder sequences use this paratope-epitope pair), while speci ﬁc paratopes (light gray) are only bound by one
epitope. The reactivity network degree distributions of Absolut! and experimental immune (antibody-antigen) and non-immune
(protein-protein) datasets using the most predictive encoding from Figure 5A are compared in Supplementary Figure 8.
To quantitatively describe preferential CDRH3 binding to speci ﬁc antigen regions, we developed an
algorithm to cluster the modes of antibody binding (epitopes of binder sequences) into, hereafter called,
“binding hotspots” (see Methods, Supplementary Figure 22, Figure 2D for 1ADQ_A), mirroring the
concept of immunogenic regions of an antigen76. Each cluster is de ﬁned by a core set of at least four
shared epitope positions between different epitopes (turquoise), while other residues are colored with
levels of red representing the fraction of epitopes (of the cluster) containing the residue, and white areas
denote antigenic regions that are more challenging to bind with high af ﬁnity, as no predicted binding from
the top 1% binders had its epitope in these regions. The number of binding sequences to each hotspot
ranged from 5 to 37 500 CDRH3 sequences for the antigen 1ADQ_A (Figure 2D ), suggesting the Absolut!
database mirrors the experimentally observed hierarchy of more or less immunogenic domains within the
same antigen77.
Although Absolut! is neither suited nor designed to directly predict where an antibody sequence would
bind in the real world, we quanti ﬁed whether antigen regions predicted to be binding hotspots overlap
with known binding sites in experimental crystal structures. In 75% of examined experimental
antibody-antigen structures from which the antigens were discretized, the experimental paratope was
overlapping with a binding hotspot core residue on the discretized antigen, while this number reached 85%
when including binding hotspot side residues (Supplementary Figure 7B-E). Since for this comparison full
chain experimental antibody structures were compared with CDRH3-based Absolut! structures, the overlap
calculated represents an upper bound. This suggests that topological factors that make antigen regions
immunogenic are somewhat preserved in Absolut! datasets..

ML tasks are often set up to predict which antibody sequence binds to which antigen, according to speci ﬁc
encodings. The reactivity network of Absolut! links 53 000 binder sequences on average to each antigen.
Here, we compare the reactivity networks of Absolut! (Figure 2E, left) and experimentally determined
binders (Figure 2E, right, generated from 825 experimentally-determined antibody-antigen pairs5)
according to such encoding. In both synthetic and experimental data, we observed a complex organization
(tree-like structure) and mutually exclusive polyreactivity of certain binding modes (motifs). Properties of the
synthetic reactivity network are statistically more similar to the experimental antibody reactivity network
than to the protein-protein interaction network (Supplementary Figure 8).
Taken all together, although simplifying antibody-antigen binding, Absolut! encompasses eight substantial
levels of structure- and sequence-based complexity levels (Figure 1, Figure 2), a subset of which are
encountered in experimental antibody-antigen binding highlighting the relevance of Absolut!-generated
data for developing and benchmarking antibody-antigen binding prediction methods.
Absolut! allows the prospective evaluation of ML strategies with custom-designed datasets
To demonstrate Absolut!’s usefulness in assessing the ef ﬁcacy of different binary and multi-class
classi ﬁcation ML strategies (Figure 1A), we compiled three datasets (Figure 3A). Binary classi ﬁcation
datasets D1 and D2 were generated for each antigen separately. D1 was generated with 50% binders of
top 1% af ﬁnity (blue) and 50% non-binders containing both top 1–5% af ﬁnity (red) and bottom 95% af ﬁnity
(gray), while in D2 the non-binders are instead only de ﬁned by top 1–5% af ﬁnity (Figure 3A, Methods,
Supplementary Figure 9A). Our selected multi-class classi ﬁcation example aims at identifying the target
(class) of an antibody sequence among N antigens (class) excluding cross-reactive sequences (one label per
sequence only). The multiclass dataset 3 (D3) was generated for a set of 5 to 140 randomly chosen
antigens, by pooling the top 1% binder sequences to each antigen (Figure 3A), while discarding those
sequences that bind more than one antigen. The size of D3 depends on the number of selected antigens
and is imbalanced (Supplementary Figure 9B,D,E). As a comparison, including cross-reactive sequences in
D3 would reach up to 1 250 000 sequences to all antigens (Supplementary Figure 9C) and also allows
evaluating ML performance on the multilabel problem (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 12).
We compared a set of ML methods with respect to binary and multi-class classi ﬁcation, namely Logistic
Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) a single layer neural
network (SN n), as well as a deep (two-layer) network (DN n) (Figure 3B) where nstands for the number of
neurons in each hidden layer. For brevity, we showed the results for SN and DN in Figure 3C–G and the
remainder (LR, RF, NB, and SVM together with amino acid composition and shuf ﬂing controls for SN) in
Supplementary Figure 10. Nota bene, in this manuscript, we do not aim to optimize the architectures and
hyperparameters of the machine learning models (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). The ML investigations
shown merely showcase the utility of Absolut! in creating custom-designed datasets with varying
speci ﬁcations that can be used to explore and train a wide range of ML methods for antibody speci ﬁcity

Figure 3 | Classi ﬁcation of binding and non-binding antibody sequences with machine learning.
(A)Design of datasets for the ML task of classifying a sequence as binding in a binary (binding, non-binding) or multi-class (binding
to one antigen among a set of N antigens) setting. Binding is assessed for sub-sequences of size 11 amino acids derived from
CDRH3 sequences (see Methods Supplementary Figure 9). For each antigen separately, we de ﬁned binders as 11-mer sequences
within the top 1% af ﬁnity threshold (blue), non-binders as 11-mer from the top 1–5% (red), and the bottom 95% (gray). Datasets 1
(D1) and 2 (D2) have been created for binary classi ﬁcation for each antigen separately, and D3 for multi-class classi ﬁcation for a set
of n antigens antigens (Supplementary Figure 9). D1 was generated with 50% binders of top 1% af ﬁnity (blue) and 50% non-binders
containing both top 1–5% af ﬁnity (red) and bottom 95% af ﬁnity (gray), while in D2 the non-binders are de ﬁned only by top 1–5%
afﬁnity (excluding the bottom 95%), rendering this dataset a priori more challenging to classify since binders and non-binders are
closer af ﬁnity-wise. In both datasets, binders and non-binders were sampled as 11-mers taken from CDRH3 sequences of the same
length distribution, to limit potential amino acid composition bias (see Methods). D3 was generated by pooling sequences that
were among the top 1% binders across multiple antigens, labeled with the name of their antigen, discarding 11-mers that bound
multiple antigens to ﬁt a multi-class classi ﬁcation problem. We also discarded antigens representing variants of the same protein,
leaving 142 non-redundant antigens, i.e., different labels (see Table S1 for the list of discarded antigens). Due to the removal of
cross-reactive sequences, D3 is imbalanced, because the amount of binder sequences to an antigen that was cross-reactive (with
another selected antigen) were highly variable, as seen by the number of available sequences for D3 (Supplementary Figure 9C).
(B)Model architectures considered: Feed-forward neural network with a single layer (SN), feed-forward neural network with deep
(two-layers) (DN) of equal number of neurons (5–20 neurons; in this Figure, SN5 indicates a single-layer network with 5 neurons and
DN5 indicates a DN with 5 neurons), and four shallow learning methods namely logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), random
forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) (see Supplementary Figure 10 andSupplementary Figure 11). The ML models were
trained on the two tasks: binary classi ﬁcation (binder or non-binder) on D1 and D2 for each antigen separately, and multi-class
classi ﬁcation (prediction of an antibody’s target out of nantigens targets ) on D3. ntraining=80 to 40 000 sequences were used for D1 and
D2 datasets as training dataset while n testing=40 000 sequences were always used for testing, to avoid a bias of test size. For D3,
ntraining=200 000 sequences were used for training and n testing=100 000 sequences for testing (or scaled-down when less than 300
000 sequences were available, see Methods for details). (C–F) Accuracy of binary classi ﬁcation prediction of the considered model
architectures per antigen. One datapoint represents the accuracy to the dataset (D1 or D2) of one antigen (each point is the
average of 10 independent replicates, 159 points in total). Median accuracies among the antigens are shown in each panel.
Prediction accuracies of shallow architectures and conditions are shown in Supplementary Figure 10, including a control with
shufﬂed labels (i.e., where the causal link between paratopes and epitopes was removed) to quantify prediction accuracy on
randomized data. (C)All models, trained on 40 000 sequences from D1 irrespective of their network architectures, yielded accurate
predictions for the binary classi ﬁcation task with median accuracy values ranging between 0.988–0.991 (see Supplementary Figure
10for shallow learning). (D)Prediction accuracy improved as a function of the number of training sequences (here shown for the
DN10 architecture). The model trained on the least number of sequences (ntraining=80) yielded the lowest accuracy (median 0.86)
whereas the model trained on the largest dataset (n training=40 000) yielded the highest accuracy (median 0.988). (E)Prediction
accuracy (trained on 40 000 sequences) was slightly lower on D2 (compared to D1 in (C)) with median accuracy values ranging
between 0.891–0.918. (F)Models trained on D1 and tested on D2 yielded notably lower performance with median accuracy values
ranging between 0.704–0.744. (G)Multi-class prediction performance improved as a function of model complexity (number of
neurons and number of layers) and decreased as a function of the number of antigens (classes). We quanti ﬁed the accuracy as
macro F1 score78due to the class imbalance of D3 10 independent replicates are shown as boxplot for each condition and show
very little variation. Macro-averaging weights each class equally (see Methods). Speci ﬁcally, the median macro F1 values for the
model with the least number of classes (n antigens =5) ranged between 0.76–0.962 whereas the model with the most number of classes
(nantigens =140) yielded macro F1 values between 0.097–0.67, depending on the number of neurons and layers. Baseline shuf ﬂed
(expected) median macro F1 values ranged between 0–0.02 and 0–0.03 (Supplementary Figure 11). (H)Comparison of the relative
performance of ML architectures on a sequence binary classi ﬁcation problem when they are trained and tested either on an
experimental dataset39containing 7 894 binding sequences and 17 237 non-binders to HER2, or on Absolut! D1 where the same
amounts of binder and non-binder sequences were taken for 10 randomly selected antigens independently. CDRH3 sequences
were one-hot encoded as 1D or 2D vectors depending on the architecture (see Table 3). For each ML method (color), eight
“balancing conditions” (data points) were investigated where the relative amounts of binder and non-binder in the training was
varied, as in Mason et al. (see Methods and Supplementary Figure 24). One datapoint represents one ML method and one
condition, and is the average of 10 independent simulations for this condition (each time with a newly sampled set of binders and
non-binders from Mason dataset, and each time using the D1 from a different antigen for Absolut! dataset). The x-axis shows the
performance of an ML method and balancing condition on a Mason processed dataset, while the y axis shows the performance of
the same ML method and condition on the Absolut! processed dataset. As a general trend, the ML methods that perform better on
the Absolut! dataset also perform better on the Mason (experimental) dataset (Spearman correlation of 0.9 between ML-based
accuracies on Absolut! and the Mason dataset using identical ML architectures in both datasets).
SN and DN architectures achieved high median accuracy (0.982–0.99) for the binary classi ﬁcation use case
on D1 (Figure 3C). >4 000 training sequences were suf ﬁcient to reach accuracy values >0.97 (Figure 3D ).
Prediction accuracy was slightly lower for SN and DN architectures on D2 (median 0.891–0.918) underlining
the impact of the choice of the type of negative samples on the degree of dif ﬁculty of the ML task
(Figure 3E). Interestingly, models trained only on D1 using the amino acid composition of the sequences,.

reached a substantially higher accuracy than random (Supplementary Figure 10C): shallow models reached
0.63 to 0.73 median accuracy trained on 40 000 sequences from D1 (Supplementary Figure 10,
“AA-comp”) while all neural network architectures (SN5–20 and DN5–20) consistently reached 0.974
accuracy on D1 with 40 000 sequences on average across all antigens (Supplementary Figure 10B), which
was very close to accuracies using the one-hot encoding (0.989, Figure 3). In comparison, models trained
on the amino acid composition of 40 000 sequences from D2 reached 0.768 to 0.775 median accuracies
(Supplementary Figure 10C), which is lower than accuracies using the one-hot encoding (0.823–0.918,
Figure 3E). We further used an out-of distribution approach to evaluate models that were trained on D1 on
their capacity to predict binding in the D2 dataset of the same antigen (Figure 3F) (i.e., assessing accuracy
on the distribution-shifted dataset79), and found lower median accuracy values (0.707–0.744), showing that
training on D1 is not very informative to learn the delineation between binders and non-binders of D2.
As with sequence-based experimental datasets, D1 or D2 contain a mixture of sequences that bind to
different epitopes on the target antigen, and it is not clear whether ML models trained on sequence
datasets implicitly learn information on epitope speci ﬁcity. One can naïvely assume that similar sequences
bind the same epitope, and that the knowledge of the binding epitope of a few sequences could be
sufﬁcient to tell that other similar sequences would also bind with high af ﬁnity and with the same epitope.
To explore this assumption, we clustered 25 000 binder sequences to 1ADQ_A (positive class in D1)
according to their Levenshtein Distance (LD) and could observe 10 clusters (Supplementary Figure 14A),
which did neither correlate with the epitope nor paratope encoding of these sequences, showing that
similar sequences bound to different epitopes. We used an integrated gradients (IG) analysis80as an
attribution method to identify which residues were important in the classi ﬁcation of binder sequences in
Dataset 1 (Supplementary Figure 14B-C)39. To this end, the SN10 architecture was trained on D1 of antigen
1ADQ_A and each sequence was annotated with its IG weights of the trained model; i.e., a measure on
how each amino acid of this sequence quantitatively decided its output binding probability. The integrated
gradient approach allowed to cluster sequences according to their paratope and epitope encoding
(Supplementary Figure 14B) as opposed to clustering by sequence similarity, showing that the information
learned by a neural network uncovers properties of the functional similarity between sequences and
therefore may be used not only to ﬁnd new sequences with high af ﬁnity32but also with desirable paratope
or epitopes. The clustering was not due to a con ﬁrmation bias, as the clusters disappeared after shuf ﬂing
the labels of each sequence (Supplementary Figure 14C). Therefore, Absolut! can be used to benchmark
attribution methods for their usefulness in identifying the binding properties of antigen-speci ﬁc antibodies.
We assessed whether ML architectures for binary classi ﬁcation followed the same performance ranking in
Absolut! or in experimental datasets. We used an experimental dataset containing high-af ﬁnity (class 1) and
low-af ﬁnity (class 2) antibody sequences to the tumor antigen HER239(Figure 3H ). Using Absolut!
sequences from D1, with the same amount of positives and negatives as in39, the ranking of ML
architecture performances were shared on both Absolut! and experimental datasets.
In the context of multiclass antigen binding prediction (on dataset D3), we used SN and DN architectures
on multi-class classi ﬁcation varying ML model complexity (number of neurons 5–250 and number of layers).
The classi ﬁcation performance (in terms of macro-averaged F1 score) decreased with increasing number of
antigens (classes) included in the task (Figure 3G ). Conversely, the accuracy values improved as a function
of model complexity (number of neurons) with the largest models (nneurons =250) reaching between
0.67–0.932 median macro F1 depending on the number of antigens. In comparison, shallow learning
models yielded markedly lower median macro F1 accuracies (LR: 0.36–0.66; NB: 0.01–0.34; RF: 0.–0.15;
and SVM: 0.35–0.68 for SVM, Supplementary Figure 11A). The F1 scores for the largest model (nneurons =250).

were higher than those of models trained on D3 with shuf ﬂed labels (median macro F1 < 0.02) or using
only amino acid composition (median macro F1: 0.05–0.16, Supplementary Figure 11B).
To summarize, Absolut! is useful for comparing ML architectures and attribution strategies on different
dataset speci ﬁcations including the in ﬂuence of different negative samples design.
Impact of the choice of negatives on binary classi ﬁcation of antibody-antigen binding poses
We investigated the relative performance of different ML strategies on a structural antibody-antigen
prediction problem that classi ﬁes whether an antibody-antigen binding pose is of high af ﬁnity (the pose
classi ﬁcation problem81,82,Figure 4A) and assessed if the ML method rankings transfer to experimental
datasets.
Using antibody-antigen pairs whose experimental antibody-antigen structures are known (“binding pairs”)
as the largest currently available source of high-af ﬁnity binding poses, the DLAB-VS (Virtual Screening)
pipeline by Schneider et al.81models the 3D structure of the antibody sequence83, and generates 500
docking poses for a given antibody-antigen pair. The poses are compared to the experimental (target)
structure using the “fnat” score (Figure 4A, top panel and Methods). Any pose that is similar to the target
structure according to an fnat threshold was considered as positive (P). In contrast, remaining poses that are
not “high af ﬁnity” can be separated into different types of negative examples, that can be included or not
in t",Propose a reasonable hypothesis about how to develop and benchmark machine learning strategies for predicting antibody-antigen binding using synthetic antibody-antigen structures generated by the Absolut! framework.,"Research hypothesis: The Absolut! framework can be used to generate synthetic antibody-antigen structures that accurately reflect the biological complexity of antibody-antigen binding, allowing for the development and benchmarking of machine learning strategies for predicting antibody-antigen binding.

Research proposal: We propose to utilize the Absolut! framework to generate large-scale synthetic datasets of 3D antibody-antigen binding structures. These datasets will be used to assess the performance of various machine learning strategies for predicting antibody-antigen binding, including binary and multi-class classification tasks. By comparing the performance of different machine learning architectures and attribution strategies on custom-designed datasets, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning methods in predicting antibody-antigen binding. Additionally, we will investigate the impact of different negative samples on the binary classification of antibody-antigen binding poses, and assess whether the performance rankings of machine learning methods on synthetic datasets transfer to experimental datasets."

Abstract
We present an updated and integrated version of our widely used protein-protein docking and 
binding affinity benchmarks. The benchmarks consist of non-redundant, high quality structures of 
protein-protein complexes along with the unbound structures of their components. Fifty-five new 
complexes were added to the docking benchmark, 35 of which have experimentally-measured 
binding affinities. These updated docking and affinity benchmarks now contain 230 and 179 
entries, respectively. In particular, the number of antibody-antigen complexes has increased 
significantly, by 67% and 74% in the docking and affinity benchmarks, respectively.
We tested previously developed docking and affinity prediction algorithms on the new cases. 
Considering only the top ten docking predictions per benchmark case, a prediction accuracy of 
38% is achieved on all 55 cases, and up to 50% for the 32 rigid-body cases only. Predicted affinity 
scores are found to correlate with experimental binding energies up to r=0.52 overall, and r=0.72 
for the rigid complexes.

Introduction
Protein-protein interactions are among the most important processes in biology, playing 
fundamental roles in the immune system, signaling pathways, and enzyme inhibition. 
Proteome-wide studies have revealed that most proteins interact with other proteins [ 1]. The 
experimental characterization of the structure of a protein-protein complex is, however, 
difficult and not always successful. To complement experimental approaches, computational 
techniques for the prediction of protein complexes have been developed over the years, 
stimulated by the CAPRI experiment (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) [ 2]. 
Computational approaches for modeling protein-protein complex structures include ab-initio 
docking methods [ 3,4], homology-based methods based on the experimental structures of 
similar complexes [ 5–11], and integrative, information-driven methods [ 12], These 
approaches typically attempt to predict the most likely structure of a complex, but are not 
designed to predict how strongly the proteins bind or whether they bind at all. Thus a more 
complete computational description of protein-protein interaction also requires algorithms 
that can predict binding affinities. Although energy functions for affinity prediction and the 
ranking of docking poses are related, they are often developed specifically for their 
respective purposes and so far have shown varying and rather limited performance [ 13]. 
Example areas where scoring functions can be improved are entropic contributions [ 14], 
solvent effects [ 15], and the optimal combination of terms [ 16].
Essential for the development of computational algorithms are training and test sets that are 
reliable and sufficiently large. It is computationally daunting to sift the Protein Data Bank 
for structures of protein-protein complexes; the experimental conditions and accuracies of 
these structures vary widely and are not always straightforward to assess, and neither is the 
definition of the biological unit. Recognizing this, various benchmarks were developed that 
attempt to collect a reliable and well-understood set of data. Our docking benchmark, which 
after its initial development [ 17] has seen three updates [ 18–20], is widely used for 
developing and assessing docking methods. Key features are the availability of both the 
complex structure and the unbound structures of the component proteins, non-redundancy, 
and reliability of the data. Other benchmarks include DOCKGROUND [ 21], which also 
focuses on protein-protein interactions, and benchmarks that contain complexes of proteins 
with nucleic acids [ 22,23].
More recently we used our protein-protein docking benchmark as a starting point for 
developing a structure-based affinity benchmark [ 24,25], which includes the entries from 
our docking benchmark for which experimental binding affinities were available. The 
affinity benchmark has been used for the development of algorithms for predicting protein-
protein binding free energies, with a typical correlation coefficient of r=0.6 with 
experimentally measured binding free energies [ 26–28].Vreven et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIn this paper we present updates to our docking and affinity benchmarks, of which the 
development is tightly integrated. We added 55 new protein-protein complexes to the 
docking benchmark, for 35 of which experimental affinities could be found that were added 
to the affinity benchmark. These new additions to both benchmarks were then used, as an 
independent test set, to assess the performance of four docking algorithms and a large panel 
of affinity prediction algorithms that had been previously developed without seeing any of 
the new cases. This allowed us to assess the performance of docking and affinity 
predictions, both of which remained limited due to conformational changes, with an 
indication that low affinity complexes were also more challenging to dock.
Results and Discussion
Composition
We added 55 cases to the docking benchmark (Table 1). PDB entries 3AAD and 3P57 show 
two and three distinct binding modes, respectively. As in the previous versions of the 
benchmark, the complexes that display multiple binding modes were split into different 
cases. This represents an increase of 31% over the previous 175 cases. We could find 
binding affinity data for 35 of the cases, which brought the total number of cases in the 
affinity benchmark to 179, a 24% increase. In Table 2 we show the composition of the 
updated benchmarks compared with the previous versions. The most noticeable increase is 
for antibody-antigen complexes: from 24 cases to 40 cases in the docking benchmark and 
from 19 cases to 33 cases in the affinity benchmark, which reflects a surging interest in 
antibody-based therapeutics.
In the previous versions of the benchmarks, some categories are underrepresented, most 
notably the antibody-antigen cases (14%) and difficult cases (15%), while rigid-body cases 
are overrepresented (68%). Although there still is overrepresentation and 
underrepresentation in the updated benchmark, the newly added cases do not worsen the 
representation of any category, and achieve a more balanced composition for most 
categories. We examined the new cases on various properties related to size and flexibility 
of the component proteins, but only found the total solvent accessible surface area of the 
component proteins to be significantly smaller in docking benchmark 4 than the 55 new 
cases (p-value=0.05; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), with average total surface areas of ~24,000 
Å2 and ~29,000 Å2, respectively. It is not clear, however, to what extent this difference 
reflects changes in the content of the PDB. Finally, the cases in the docking benchmark that 
involve NMR structures increased from 16 cases (9%) in version 4 to 32 cases (14%) in 
version 5.
Performance of docking algorithms
Four docking algorithms (see Material and Methods) we applied to the new cases and their 
results are shown in Figure 1A. SwarmDock [ 29,30], PyDock [ 31], and ZDOCK [ 32,33] are 
ab-initio  methods, whereas HADDOCK uses bioinformatics predictions to drive the docking 
[34], in this particular case it uses CPORT to predict interface residues [ 35] and 
PARATOME [ 36] to identify CDR loops of antibodies (see Methods). Overall the success 
rates (at least one acceptable prediction for a benchmark case) ranged between 5–16% for Vreven et al. Page 3
J Mol Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 December 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe top prediction, 20–38% for the top 10 predictions, and 40–67% for the top 100 
predictions, comparable to the success rates on version 4 of the docking benchmark using 
SwarmDock and ZDOCK [ 37,38]. As expected, the success rate was much higher for the 
rigid-body category, with the success rates for the top 10 predictions at 31–50%, compared 
to 4–22% for the medium and difficult cases. The success rates also varied according to 
biological category, highest for enzyme containing complexes (29–41%) followed by the 
antibody/antigen complexes (13–38%) and finally the other complexes (5–36%).
We observed that the performances of the different docking algorithms were correlated; for 
25% of the rigid-body cases, not a single acceptable solution was found in the top 10 
predictions by any of the algorithms, and for 22% cases all four methods succeeded. These 
figures are much higher than would be expected if the complexes with correct predictions 
were randomly distributed amongst the rigid-body cases (16% and 2%, respectively). Some 
insight into why some interactions were inherently easier to dock than others, even within 
the rigid-body category, can be gleaned by focusing on the cases for which affinities are 
available. When all the docking algorithms failed to find an acceptable solution in the top 10 
predictions, the affinity predictors also predicted weak binding energies (3EOA, 3BIW, 
4M76, 3RVW, 4GXU, 3H2V). This is either because the complexes are indeed of low 
affinity, or due to deficiencies in the energy functions used in both docking and affinity 
prediction. The success rates were higher for enzyme containing and antibody-antigen 
complexes than for other complexes, as the latter tend to form weaker interactions.
We searched for features indicative of a successful docking outcome. We define a successful 
run as a benchmark case for which at least three out of four docking algorithms yielded an 
acceptable or better prediction in the top 100 predictions, while an unsuccessful docking run 
had at most one algorithm with an acceptable prediction in the top 100 predictions. We 
asked which features could separate the cases with successful docking runs from the cases 
with unsuccessful docking runs. Because a major driving force in many protein-protein 
docking algorithms is the desolvation of the protein components [ 28], we computed the 
buried interface area (ΔASA) upon complex formation, which is a good measure for 
desolvation. We further hypothesized that strong binders were easier to dock than weak 
binders. Indeed ΔASA and experimentally measured binding free energy achieved a good 
separation of the two sets of cases with successful and unsuccessful docking runs (Figure 2). 
Note that the correlation between ΔASA and the experimental binding energy is low, as 
reported in Figure 1B and discussed below. These two features were individually mildly 
predictive of docking success (for example, the seven strongest binders all resulted in 
successful docking runs), the combination of them could almost cleanly separate the 
successful and unsuccessful docking runs. Below the separating line, 79% docking runs 
were successful, and above the line the docking performance drops to 31%. The outlier 
2GAF [ 39] has the largest interface area of all the cases and a binding energy stronger than 
any of the other cases with unsuccessful docking runs. Below we discuss this complex in 
more detail.Vreven et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptPerformance of affinity prediction algorithms
The change in buried surface area, ΔASA, does not correlate well with binding energy ( r=
−0.16), even for the rigid complexes (I-RMSD < 1.0Å, r=−0.28), due to complexes with 
large ΔASA but low affinity, such as the snpA protease/inhibitor complex (4HX3), as well 
as high affinity complexes with low surface area such as the C836 (3L5W) and carlumab 
(4DN4) antibodies, which are highly optimized for cytokine binding. Similarly, the binding 
energy does not correlate highly with I-R-SD ( r=−0.24), and only a small improvement is 
found using a minimal linear model combining ΔASA and I-RMSD ( r=0.31) [ 40]. We 
further evaluated a number of prediction methods that include the specific geometry and 
composition of the interaction (Figure 1B). This yielded overall correlations of up to r=0.53, 
with a predictive power much higher for rigid complexes, up to r=0.75, than for the flexible 
cases, up to r=0.53. The best performing methods were trained using either the first version 
of the affinity benchmark [ 25] or using changes in affinity upon mutation [ 41], yet these 
functions yielded lower correlations on the new benchmark cases than the best correlation of 
r=0.63 previously reported for the original affinity benchmark [ 26,27,42]. The correlations 
were lower for the statistical potentials and docking scores.
For some of the complexes, the predictions were consistently poor across all methods. All 
methods underestimated the affinities for the antibody/hemagglutinin complex (4GXU), 
which features a glycosylated asparagine at the periphery of the interface, the C3D/integrin 
α-M complex (4M76), for which the interaction is mediated via a Ca2+ ion at the core of the 
interface, and the efalizumab/integrin α-L complex (3EOA), which is the most rigid 
interaction in the benchmark (I-RMSD = 0.39 Å). On the other hand, all methods 
overestimated the affinities for the actin/twinfilin (3DAW), ALM57/integrin α-L (3HI6), 
TolA/G3P (2X9A) and HIF2/ARNT (3F1P) complexes, all of which have high flexibility, 
for which the energy penalty of conformational rearrangement may not be well estimated.
Highlighted case: Poly(A) polymerase VP55/Vaccinia protein VP39 (2GAF)
Figure 2 shows that the combination of experimentally measured binding energy and buried 
surface area forms a good indicator for a successful docking run. The complex of Poly (A) 
polymerase VP55 and Vaccinia protein VP39 (2GAF) [ 39], however, is a striking outlier. 
Only a single docking protocol was successful, despite 2GAF having the largest buried 
surface area of all complexes and stronger binding than any of the other complexes that had 
at most one successful docking run. Furthermore, this complex belongs to the rigid-body 
category, with an I-RMSD of 0.69 Å, and we did not find co-factors or other aspects that 
might complicate the docking. We studied 2GAF in more detail to understand the poor 
docking performance. Inspection of the structure (Figure 3) suggests that the difficulty may 
be related to the deep cavity of the receptor being completely filled by the ligand. To 
quantify this, we calculated the degree of encapsulation of a protein by its binding partner 
using C α atoms, and performed the same calculation for all the benchmark cases in Figure 2. 
We found that 39 residues of the vaccinia protein VP39 are within the cavity of the Poly(A) 
polymerase VP55 (indicated in blue in Figure 3). This is the highest number observed in the 
set of proteins considered for Figure 2; 4FQI and 3BX7 have 25 and 12 residues 
encapsulated, respectively, while all other proteins have fewer than ten residues within the 
cavities (39 proteins show zero resides). Presumably the tight fit seen in 2GAF renders the Vreven et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptmouth of the energy funnel narrow, which may impact the ability of docking algorithms to 
find and enter the energy funnel. In addition, the tight fit may cause difficulty for grid-based 
methods (ZDOCK, PyDock), because even small deviations from the ideal position, 
resulting from the discreet rigid-body conformational parameters, may cause clashes that 
prevent favorable scores. Indeed, for a run with a finer rotational sampling (6° vs. the default 
of 15°), ZDOCK found a high-accuracy prediction at rank 23. SwarmDock was able to find 
a solution in the top 5. Small conformational changes allowed by SwarmDock, which may 
have alleviated steric clashes at the funnel entrance, could have facilitated a smoother entry 
to the binding funnel. Indeed, the lowest frequency normal mode corresponds to the opening 
of the binding cavity, allowing ligand insertion. In the case of HADDOCK, it was the low 
quality of the bioinformatics predictions for the ligand binding site (recall of 7%) that 
prevented the sampling of near-native solutions. Docking with center-of-mass or random 
ambiguous interaction restraints (two ab-initio  docking modes of HADDOCK) does 
generate acceptable solutions in the top 50 (data not shown). In general, it appears that the 
poor performance of the docking algorithms for 2GAF is caused by the inability to correctly 
sample or find the native orientation of the ligand within the receptor cavity. This makes 
2GAF an exception to the general consensus in the field that failures of docking protocols 
are caused either by inaccuracies of the scoring functions (including explicit solvation and 
entropy effects) or the difficulty of modeling protein conformational changes [ 43,44].
Conclusions
We have presented updated versions to our widely used protein-protein docking and affinity 
benchmarks with respectively 55 and 35 new entries. This represents relative increases of 
31% and 24% cases, respectively compared with the previous versions. The updated 
benchmarks have slightly improved the balance with respect to both complex types and the 
range of conformational changes between bound and unbound forms. They are available 
from the following sites: http://zlab.umassmed.edu/benchmark  (docking benchmark) and 
http://bmm.cancerresearchuk.org/~bmmadmin/Affinity  (affinity benchmark).
We analyzed the performance of four different docking methods and a comprehensive set of 
state-of-the-art protein-protein complex affinity prediction methods. We found that the 
newly added complexes provide a challenging test set for both docking and affinity 
prediction algorithms: Structure predictions success rates and correlations with 
experimentally obtained affinities are lower than reported using previous versions of the 
benchmark. These updated benchmarks will aid the community in improving these 
algorithms and increasing our understanding of biomolecular interactions.
Methods
Benchmark construction
We collected new structures for our benchmarks from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 45] 
using a semiautomatic pipeline. We first used the BLAST sequence homology search tool 
[46] to find protein-protein complexes for which the experimental structures of both the 
complex and the unbound component proteins were available. We also used the SACS 
resource [ 47] to collect a candidate list of antibody-antigen complexes. These complexes Vreven et al. Page 6
J Mol Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 December 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptwere then filtered using various quality criteria: (1) the complex structure needed to be 
determined by X-ray crystallography, the unbound structures by either X-ray 
crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); (2) the sequence identity between 
bound and unbound chains needed to be at least 96% with an alignment coverage larger than 
80%; (3) the X-ray resolution needed to be 3.25 Å or better; (4) chains needed to consist of 
at least 30 residues.
While constructing the previous versions of our docking benchmark [ 17–20], we deemed 
two complexes redundant when the pairs of interacting domains were the same at the SCOP 
[48] family level. Antibody-antigen complexes were considered redundant only when the 
SCOP families of the antigens were identical, and at least 80% of the antigen interface 
residues were shared between the two complexes. We used SCOPe 2.03 [ 49] (previously 
named SCOP 1.75C), which represented a limited update with respect to the 1.75 release 
used for the first four versions of the docking benchmark. To further compensate for the lack 
of SCOP coverage for the most recently solved PDB structures, we inferred their SCOP 
family level assignments using the older PDB entries with identical sequences and known 
SCOP IDs.
We manually investigated the candidate complexes extensively, consulting the literature 
associated with the PDB entries. We checked whether any residues were missing or mutated 
in the interface (allowing such residues only if binding would not be affected), and whether 
co-factors that affect binding were present or compatible in both bound and unbound forms. 
The starting point for the manual step was the first biological assembly listed in the PDB, 
although in a number of cases these were not accurate and an alternative assembly had to be 
used. When multiple entries were available for a complex or a component protein, we chose 
the entry that had the best overall structure quality. This was to some extent a subjective 
criterion, as we had to balance all the aforementioned features in the decision. For 
component proteins with NMR structures we chose the model that had the lowest interface 
root mean square deviation (I-RMSD) from the bound structure. Finally, we prepared 
structure files that included the fewest protein chains that correctly reflected the binding 
process, aligned the bound and unbound structures, and retained only those HETATM fields 
that we deemed biologically relevant.
We evaluated several properties from the structure files. The change in solvent accessible 
surface area (ΔASA) upon complex formation was calculated using the NACCESS 
algorithm [ 50]. The I-RMSD was calculated by superposing the unbound component 
proteins onto their bound forms, using the C α atoms for residues that had any atom within 
10 Å of any atom of the binding partner. We also assessed the expected difficulty of a 
benchmark entry for protein-protein docking algorithms [ 17–20]. Complexes with I-RMSD 
> 2.2 Å were considered difficult, and complexes with I-RMSD < 1.5 Å were considered 
rigid-body if their f non-nat  [51] were < 0.40. All other complexes were considered to be of 
medium docking difficulty.
We then used the set of complexes as a starting point for extending the structural affinity 
benchmark. For many entries, affinities were reported multiple times either by different 
groups or using different techniques. These measurements were mostly in mutual Vreven et al. Page 7
J Mol Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 December 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptaccordance with one another, typically within one order of magnitude in terms of 
equilibrium constant. When selecting the value to include in the benchmark, priority was 
given to affinities reported for samples matching the sequences of the reported structures of 
the complexes. When this criterion could not be met or still resulted in multiple values 
preference was based on sequence similarity and the measurement method. As in the first 
version of the affinity benchmark, most affinities were measured using surface plasmon 
resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry, or spectroscopic methods. The affinities of four 
new cases were measured using the more recent thermophoresis and bio-layer interferometry 
technologies. We also collected experimental conditions and additional thermodynamic and 
kinetic data whenever available. Affinities were measured at a pH in the 7–8 range, typically 
within the 20–25°C temperature range, and with an ionic strength of around 150 mM. In the 
context of affinity prediction we consider complexes with I-RMSD < 1.0 Å as rigid-body 
and the remaining complexes flexible.
Docking algorithms
ZDOCK  is an FFT-based rigid-body docking algorithm that performs a grid-based 
exhaustive search with a 15° or 6° rotational sampling in three-dimensional (3D) rotational 
space and a 1.2 Å sampling in the 3D translational space [ 32,33,38,52]. For each 
combination of the three rotational angles, the best scoring prediction in the translational 
space is retained, yielding 3600 or 54000 predictions for the 15° and the 6° sampling 
respectively. Here we report results obtained using the 15° sampling. We used ZDOCK 
version 3.0.2 that uses the IFACE [ 53] scoring function and the advanced 3D convolution 
library [ 54].
SwarmDock  is a flexible docking method employing a population-based memetic algorithm 
that combines a modified particle swarm optimization global search with an adaptive 
random local search [ 29,30]. Elastic network normal mode analysis is used to model 
flexibility, and the algorithm simultaneously optimizes translational, quaternion and normal 
coordinates, using the DComplex statistical potential as objective function [ 55]. The 
algorithm was run at the SwarmDock server [ 37]; swarms are initialized around ca. 120 
points surrounding the receptor and the algorithm was run four times from each starting 
point for 600 iterations. The lowest energy solutions found in each run were ranked using 
the centroid potential of Tobi [ 56] and clustered, retaining only the lowest energy member of 
each cluster.
PyDock  [31] is a protein-protein docking protocol built upon FTDock [ 57], an FFT based 
method that searches for geometrically complementary rigid-body poses in the translational 
and rotational space. FTDock predicts 10,000 poses which are then scored using an 
empirical potential composed of electrostatic interaction (Coulombic energy with a distance-
dependent dielectric constant ε = 4.0r and charges specified by the AMBER94 force field 
[58], truncated to be in between 1.0 and −1.0 kcal/mol), desolvation (based on atomic 
solvation parameters optimized for rigid-body docking), and a limited (10%) contribution 
from the van der Waals energy (6–12 Lennard-Jones potential with atomic parameters from 
the AMBER94 force field, truncated to be below 1.0 kcal/mol).Vreven et al. Page 8
J Mol Biol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 December 13.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptHADDOCK  (High Ambiguity Driven DOCKing) [ 34] is a semi-flexible docking protocol 
that uses bioinformatics predictions and biochemical/biophysical interaction data to drive 
the docking process. It uses CNS (Crystallography and NMR system) [ 59] as its structure 
calculation engine. The protocol consists of three steps: i) randomization of orientation and 
rigid-body docking via energy minimization driven by interaction restraints (it0), ii) semi-
flexible refinement in the torsional angle space in which side-chain and backbone atoms of 
the interface residues are allowed to move (it1) and iii) Cartesian dynamics refinement in 
explicit solvent, typically water. The final structures are clustered using the pairwise 
backbone ligand interface RMSD and the resulting clusters ranked according to the 
HADDOCK score (weighted sum of the restraint energy, the van der Waals and electrostatic 
energies based on OPLS parameters [ 60] and a desolvation energy term [ 61]). Note that in 
the docking performance analysis presented here, no clustering was performed and 
individual models were selected based on their HADDOCK score.
We used the HADDOCK web server [ 62], outputting 10000/400/400 models for the three 
stages of the protocol. Restraints to drive the docking were derived from bioinformatics 
predictions by CPORT [ 35], except for the antibody-antigen complexes for which 
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) identified with PARATOME [ 36] were 
defined as active, and all solvent-accessible residues of the antigen were used as passive 
residues to define ambiguous interaction restraints to drive the docking. The predicted 
interfaces (and their recall and precision) used for docking are available at the SBGRid Data 
Bank, along with all docking decoys and HADDOCK input files from the deposited 
HADDOCK docking set [ 63].
Affinity prediction algorithms
ZAPP  predicts protein-protein binding free energies using a linear combination of nine 
energy terms and a constant [ 26]. Only one term uses the unbound structures in addition to 
the complex structures, while the other eight terms only require the complex structure.
ConsBind  is an affinity prediction method based on machine learning in which the predicted 
affinity is a consensus of four learners [ 42]: multivariate adaptive regression splines 
(MARS), random forest regression (RF), radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, and an 
M5′ regression tree (M5 ′). The learners were trained using 143 of the 144 affinities in the 
previous affinity benchmark [ 25] with all 108 features extracted from the bound structures 
using the CCharPPI web server [ 64]. Information from the unbound structures was not used. 
The final consensus score is the arithmetic mean of the four learners.
Solvebind  is a binding affinity prediction method based on the global surface model of 
Kastritis et al. [ 27], combining the number of atoms in the interface ( NAtomsINT ) and the 
percentages of charged and polar residues in the non-interacting surface ( %AA charNIS and 
%AA polNIS):

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptwith α = 0.0857, β = −0.0685, γ = 0.0262, and δ = 3.0125 (obtained after four-fold cross-
validation based on the rigid-body complexes of the previous affinity benchmark [ 25]). 
Properties of the non-interacting surface were found to correlate with affinity [ 13,27] and 
may regulate solvation and electrostatic contributions to binding affinity [ 27,65].
Besides the aforementioned binding affinity prediction methods developed in our groups, we 
also assessed the minimal affinity model of Janin (ΔASA/RMSD) [ 40], buried surface area 
(ΔASA), the DOPE [ 66] and DComplex [ 55] statistical potentials, the PyDock [ 31], SIPPER 
[67], ZDOCK [ 68] and FireDock [ 69] docking scores, as well as contact potentials 
(ΔΔG_AW, ΔΔG_AU, ΔΔG_CW, ΔΔG_CU) [ 41] and a surface energy model (ΔΔG_V) 
[70] derived from mutation data.

Abstract
Background
Understanding the interaction between viral proteins and neutralizing antibodies at atomic resolution is hindered by a lack of experimentally solved complexes. Progress in computational docking has led to the prediction of increasingly high-quality model antibody-antigen complexes. The accuracy of atomic-level docking predictions is improved when integrated with experimental information and expert knowledge.
Methods
Binding affinity data associated with somatic mutations of a rotavirus-specific human adult antibody (RV6-26) are used to filter potential docking orientations of an antibody homology model with respect to the rotavirus VP6 crystal structure. The antibody structure is used to probe the VP6 trimer for candidate interface residues.
Results
Three conformational epitopes are proposed. These epitopes are candidate antigenic regions for site-directed mutagenesis of VP6, which will help further elucidate antigenic function. A pseudo-atomic resolution RV6-26 antibody-VP6 complex is proposed consistent with current experimental information.
Conclusion
The use of mutagenesis constraints in docking calculations allows for the identification of a small number of alternative arrangements of the antigen-antibody interface. The mutagenesis information from the natural evolution of a neutralizing antibody can be used to discriminate between residue-scale models and create distance constraints for atomic-resolution docking. The integration of binding affinity data or other information with computation may be an advantageous approach to assist peptide engineering or therapeutic antibody design.

Background
The Rotavirus (RV) particle is composed of three concentric viral protein (VP) layers. The intermediate layer consists of VP6 (PDB accession code 1qhd [1]), which is the most antigenic RV protein in humans. RV is the most important viral cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. Nearly all children will be infected with RV before three years of age regardless of social or economic status. Moreover, infant antibodies induced by virus exhibit poor functional activity compared to those of adults. We previously investigated the human antibody gene repertoire of RV-specific B cells from infected adults or infants. Although infant antibody gene sequences used the same immunodominant VH gene segments as adult sequences to respond to RV, there was a marked lack of somatic mutations in the infant antibody gene sequences [2, 3, 4].
Most recently we investigated the kinetic and functional advantage conferred by naturally occurring somatic mutations in VP6-specific human antibodies [5]. In this study, we investigated the effect of naturally occurring somatic mutations on the binding affinity of human antibodies to VP6. The effect of each somatic mutation in two highly mutated, naturally occurring adult Fabs (designated RV6-26 and RV6-25) was determined by mutating the amino acids one at a time back to the original germline sequence and measuring the resultant binding affinity. Our results suggested that the germline sequence codes for a low-affinity antibody for RV VP6, and somatic mutations in the HCDR2 region resulted in a higher-affinity adult antibody due to a much slower rate of dissociation. In the present study, our goal is to use data-guided computation to identify candidate VP6 residues for mutagenesis to further clarify the function of the naturally occurring mutations in RV6-26. We use a rational, integrative approach to identify candidate viral residues for mutagenesis to localize and define the complex surface topology of the major antigenic site on RV VP6.
Conformational peptides can be determined in detail from the atomic resolution structure of the antibody-antigen complex, which is most accurately characterized by X-ray crystallography. Due to difficulties often encountered in crystallizing complexes, other methods are needed to characterize the structure of many novel protein-protein complexes. Cryo-EM is a lower-resolution alternative when it is not feasible to determine the X-ray structure; specifically, when the complex has limited ability to form a crystal or it is difficult to produce sufficient quantities of the sample. While it is not possible to construct an atomic resolution structure with cryo-EM alone, the cryo-EM density can provide valuable insight and can act as a constraint for computational docking methods to predict an atomic-resolution structure. The antibody-antigen docking problem carried out in this paper is challenging due to the size of the VP6 trimer, which is composed of 1191 residues (397 for each monomer), and the potential flexibility of the antibody Fab, which is compose of 227 residues. However, biological knowledge helps to reduce the size of the docking search space. For example, it is known that the lower half of the VP6 is buried inside the RV double-layered particle and, thus, is not accessible to the antibody for binding. Docking predictions are most reliable when prior biological information is incorporated into the modeling process [6], and site-directed mutagenesis is a particularly useful source of biological information [7, 8].
The diversity of antibodies is due to the six complementarity determining region (CDR) loops, whose flexibility and large number of surface accessible side chains allow the antibody to match a particular antigen epitope. When such induced conformational changes are large, one expects docking predictions to become less accurate if backbone flexibility is not incorporated. However, the large binding affinity of antibody-antigen associations in general, and the RV6-26-VP6 complex in particular, may limit the size of conformational shifts upon complex formation due to the evolutionary advantage of constrained loops for tighter binding [9, 10]. We use the protein docking program RosettaDock [11] to perform simultaneous Monte-Carlo minimization of backbone displacement and backbone-dependent side-chain rotamer conformational changes.
RosettaDock has performed well in the blind Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) protein-protein docking challenge [12], including a situation in which one of the docking partners is a homology model with considerable structural errors [13]. In targets without significant backbone conformational changes, RosettaDock modeled nearly all interface side chains accurately while also finding nearly perfect rigid-body orientations of the partners. Although most RosettaDock predictions are performed without the use of prior biological information, recently an integrative strategy has been applied to computational docking of a homology model of an anti-tumor mAb with the known epitope of the epidermal growth factor receptor [8]. This filter strategy compared mutagenesis free energy changes computed by RosettaInterface [14] with experimental binding affinity information to predict a final structure with reasonable confidence.
In the current paper, our goal is to identify candidate VP6 epitopes of the human neutralizing antibody RV6-26 by defining an antibody orientation filter that combines the distances between interface residues of the docking partners with experimental binding affinity changes due to site-directed mutagenesis of somatic antibody mutations back to germline. Unique to this study is the use of somatic mutations, which occurred during the natural evolution of an adult human antibody. The orientation filter is used to select low-resolution RosettaDock model complexes for refinement. During a low-resolution RosettaDock search, each protein is represented as a backbone with the side chains approximated by their centroids. During a high-resolution search, all side-chain atoms are fully represented, and we use finer rotational and translational sampling as described below. After clustering the refined complexes, the RV6-26 antibody mutation that was most disruptive for binding following reversion to the germline sequence (Y66S [5]) acts as a probe for candidate VP6 contact residues.
Methods
Since a crystal structure is not available for mAb RV6-26, we built a homology model of the structure using the Web Antibody Modeling (WAM) [15]. WAM uses a large number of known antibody structures as the knowledge database for homology modeling, and then applies ab initio molecular modeling for those parts of the antibody that are too variable for homology methods. For all docking runs, we included an alignment of our Fab with antibody binding subsequences of known antibody-antigen complexes, which allows RosettaDock to restrict the antibody from assuming an unlikely orientation of its CDR loops [11].
Figure 1 illustrates the steps of the docking procedure. In the first step, we started with a complex obtained from a fit into a cryo-EM density with an approximate resolution of 22Å [5] and performed 1000 low-resolution Monte-Carlo simulations with RosettaDock, treating the antibody as a rigid body that diffuses toward the fixed VP6 trimer. In applications without a cryo-EM density to seed the simulations, it may be necessary to perform more than 1000 simulations. The starting structure was obtained by fitting the X-ray coordinates of the VP6 trimer into the three-dimensional cryo-EM reconstructions with the Situs suite of programs [16], and the X-ray coordinates of the RV6-26 model were fitted into the antibody portion of the density by visual inspection. Additionally, the CDR loops of the antibody were oriented toward the VP6. The low-resolution, residue-scale interaction potentials include residue-environment and residue-residue interaction terms derived from a database of interfaces, a contact score to reward contacting residues, a bump score to penalize overlapping residues, and an empirical score that rewards interface CDR residues that are known to make contact with antigens based on known antibody-antigen complexes.

Blue boxes indicate where prior biological information is integrated; yellow boxes indicate the use of low-resolution, residue-scale potentials; and green boxes indicate the use of high-resolution, atomic-scale potential functions.
In the second step, we used a somatic mutation score (described below) based on binding affinity changes measured when naturally occurring RV6-26 antibody mutations were back-mutated to germline. This score was used to filter the 1000 low-resolution RosettaDock decoys. The motivation for using this data as a filter is that affinity is a measure of the evolutionary fitness of each mutation that occurs over the course of antibody evolution. The adult RV6-26 antibody contained 13 somatic mutations within the heavy chain. To identify which of these mutations affected binding to VP6, mutant antibodies were produced corresponding to the reversion of each somatic mutation amino acid back to the germline amino acid. Somatic mutations also occur in the light chain, but we focused on the 13 heavy chain mutations because the VH1–46 is the known immunodominant region. Ref. [5] provides experimental details of the measured binding affinity changes between each mutant and the wild-type RV6-26 antibody. Briefly, each mutant antibody was created, expressed, and purified and a detailed kinetic analysis performed using surface plasmon resonance. Most of the mutants retained binding equivalent to that of the wild-type Fab except for the six amino acids colored red in Fig. 2. For the somatic mutation filter in the current study, we discretized the equilibrium binding affinity changes for each mutation into active and neutral states (red and green, respectively, in Fig. 2).
Figure 2
Antibody binding affinity map. Heavy-chain amino acid sequences for germline and RV6-26 adult antibodies, and the RosettaDock CDR scoring profile (TFN). Regions likely to be at the interface (CDRs) are highlighted in blue for the germline sequence. Active mutations in RV6-26, which result in improved binding with VP6, are highlighted in red, while neutral or negative mutations are highlighted in green. The TFN sequence is the RosettaDock scoring profile defined for this study that rewards True (T, orange) interface residues in the CDR region known to make contact with antigens, penalizes False (F) interface residues not observed to make antigen contact, and makes no contribution for Neutral (N) interface residues that rarely make contact with antigens and non-CDR active residues.
Figure 2 shows the heavy chain amino acid sequences of the germline and adult RV6-26 antibodies, and summarizes the binding enhancement conferred by each amino acid. The numbering scheme used in Fig. 2 is derived from the immunoglobulin variable (V) gene database (VBASE), in which a unique antibody amino acid numbering system was introduced [17]. The first profile (germ) of the alignment in Fig. 2 shows the germline heavy-chain sequence, where the residues highlighted in blue are the CDR regions. The second profile (6–26) shows the somatic mutations of the RV6-26 antibody color coded in terms of their effect on VP6 binding. Amino acids highlighted in red were associated with enhanced antiviral activity of RV6-26, while amino acids highlighted in green had a neutral effect.
The third profile (TFN) of the alignment in Fig. 2 is the CDR scoring profile that is part of the low-resolution score in RosettaDock [11]. For our application, we defined True (T, orange) residues as CDR residues that are rewarded for being in the interface; False (F) residues as non-CDR residues that have not been observed to make antigen contact in known complexes and are penalized for being in the interface; and Neutral (N) interface residues as rarely occurring contact residues and non-CDR active residues, which make no contribution to the score. Even though the RV6-26 residues Gly73, Leu90, and Ser92 are not CDR residues, they were labeled as Neutral in the TFN profile because they were experimentally found to be active somatic mutations. This neutral labeling prevents the CDR score from excluding these non-CDR active somatic mutations from the interface.
For each complex, we created a matrix D of pair-wise distances between the Cα atoms of the 13 residue mutations of the RV6-26 antibody and a collection of VP6 residues from the interface, chosen based on visual inspection of the cryo-EM density. Virus interface residues were selected for the filter from two of the three VP6 chains: B-chain residues 197–213, 253–282, 287–301, 304, and 308; and C-chain residues 157–173, 236–247, and 351–374. The rows of the matrix D correspond to theVP6 residues at the interface and the columns to the antibody mutations highlighted in Fig. 2. For a given complex, we can determine the shortest distance of each antibody mutation to the VP6 interface from the matrix D. These distances yield a vector d whose elements are given by

whose length is equal to the number of antibody mutations.
The filter score F of a complex is given by the following sum over all antibody mutations M (M = 13 for RV6-26)

(3)
and d
c
is a distance cutoff in Angstroms that characterizes our measure of closeness between the antibody and antigen. We classify a somatic mutation as ""active"" if back-mutation to germline has a disruptive effect on binding to the antigen. ""Neutral"" somatic mutations are non-disruptive when mutated back to germline. In Eq. (3a), an active somatic mutation contributes 1 to the affinity filter score of a complex if this residue is within d
c
Angstroms of the antigen interface. In our application, we chose a relatively loose cutoff of d
c
= 12Å to allow all active mutations the possibility of contributing to the score, including ones that may be more distant from the interface. It has been observed that many affinity-maturing mutations in singe chain Fv antibodies correspond to residues that are more distant from the interface [18, 19]. A smaller cutoff would exclude the contribution to the score of residues that are involved in affinity maturation yet may not make direct contact with the antigen. In Eq. (3b), we allow a neutral or negative somatic mutation to contribute 1/2 to the score if it is more distant from the interface than d
c . This essentially penalizes neutral somatic mutations that are closer to the interface than the cutoff distance. Of course, it is still possible for non-disruptive mutations to be near the interface, so this soft distance constraint penalizes but does not exclude neutral residues from contacting the antigen. In the final piece (Eq. 3c), all other somatic mutations do not contribute to the filter score of Eq. (2).
In the third step of Fig. 1, we performed a high-resolution docking refinement of the top filtered complexes. A backbone-dependent rotamer packing algorithm is used for side-chain repacking [20]. From each of the best low-resolution complexes ranked by filter score, we created 200 high-resolution decoys using the perturbation triplet (2Å, 2Å, 20°). This perturbation triplet represents a search volume with respect to the line connecting the protein centers. The first number refers to translation along the line, the second refers to translation in the plane perpendicular to the line, and the third refers both to rotation around the axis defined by the line and tilt relative to the axis.
The resulting high-resolution decoys were ranked according to their full-atom scores. Candidate complexes were determined by an additional round of refinement (1Å, 1Å, 10°) following k-medoids (k = 3) clustering of the top Rosetta-scoring complexes. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the alpha-carbon coordinates was used as the cluster metric, and the cluster location was given by the decoy with the lowest full-atom energy score within the cluster. We used k-medoids clustering because, unlike hierarchical clustering, it does not require linkage assumptions, and it is simpler than mixture model clustering. Unlike model-based clustering, which has the advantage of a statistical model that allows it to estimate the number of clusters, we must a priori choose the number of clusters in k-medoids; however, this choice is easily validated by visual inspection of the 3D complexes. The candidate binding sites were determined from the final candidate complexes by finding the VP6 residues within a 5Å radius of the RV6-26 Tyr66. This mutation was chosen as a computational probe because it had the largest effect on binding affinity as back-mutation of this residue resulted in an 83-fold decreased rate of dissociation [5].
Results
Following the creation of 1000 antibody-antigen decoy complexes with the fit into the cryo-EM density map in Ref. [5] as a starting structure, we calculated the somatic mutation affinity score (Eq. 2) of each complex for the filter in step 2 of Fig. 1. Because six somatic mutations were labelled active and seven as neutral, the maximum affinity filter score is 9.5. The highest score of the low-resolution complexes was 9.0. Figure 3 shows the top low-resolution RV6-26-VP6 complexes clustered by affinity filter score. As the filter score of the complexes increases, the RMSD tightens between complexes within the same cluster. This suggests that the level of uncertainty in the location of the binding partners decreases with increasing somatic mutation affinity score.
Figure 3
Affinity filter clusters. Top low-resolution complexes clustered according to filter score (FS). (a) FS = 7.5, (b) FS = 8.0, (c) FS = 8.5, (d) FS = 9.0. The RV6-26 Fv chains are shaded blue (light chain) and green (heavy chain). The RMSD of the clusters tightens as the score improves (increases).
Starting from the best 45 filtered low-resolution complexes from the top four clusters in Fig. 3, we created 200 high-resolution decoys each. The resulting 9000 high-resolution decoys were ranked according to their energy scores. We created the 9000 high-resolution decoy complexes by searching a small region of space defined by (2Å, 2Å, 20°) around each low-resolution starting complex. We then ranked the high-resolution decoys by full-atom score and k = 3 medoid clustered the top 100 with a pair-wise RMSD metric. The location of two of the three clusters corresponded to the top two full-atom scores, and the location of the third cluster corresponded to the fourth full-atom ranked structure. This third cluster had very close RMSD with one of the other two clusters, so we chose the top two complexes for a final refinement step (200 decoys searched in a volume defined by 1Å, 1Å, and 10°). The best refinements of these two clusters, along with a repacked and minimized structure of the best-scoring (F = 9.0) low-resolution complex in Fig. 3, represent the three candidate modes of binding summarized in Fig. 4.
Figure 4
Candidate binding sites. Candidate residues involved in antibody-antigen (RV6-26-VP6) binding as predicted from the three best computational docking refinements. The antibodies for the three complexes are hidden except for the tyrosines (red), which act as probes for detecting candidate viral residues for mutagenesis (green). VP6 side chains (all in the same monomer) that are within 5Å of a tyrosine probe are shown in green.
In Fig. 4, the VP6 residues shaded green are within a 5Å radius of the RV6-26 Tyr66 of each candidate mode of binding. For clarity, only the Tyr66 residues are represented from the antibodies. These tyrosines in red act as computational probes of VP6 residues. Our approach has the effect of marching these probes up the outer sheet of the neck of one of the VP6 monomers. The probes in Fig. 4 allow us to propose VP6 residues for mutation and measurement of binding affinity changes to discriminate between the candidate modes of binding. The antibody probes suggest the following VP6 residues for mutation and binding affinity measurement to test whether they contribute to the antigenic site that is the target for binding by the RV6-26 antibody: Glu262, Leu264, Gln268, Ile269, Gln274, Arg289, Met295, Arg296, Pro297, and Pro298.
The best scoring high-resolution model, shown in Fig. 5 and magnified in Fig. 6, is proposed as the Ab-Ag complex most consistent with current experimental information. The complex in Fig. 5 corresponds to the uppermost tyrosine along the VP6 neck in Fig. 4. The Model in Fig. 5 and 6 suggests that the epitope residues nearest the Tyr66 antibody residue are Met295, Arg296, Pro297, and Pro298. These and the other proposed conformational epitope residues are shaded orange. In Figs. 5 and 6, four of the six active antibody residues are within 5Å of the interface; namely, Ile57, Gly62, and Tyr66 from CDR2 (see also Fig. 2) and Gly73. All six active antibody residues are within 12Å of the interface.

Discussion
In this study, we proposed an integrative structure-based computational approach to identify the RV VP6 epitope for a human adult antibody. Successful computational docking strategies have been developed that integrate experimental data, such as NMR chemical shift perturbations, residual dipolar couplings, and mutagenesis data [6]. In these strategies, experimental information typically is used either as a filter to validate docked complexes or a wrapper to restrain potential complexes during sampling. For example, HADDOCK incorporates biologic information as an additional energy term to be minimized during sampling [21, 7]. To increase the power to identify the correct binding site, the strategy used in the current paper integrated knowledge-based restraints into the modeling process before, during and after docking; using, respectively, a cryo-EM density, CDR alignment score, and binding affinity data for somatic mutations. The cryo-EM density was used to constrain the starting point for docking simulations, and the CDR information was used to restrict unrealistic antibody orientations during docking runs. We combined experimental binding affinity changes, which quantify the evolutionary fitness of each mutation, with soft distance constraints estimated from the cryo-EM. We integrated this information into a score for each complex that acts as a post-processing filter after the docking models were created. The best, filtered complexes underwent high-resolution refinement then clustering to give three candidate binding modes.
This strategy is unique in its use of naturally occurring somatic mutations of a human antibody as a filter. The fact that all six active antibody residues were within 12Å of the interface (Fig. 5) corroborates the self-consistency of our choice of distance cutoff in the somatic mutation score (Eq. 2). A loose distance restraint was chosen due to previous observations that active residues often do not make direct contact with antigen [18, 19]. The somatic mutation score was used as a post-docking complex filter not unlike the filter used in Ref. [8] in which computational and experimental mutagenesis results were compared. In this study, we used RosettaDock, but the somatic filter score could be used with other docking programs. Another strategy worth pursuing is to use the somatic mutation score as a wrapper as opposed to a filter, which would involve wrapping the somatic mutation score into the energy function during sampling to obtain a collection of complexes enriched for active residues in the interface. A simple way to implement a wrapper with RosettaDock would be to use the CDR alignment profile.
In the applied result in this paper, the algorithm had the advantage of an initial distance constraint provided by a cryo-EM density. This gave us added confidence in the antigenic-site candidates found by the algorithm, and it provided a starting point for validation of the algorithm on complexes where only binding affinity data is known. Unlike the two candidate complexes (whose antibody tyrosines were further down the VP6 neck in Fig. 4), the final complex in Fig. 5 is entirely within the cryo-EM density map (data not shown). However, to avoid undue bias from the cryo-EM, we retain the other, less conservative complex predictions as candidate mutagenesis sites on the VP6 to validate in a subsequent study. If a cryo-EM density were not available, a reasonable strategy would be to simulate a large (105) number of low-resolution complexes to explore the global space of potential interfaces, and then choose an encompassing region around the largest cluster as the VP6 residues near the interface.
Affinity changes measured for the reversion of somatic mutations provides information about interface residues but not about specific antigen contacts. Additional feedback with experiment is necessary to unambiguously identify the interface. Thus, binding affinity changes caused by directed mutagenesis of the proposed viral protein residues will be used to eliminate false positive epitopes that we suspect in the less conservative complexes. Once residues from the epitope have been identified through this process, binding affinity changes from VP6 mutagenesis will be used together with the naturally evolved somatic mutations of the RV6-26 antibody that enhance binding affinity (Fig. 2) to infer distance constraints for a more accurate prediction of the complex than Fig. 5. The resolution of our final model in Fig. 5 is diminished by the potential error in the antibody homology model. After we obtain distance constraints from the VP6 mutagenesis follow-up study, we will perform conformational sampling of the antibody loop, constrained at the active site, to account for errors in the antibody homology model and loop conformational changes that may occur upon binding.
In addition to conformational epitope identification, computational docking that integrates experimental data may lead to more general in silico procedures for the prediction of antibody mutations that produce higher affinity, higher specificity binding to a desired target macromolecule than the natural antibody sequence. Studies involving the in vitro evolution of antibodies have shown that the diversity of structurally stable antibody sequences is much greater than the diversity observed in nature, which suggests that this diversity could be exploited for therapeutic antibody design [22, 23]. Computation coupled with feedback to experimental information is a promising in silico-in vitro integrative approach to guide the design or enhancement of therapeutic antibodies.

AbstractOptical label-free detectors, such as the venerable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor, are generally favored for their ability to obtain quantitative data on intermolecular binding. However, before the recent introduction of resonant microcavities that use whispering gallery mode (WGM) recirculation, sensitivity to single binding events had not materialized. Here we describe the enhancement mechanisms responsible for the extreme sensitivity of the WGM biosensor, review its current implementations and applications, and discuss its future possibilities.

Zulkhairi Abdul Rahim3Show moreAcademic Editor: Paul HarrisonReceived23 Dec 2018Revised20 Apr 2019Accepted30 Apr 2019Published26 Jun 2019AbstractAptamer has been long studied as a substitute of antibodies for many purposes. However, due to the exceeded length of the aptamers obtained in vitro, difficulties arise in its manipulation during its molecular conjugation on the matrix surfaces. Current study focuses on computational improvement for aptamers screening of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) through optimization of the length sequences obtained from SELEX. Three original aptamers with affinity against HBsAg were truncated into five short hairpin structured aptamers and their affinity against HBsAg was thoroughly studied by molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method. The result shows that truncated aptamers binding on HBsAg “a” determinant region are stabilized by the dynamic H-bond formation between the active binding residues and nucleotides. Amino acids residues with the highest hydrogen bonds hydrogen bond interactions with all five aptamers were determined as the active binding residues and further characterized. The computational prediction of complexes binding will include validations through experimental assays in future studies. Current study will improve the current in vitro aptamers by minimizing the aptamer length for its easy manipulation.1. IntroductionHepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening disease which majorly affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis B virus. The disease has been acknowledged as a major health problem which can cause a high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is estimated that 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B, and almost 686 000 people died yearly due to the complications caused by the infection [1].Morphologically, hepatitis B virion consists of outer lipid envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapsid core composed of protein (HBcAg) [2]. The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has reverse transcriptase activity similar to retroviruses. The outer envelope contains embedded proteins which are involved in viral binding of and entry into the susceptible cells (HBsAg) [3]. Surface and core proteins of hepatitis B virus consist of molecular recognition patterns that can be detected by the antigen presenting cells such as helper T cells and trigger the production of the antibodies through B cells. HBsAg is highly recognized by the antigen presenting cells and exists in several subtypes identified by its three determinants: a, d, and y [4]. The “a” determinant is the most crucial part of HBsAg as it is the immune dominant and immune protective determinant and therefore functions as the target for diagnosis and vaccination [5]. The “a” determinant is located within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, specifically of amino acids residues 99-169 out of 226-residues. At least three anti-HBsAg monoclonal antibodies which recognized the epitopes had been known with mixed results in their sensitiveness of detecting the wild-type and mutants HBsAg.Despite the availability of anti-HBsAg monoclonal antibody (MAb) in the laboratories, production of hybridomas in having MAb requires tedious procedures involving in vivo applications. High contamination risk through dealing with animals, risk of animal dying prematurely, and failure to clone the hybridomas which requires special facilities and media for animal cell culture made the development of hepatitis B detection though ELISA and antibody-antigen related procedure are costly in the less developed region of the world. In addition to the economical disadvantages, the chemical structure of antibodies which consists of proteins, without having proper chemical modifications, is normally subjected to the heat-labile properties and is sensitive to the macro- and microenvironment. Slight changes in temperature, pH, and ionic distribution in the blood might contribute to the dysfunctional of the antibodies. Therefore, the availability of the aptamers which consists of more stable and robust nucleic acids provides a platform of robust detectors which are highly precise and durable to the changes of the environment in comparison with their antibodies counterpart. While screening aptamers through conventional methods such as SELEX and NECEEM are timely consuming and require high-end laboratory setup and access to large DNA library database, screening aptamers through computational docking and molecular dynamics study are highly sorted. One of the approaches to incorporate computational study in designing aptamers includes introducing Random Filtering methods to selectively increase the number of five-way junctions in RNA/DNA pools, thus creating a potentially high nucleotides stem-loop number systematic library for SELEX application [6]. Another study involved the selection for RNA structure based on the thermodynamically stable secondary structure formation and performed the nucleic acids docking on selected ligands through high-throughput virtual screening procedures [7]. Therefore, as the computing power had increased tremendously in the current decade, the application of computational simulation for aptamer structure prediction and docking screening had become crucial.The sequence of aptamers against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) had been identified earlier in another study [8]. However, the length of these aptamers (80-90 mer) will interfere with its manipulation, such as in conjugation on the nanoparticles matrices. If the length of aptamers is too long, it will cause the steric hindrance effect in the aptamer-nanoparticles conjugation process, thus causing ineffective conjugation and decreasing product yield [9]. Long aptamers also tend to encapsulate the surface of the nanostructures in the process, thus limiting the number of molecules able to bind on the nanoparticles surface. In the targeted organ for diagnostics and therapeutics application, long oligonucleotides are associated with the rapid clearance of oligonucleotides-conjugated nanoparticles in the liver and spleen while increasing the nonspecific interactions with positively charged nanoparticles. This cause decreases sensitivity of long aptamers. Current study provides a platform for the postselection process after SELEX, where the aptamer region with high affinity to the antigen is stabilized based on computational analysis tools such as molecular docking and MD simulations, enabling the unnecessary region to be truncated out and keeping the aptamers length short to retain its function.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Structure Modelling of HBsAgThe initial atomic coordinates of hepatitis B antigen subtype adw were designed based on the amino acids sequence retrieved from the UniProt KB database (Uni Prot ID: P03141), due to the unavailability of the crystallized structure in RCSB Protein Data Bank. The structure of HBs antigen was predicted by I-TASSER program (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [10] and the structure model was visualized using PyMOL (version 1.7.0.0-1, Schrödinger, LLC). The missing side-chain atoms were reconstructed using DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer (https://spdbv.vital-it.ch/) [11]. The tertiary structure of the antigen was then submitted to PROCHECK web server (http://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/) [12] which generates the Ramachandran plot of protein backbone and to ProSA-Web (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php) where its range of application includes error recognition in experimentally determined structures, theoretical models, and protein engineering by using the Z-score function [13]. The structure optimization of HBsAg model was performed by equilibrating the structure in SPC/E water box [14] using GROMACS (version. 5.1.1, University of Groningen) for 20 ns, under CHARMM27 force field [15] for global energy minimization and position restrain for 100 ps. The final step of validation was the packing quality of each residue as evaluated in the Verify3D server, which represents the profile achieved with respect to the residues [16, 17]. The validated HBsAg structure was finally employed for molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies.2.2. Structural Modelling of Anti-HBsAg Aptamers Hairpin RegionThe sequences for three aptamers against HBsAg were obtained from the previous study [8]. The aptamers (H01, H02, and H03) two-dimensional structures were first designed using Mfold (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold) to determine the loop and hairpin structures [18]. Next, five shorter aptamers with two aptamers from each H01 and H02 and one aptamer from H03 with the length between 9 and 10 nucleotides were designed based on the loop-hairpin structures combination available inside the H01, H02, and H03 full structures (Table 1). Two-dimensional structure of aptamer in Vienna format obtained from Mfold was then submitted to the RNAComposer (http://rnacomposer.cs.put.poznan.pl/) to obtain the three-dimensional structures [19]. The hydroxyl in the deoxyribose and methyl functional group in thymine inside the aptamers structure were added manually using PyMOL “add molecules” and “add group” functions, before energy minimized for 100 ps in GROMACS. The root-mean-squares of each aptamer three-dimensional structure before and after the docking were analyzed using “RMS” function in PyMOL. Even though the three-dimensional structure of single strand DNA was designed based on the RNA structures from the knowledge-based RNA conformation in the RNAComposer, a study to proof the reliability of the designed DNA had been performed where 25 single strand DNA where nucleotide length varies from 7 to 27 nucleotides were designed using the RNAComposer and edited following the aforementioned procedure and compared with actual crystallized DNA structure deposited in the RCSB Databank. Minimal differences of RMSD (3.0Å-10Å) were observed between the DNA designed by above pipeline and its crystallized structures (data not shown).Table 1 Short single-strand DNA (ssDNA) aptamers sequence obtained based on the loop and hairpin structure available from each H01, H02, and H03.2.3. Aptamer-HBsAg Molecular DockingInitially, the designed HBsAg structure was minimized and equilibrated using MD for 20 ns. For docking, polar hydrogen atoms were added to HBsAg and its nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged using AutoDock Tools (http://mgltools.scripps.edu) [20]. The grid box with a dimension of 40 × 40 × 40 points was set around the “a” determinant region (amino acids 99-169) to wholly cover the protein epitope for the docking. For the aptamers, all bonds were set as rotatable. The molecular docking between each single aptamer and HBsAg was conducted using AutoDock Vina, which combines certain advantages of knowledge-based potentials and empirical scoring functions: it extracts empirical information from both the conformational preferences of the receptor-ligand complexes and the experimental affinity measurements [21]. Each aptamer-HBsAg complex with the lowest docked energy was selected as the best conformation. Molecular interactions between HBsAg and each aptamer complexes conformation such as the hydrogen bonds and the bond lengths were analyzed using PyMOL (ver. 1.7.0.0-1, Shrödinger LLC)), Discovery Studio Visualizer (ver. 16.1.0.15350, BIOVIA), and VMD (ver. 1.9.3, University of Illinois).2.4. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation of ComplexesDetailed molecular dynamics simulations using the complex structures were conducted with the CHARMM27 using GROMACS program [22]. CHARMM27 force field has been shown to be effective in protein modelling and used in several molecular dynamics simulations of DNA [23]. Similarly as HBsAg structure optimization MD step, each complex were solvated in a cubic box and keeping a distance of 1.2 nm between the complex and the edge of the solvated box. Sodium and chloride ions were added to neutralize the charge of the system and then were energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm. In all simulations the condition was set at the room temperature (300 K) and the atmospheric pressure (1 bar) to closely mimic the general experiment conditions. The NVT thermal equilibration was done with a constrained structure and a velocity-rescale thermostat specific to GROMACS. Subsequently, NPT pressure equilibration was applied with the same velocity-rescale temperature coupling in addition to the Parrinello−Rahman pressure coupling. The fully temperature and pressure equilibrated system was then used as the initial configuration for the MD production dynamic analysis. All simulations were conducted using a 2 fs time step. In order to verify the robustness of the results multiple simulations of the HBsAg-aptamer complexes combinations were conducted for a minimum of 20 ns following the same MD procedure. The results were then analyzed using common GROMACS functions such as RMSD and RMSF, while the formation of hydrogen bonds between each aptamer and HBsAg was analyzed using GROMACS “gmx_hbond” functions. Each complex total energy was calculated using “gmx_energy” function, while the distance between aptamers and HBsAg was measured using the “gmx_pairdist” function. The binding free energy between the HBsAg and each aptamer was calculated using the “g_mmpbsa” GROMACS function which implements the MMPBSA method [24]. A total of 250 snapshots were extracted from the trajectories between 15 and 20 ns simulation time and used for MMPBSA binding energy calculations. Hydrogen bond occupancy for each complex was calculated using H-bond occupancy function in VMD.3. Results and Discussions3.1. HBsAg In Silico ModellingIn current study I-TASSER server was employed to elucidate the HBsAg structure, since the crystallized structure of HBsAg is not available in the PDB due to its experimental difficulties. I-TASSER had predicted the formation of four helical structures in the HBs antigen. The helices domain are in amino acids 9-39 (I), 72-100 (II), 155-184 (III), and 188-223 (IV). Based on study by Gazina [25] and another independent study by Glebe and Bremer [26], S protein of HBs antigen consists of four transmembrane helical domains (Table 2).Table 2 Transmembrane domain amino acid sequence from UniProt KB and predicted by I-TASSER.The main Ramachandran plots for HBs antigen structure before and after the MD optimization are shown. The three amino acids in the disallowed region, GLN30, THR114, and ASN131, required optimization of their folding in the structure. After 20 ns MD of HBsAg, all the residues are in the allowed region although minimal increase from 76.5% to 77.0% is observed in the most favoured region (Figure 1). The HBsAg optimized structure after MD has 77% residues in the most favoured region, 21.4% residues in allowed region, and 1.6% residues in generously allowed region while no residues located in the disallowed region. The maximum deviation of the residues was 5.4Å with zero bad contacts.(a) (b) (c) (d) (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 1 HBs antigen Ramachandran plot generated using PROCHECK web server before (a) and after 20 ns MD (b). A, B, and L: most favoured regions; a, b, l, and p: additional allowed regions; ~a, ~b, ~l, and ~p: generously allowed regions; white areas are the disallowed regions. Glycine residues are shown in triangle. (c) represents percentage of residues that are most favoured in the Ramachandran plot of minimized HBsAg structure which is 77% at 1.5Å resolution. (d) shows the secondary structure formation, where the “a” determinant region (a.a 99-169) majorly consists of random coil structure. After 20 ns MD, out of 226 amino acids there are no amino acids located in the disallowed region while only Q30, T114, and N131 amino acids are in the generously allowed region.The visual inspection on HBsAg structures in Figure 2 shows the conformational change of HBsAg which happened after 20 ns is highly visible. After 20 ns, the cavity was seen to form near the cysteine rich region of C121, C124, T125, C136-C138, and D144 residues. This deformation suggesting the location for aptamer to bind appeared somewhere else in the epitope, due to the changes of the Connolly surface as the cysteine rich region of HBsAg might repel the negatively charged nucleotides as both the cysteine residues and the aptamer carry the similar negative charges [27]. The conformation of HBsAg near S113 and M103 (Figure 2, in circle) formed an anchor-like inward curve region which enables the aptamers to bind tightly compared to the smooth Connolly surface conformation before the MD simulation [28].Figure 2 Three-dimensional structure of HBsAg before (left) and after 20 ns MD simulation (right). Magenta colour shows the epitope region of HBsAg which undergoes an obvious conformational change after the whole course of simulation. The formation of anchor-like binding sites along the epitope suggests the location of aptamer binding.Figure 3(b) shows that the residue at N-terminal more fluctuates compared to the residue at the C-terminal regions, explainable through the RMSF values. It was discovered that during the dynamics simulations few fluctuations gone beyond 2 Å except for the “a” determinant region amino acids (99-150) and amino acids 44-69. Total proteins show that even less fluctuations exceeded 2.0 Å for the whole 20 ns simulation, as shown in Figure 3. The residues 44–69 with fluctuations close to 3.0-4.0 Å observed in the dynamics plots were located close to the “a” determinant region, which consists of loops structure. Residues Cys107 and Cys121 are the most stable amino acids, showing less than 1 Å fluctuations. Stability of other regions in the HBsAg overall structure is based on the formation of transmembrane helices, thus enforcing the protein to stay in the closed compacted globular structure as observed in the protein’s radius of gyration (data not shown).(a) (b) (a) (b) Figure 3 Graphical representation of HBsAg RMSD backbone for 20 ns (a) and fluctuations of HBsAg backbone (RMSF) for 20 ns (b). HBsAg was stable after 3-4 ns simulation, and the highly movable residues were locating near 50 a.a and in “a” determinant region (99-150 a.a).The compatibility score above zero in the Verify3D graph is corresponding to the acceptable side-chain environments (Figure 4). The averaged score for all residues was in the positive value, with 80% of residues being over 0.2. This suggests that the model has overall self-consistency in terms of sequence-structure compatibility.Figure 4 The 3D profiles of HBs antigen model that was generated using Verify3D server. Overall compatibility score above zero for the average score (blue-grey) indicates residues are reasonably folded. Most of the residues are located above score 0.2.3.2. Three-Dimensional Conformation and Docking of Anti-HBsAg Aptamers Hairpin DomainFigure 5 shows the docking pose of each aptamer against the “a” determinant region of HBsAg. Docking poses and conformations of each aptamer on the structure show that the lowest-energy conformer predicted by Vina for each ligand was not necessarily the best pose given the lowest RMSD. The whole aptamer docked pose RMS value against the initial truncated hairpin structure is provided in Table 3. It shows that the RMS value of docked poses varies between 6.0 and 8.0 Å. When all the bonds in the aptamer backbone were set to be rotatable, each atom will be able to rotate freely to interact with the receptor (HBsAg) surface following the force-field docking algorithm in Vina, thus also causing the break of the Watson-Crick base pairing at the edge of the hairpin structure. Although the RMS value shows high flexibility of the hairpin aptamer towards the protein receptor, the number of Watson-Crick base pairs in the actual aptamers conformation is still high, which is around 5-6 pairs (from aptamers sequence in Table 1). This enables the hairpin structure to be well maintained during the actual docking. Therefore, although the aptamers active conformer or that closest to the bioactive form was in many cases assumed to be in the hairpin structure [29], it is not every time the conformation of the aptamer in the docked structure may be in the active conformation as in Table 3 of Vina score where each complex Vina score was only slightly different. H03a tends to stay in the hairpin conformation compared to other aptamers. This is visible by the low RMS value in docking (Table 3) and significantly high Vina score (-22.175 kJ/mol). In other words, aptamers with high structure flexibility such as H01b (RMS value 8.944) were shown to give better Vina binding energy (-31.798 kJ/mol).Table 3 Number of atoms in each aptamer, Vina docking score, and Root Mean Square (RMS) value of each docked aptamer before and after docking on HBsAg. The RMS value of each aptamer was determined by aligning before and after docking structure using PyMOL.(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 5 Illustrations of the representative aptamers poses (a) H01a, (b) H01b, (c) H02a, (d) H02b, and (e) H03a (all in yellow) obtained after docking to HBsAg. One part of “a” determinant region is shown in turquoise, where most of the aptamer docking occurred. Intermolecular polar contacts are shown as dashed lines.The conformational analysis of docked structures shows that all aptamers bind to the specific locus in the HBsAg epitope and formed hydrogen bonds with the specific aptamer binder residues in addition to the intramolecular hydrophobic interactions. At least five active binding residues which function as the hydrogen donors towards aptamer were observed from almost all of the aptamer docking, namely, Lys122, Ala128, Gly130, Ser132, Gln129, and Asn132. These residues maintained the aptamers position in docking, which is observable through MD simulation. Further characterization of these aptamer binder residues for the whole course of 20 ns simulation is also discussed in the MD section.3.3. MD Simulation of Aptamer-Protein Complexes3.3.1. RMSD and Intermolecular DistanceRoot-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) calculation of docked HBsAg and each aptamer separately shows that HBsAg is more stable for the whole course of 20 ns simulation, although the conformation starts to reach equilibrium after 7 ns of simulation (Figure 6(a)). The observations were also similarly found in other studies of protein-DNA complex [30] which showed that protein-DNA complex binding equilibrates at 12-20 ns, thus justifying 20 ns as the current threshold of the protein-DNA complex simulation. The RMSD values of the docked HBsAg were highly stable, as they only fluctuate less than 2 Å at each docking complex after 20 ns MD simulation (data not shown). In comparison, aptamers have less after-docked stability, where the docked aptamers RMSD deviate in between 2 and 4 Å of the initial aptamers conformation. It was also noticeable that only H03a had taken more time to reach its complex stability which fluctuates up to 4 Å and only reached equilibrium after 12 ns of MD (Figure 6(b)).(a) (b) (c) (d) (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 6 Molecular dynamics trajectories of (a) RMSD of HBsAg in complexes, (b) RMSD of aptamers in complexes, (c) number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and (d) minimum distance between HBsAg and aptamers for the 20 ns duration. Each aptamer-HBsAg complex reached equilibrium after 7-8 ns of simulation except H03a, which is after 12 ns of MD. The aptamers vibrate heavily even after binding to HBsAg (b); however the intermolecular H-bond formed between aptamer and HBsAg increases the complex stability (c) and maintains their distance to be in between 1.5 and 2.0 Å (d).Due to hairpin conformation of H03a, the surface interaction between aptamer and HBsAg remains limited compared to its other counterparts. This also shows that although hairpin structure is always considered as the optimum conformation to stabilize the aptamer itself, it is not necessarily the optimum conformation for binding. Experimental procedure such as that performed in another study [31] is still required to understand the DNA hairpin effects on aptamer-protein binding. The overall number of hydrogen bonds formed between H03a and HBsAg is also shown to decrease over the 20 ns period, in comparison with other aptamer-HBsAg complexes. Nucleotide in aptamers has the ability to form salt bridges or hydrogen bonds with the receptor; in this case HBsAg is more crucial to maintain the dynamical interactions between the two molecules.The number of dynamic hydrogen bonds formed between HBsAg and each aptamer for 20 ns although it differs shares a mean between 5 and 6 hydrogen bonds as in Figure 6(c). Although it is not excessively high, it shows that the number is sufficient to give a constant minimum distance value over the whole MD period and to maintain the overall distance between the aptamer and HBsAg at an average of 1.75 Å. The active binding residues in HBsAg play an important role in maintaining the number of hydrogen bonds within the 20 ns simulation.3.3.2. Intermolecular Hydrogen Bond Occupancy by the Active Binding ResiduesActive binding residues are the amino acids residues which maintained the intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between aptamers and protein in the docking poses and throughout the MD simulation [27]. In other words, although the aptamers were dynamically moving during the binding, these bonds will keep holding the aptamer in-place, thus affecting its affinity. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds occupancy is considered a benchmark in determining the active binding residues. By understanding the hydrogen bond occupancy of aptamer-HBsAg complex during the molecular simulation time frame, the important interactions between HBsAg active binding residues and the aptamer can be observed.The “Hydrogen Bonds” plugin in VMD software was used to visualize the dynamic hydrogen bonds formation in between the complex. Figure 7 shows which residues that keep on contributing to the hydrogen bond formation, either as donors or as acceptors. High occupancy percentage is determined as the occupancy value higher than 20% while the occupancy value lower than 20%, although also recorded by VMD, is omitted due to the inefficient intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed. The result shows that several aptamers share the active binding residues, for example, GLN129, GLY130, and SER132 which are the important active binding residues for H01a, H02a, and H03a. They are located adjacent to each other, suggesting that any single amino acid backbone reorganization during the aptamer binding will affect the adjacent amino acids to coordinate closer towards the aptamer. This phenomenon is also observed on aptamer H01b-HBsAg complex, where the active binding residues are SER136, CYS137, and THR140.(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 7 Histogram of intramolecular hydrogen bonds with occupancy percentage higher than 20% for each complex: (a) H01a, (b) H01b, (c) H02a, (d) H02b, and (e) H03a. Electron acceptors are on the top of x-axis while electron donors are at the bottom. H02a shows the highest number of aptamer-HBsAg intramolecular polar interactions, and its DT13 and Lys122 hydrogen bonds are the most stable as they exist for the whole 20 ns (100%).In addition, aptamer H02b active binding residues are SER55 and LEU205 which are both located outside the “a” determinant region. The observation suggests that since the aptamer is a large macromolecules (nucleic acids) rather than drug-like small ligands, binding of the aptamer has to be inclusive of other potential conformational binding sites located outside the antigen epitope.Some of the active binding residues are also be able to form hydrogen bonds by becoming the electron donor through their main and also side chains. H02a has the most active binding residues that give more than 20% occupancy of dynamic intermolecular hydrogen bonds, namely, LYS122, GLN129, GLY130, and ASN131 of the “a” determinant region residues and also ARG73 and TRP74 (Figure 7(c)). Overall, the important active binding residues in the conformational structure are LYS122, GLN129, GLY130, ASN131, SER132, SER136, CYS137, and THR140 from the “a” determinant region and also the residues located near to the region which is SER55, ARG73, TRP74, and LEU205.3.3.3. Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA)MMPBSA method has been widely applied and is considered as a reliable free energy simulation method to understand the protein-ligand binding interactions [32]. Another molecular mechanics energies method is implying generalized Bonn (GB) surface area continuum solvation, thus known as MMGBSA method in estimating the free energy binding of ligands to biological macromolecules. The free energy of a state, as described by Kollman and coworkers [33], is as follows:where
is the calculated average free energy,
is the average molecular mechanics energy,
is the solvation free energy, and
represents the solute configuration entropy which can be determined by the quasi-harmonic analysis of the trajectory or by normal-mode analysis.
can be calculated with the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerical solution and the estimate of the nonpolar free energy with a simple surface area term. As the polar part of
solvation term is able to be solved by rigorous computational calculations, generalized Born is an approximate solution of Poisson-Boltzmann that is faster to compute, of which the equation gives the electrostatic potential around a solute in a solution.The MMGBSA method is considered computationally less intensive on the technical consideration, in comparison to MMPBSA. However, solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation has been treated as the gold standard and has been the basis for the development of GB parameters. Therefore MMPBSA method is considered superior in terms of accuracy although it is expected that these two methods are highly to yield comparable results when GB is parameterized properly. Nevertheless, there are no direct comparisons between these two important methods on large data sets [34]. PB employs a more rigorous algorithm than GB [35] but the GB parameters have always been optimized by fitting experimental data. It is difficult to mention which method is better as they show conflicting performance for different systems. Study by Lei Xu & Huiyong Sun et al., 2013 [36], shows that, for most cases, MMPBSA with the PBSA program and Lu’s radii set gives better ranking results than MMGBSA with GB. Therefore, based on the positive results showed by other studies, MMPBSA method was selected to estimate the free-binding energy of the last 5 ns of the aptamer-HBsAg complexes.In current study, MMPBSA free energy simulation obtained for each aptamer and HBsAg complex for the last 5 ns of the simulation (15-20 ns duration) shows that while H01a, H01b, and H02b aptamer-HBsAg complex gives a stable energy value, H03a had been fluctuated (Figure 8). The total energy value of the complex only starts to decrease at 17 ns. This suggests that, for H03a, the aptamer binding is not fully stable for the whole course of the simulation. The finding is also in line with earlier study which suggested that aptamer H03 has a lower binding affinity compared to H01 and H02 and also with the binding energy value obtained by Vina. In contrast, aptamer H02a gives the lowest binding energy averaging at -1303.080 kJ/mol while maintaining a constant low binding energy for the last 5 ns of the simulation. Here, MMPBSA method is beneficial in determining the optimum aptamers sequence for the binding against HBsAg especially when all the aptamers gives a relatively low Vina docking score and have a similar GROMACS total energy (Table 4).Table 4 Values of Vina score, calculated GROMACS total-energy, and calculated binding free energies using MMPBSA (kJ/mol) of loop and hairpin region truncated from each aptamer. H02a gives the lowest MMPBSA ∆E binding energy compared to other complexes.Figure 8 Total energy binding value for the last 5 ns of simulation (15-20 ns) as per calculated using the MMPBSA method. H02a shows the lowest total energy binding value which translated to the highest affinity towards HBsAg, while H03a gives highest total binding energy and less binding affinity towards HBsAg compared to other aptamers.4. ConclusionsThe thorough approach in determining the suitable aptamers against HBsAg by combining a multiple assessing strategies will tremendously improve the effort of aptamer screening. Our study shows that, by designing the three-dimensional structure of proteins and aptamers de novo, process of aptamers sequences selection against HBsAg can begin with the computational chemistry approach on a reasonable computational cost before expanding the study in the lab. Molecular docking are important to understand the aptamer-HBsAg complex binding orientation with the lowest
binding energy, while molecular dynamics simulation shows the stability of the polar contacts between the complex. The active binding amino acids residues are the key players for the aptamer to bind on the surface of HBsAg. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds occupancy can be utilized to monitor the affinity of each screened aptamer against HBsAg, while MMPBSA approach is a highly convenient method to monitor the tightness of aptamer-protein binding complex especially during the end course of the MD simulation. This findings can be used to optimize the aptamers sequences obtained computationally into the in vitro method, in order to enhance the manipulation of the sequences. In addition, the experimental study to determine the binding affinity
of the complex is still required to support the computationally derived hypothesis. The correlation between the theoretical binding energy and experimental
is crucial to determine the most promising candidate for the high affinity HBsAg-aptamer synthesis.Data AvailabilityThe data in the study is available upon request.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to acknowledge UniKL Malaysian Institute of Chemical and Bioengineering Technology, Malaysia, for providing the financial support during the preparations of the manuscript.

Research Proposal: The research will involve computational improvement for aptamer screening of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) through optimization of the length sequences obtained from SELEX. This will include molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method to study the stability and binding affinity of truncated aptamers on HBsAg. The study aims to identify the active binding residues and characterize the molecular interactions between the aptamers and HBsAg.
